Well, it finally happened. I had my first experience with LSD. Three hits of some of the strongest acid that's been around town in several years. I paid for one hit, and one of my best friends gave me the other two, because we hadn't hung out in a while. About thirty minutes after taking it, the dealer called one of my other friends. My friends told us the dealer said, 'Don't take two. It's too strong.' I doubted that, but that doubt slowly vanished as the trip kicked in. I saw a sheet of the stuff, and it was pink, purple, and had a very cool design of two aliens on it. My friends bought about an ounce of weed for the day, and we were set.<br>
<br>
It all started in the woods. It was a very beautiful day. Perfect. We rolled a couple joints in our favorite spot, and smoked. I had taken all three hits of my acid about thirty minutes before we got to the woods. My friend had taken his two hits (he had done acid before), and my other friend had taken one. He would take one more later, when someone gave him a hit. After a while, I noticed myself smiling, for no real reason at all. I would just walk around, smiling my ass off, looking at all the pretty trees. Smiling soon turned to giggling stupidly at the smallest things. It was around that time I got my first hallucination.<br>
<br>
I saw a video camera up in the trees for a moment. I knew it wasn't really there, but it was still very strange to see a camera up there. At this point, there was no way you could make me unhappy. Everything was funny. I loved to talk, walk, and do just about everything. I had a cigarette at around this time, and it was great. Smoking menthol cigarettes was one of my favorite things to do during the trip. We saw that it was going to rain, so we decided to drive to my friend's brother's place<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</FONT>, which was a kickass apartment community filled with good friends who all knew each other. The friend who had taken one hit had to go home for a little while, so he dropped us off there.<br>
<br>
At this time, I was slowly drifting into insanity. Not insanity in the sense that I was a raving lunatic running around, but in the sense that I knew the world I was seeing in front of me was nothing close to the world that I was really in. I could look out into the horizon and see the world melting. Right about now, the visuals were basically distortions of real things around me, but strange, nonsensical distortions. There were a group of guys playing volleyball outside, and at one point the volleyball looked like a ball of glowing orange light.<br>
<br>
I have to add that during all this, I kept taking my sunglasses off, then putting them back on. Putting my sight through this 'filter' made things take a whole new visual quality to them. Light became distorted, and whenever I would look at any source of light, crazy things would happen. I would describe some of the visuals here, but it would be a waste of time, because the real visuals were so much more.<br>
<br>
My friend's brother decided he wanted to buy 25 hits of acid from the dealer from earlier. So we went along for the car ride. Boom. Complete insanity. It all started in the car, on the way to the dealer's house. It started raining hard. Now there weren't just normal objects changing before my eyes. I was seeing things that were not there. Hundreds of paratroopers in the sky, slowly falling to the ground over the horizon. All the trees were on fire, with smoke coming off of them, forming outlines and patterns that I was not familiar with. An army of chameleons was marching along the lane, which had no oncoming traffic. They had different-colored uniforms on, and you could tell that it had something to do with their rank.<br>
<br>
It was storming. You could barely see out of the car. The large droplets of water coming off of the windows started to look like blood. I looked back on the road, and it wasn't a road anymore. It was a vein. We were inside something's body, riding atop a large, winding vein. Thankfully the brightness of the sun prevented this vision from taking over my mind for more than a few seconds.<br>
<br>
We were on a slight slant on the road during a red light. I thought everything was starting to lean that way, and that soon the world would be on such a tilt that I would fall into the horizon. There was a water tower to the right of me, and we were being tilted to the left. I thought I was looking straight up at the water tower, and I tried to grab onto it to keep from falling. That didn't work, so I grabbed onto the car. Riding in a car was like riding on a roller coaster. I felt like the car we were in was huge, a large machine that I had to grab on to to prevent from being slung around.<br>
<br>
Got to the dealer's house, got the stuff, then left. One of the most interesting things to note is that my inner-monologue was extremely exaggerated. Someone could be looking right at me, talking to me, and I would just be staring back at them, thinking in my mind, 'What is he saying to me? I know he's talking to me, but what is he saying to me?' Also, I would analyze every single little thing, making it extremely difficult to focus on small, unimportant things like talking to people. I would be staring off into space, thinking 'Did that guy just try to offend me, or was he just joking around, being nice?'<br>
<br>
One thing I kept seeing throughout the trip was paratroopers in the sky, with their white parachutes billowing in the wind. Some stupid preppy jock guy was trying to mess with me during the peak of my trip. He was in his car, flashing his lights at me, trying to trip me out. I went up to the car and said something to the effect of, 'I look in the sky and see hundreds of paratroopers descending down. Do you really think that flashing your fucking lights at me is going to trip me out, you moron?'<br>
<br>
A bunch of people wanted to watch Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas, because it was obviously appropriate, and we all love that movie to death. It was very ironic and cliche to be watching that movie at that exact time. I didn't sit there and watch it, because it was much more interesting to walk around and experience things, but it was just fun to see it every time I went back in the apartment.<br>
<br>
I kept thinking vultures were picking at my head. I would have an image in my head of vultures swooping down and grabbing my hair, but I would look up and see nothing but sky. The world would take on a strange look to it, almost as if it was being reflected to me in a giant puddle of water, and someone spilled oil in it, giving it that swirling rainbow look to it. It took all I had not to lose control. If I didn't have the amount of experience I have, I know that I would have been in the depths of a horrible trip. I already was in the depths of a horrible trip, but it was just so good.<br>
<br>
A few times in the trip, I would see things as they're normally seen, but in hundreds of times more detail than I'm used to. I could look at bushes, and see every leaf, every branch. I could look at a bug and see every moving part of the bug, every joint, every feeler, leg, eye, etc. It was in this viewpoint that I thought my mind was being used to its maximum potential. I thought of how advanced our civilization would be if everyone saw in this way, all the time. Everything was so detailed, and at any given moment I could pick out anything I was seeing, and fully concentrate on it, seeing and understanding it in a way I had never felt before. Think of my vision changing as going from playing Goldeneye to Half-Life 2. Everything had so much greater detail to it. Things were clearer, more vivid, etc.<br>
<br>
I would look at the ceiling, and see it melting away outwardly, into the sky. I thought the entire room was expanding quickly. I had to grip the sofa, because it was expanding just as fast. I saw my friend fading away in the distance as the couch stretched itself out in miles.<br>
<br>
My friend's brother had a bunch of sparklers that we had a blast with. I would light one, and I would see every spark that came off of it as a tiny screaming face, shattering into a million pieces as it hit the ground. I actually wanted to stop lighting sparklers because of this reason, because I felt bad for all the faces, which I saw in great detail, with their burning eyes staring up at me, almost in a way that asked, 'Why are you doing this to us?' Keep in mind, these were tiny sparks, and I saw every facial expression they made. Remember what I said about everything being more vivid and more detailed. I don't know how else to explain it.<br>
<br>
Smoke was very interesting to look at. I could see every little particle of smoke, and I could see it being absorbed into my clothes, into my skin. As the smoke moved, it resembled an ocean. A large, moving body of particles, that would conform to itself and its properties. One particle wouldn't move on its own, if one moved, the rest of the mass would slowly make the same kind of movement.<br>
<br>
I had severe trails as I would move my head, but not my eyes. I could move my eyes and everything would be as clear as it was before, but if I moved my entire head or body, everything would bleed into itself, before finally resting at its final form as everything cleared itself up.<br>
<br>
I would breathe, and so would everything else around me. I've read of people saying this about shrooms. It was a strange feeling, like everything was connected to me, and just an extension of myself. Like everything was a single, breathing organism, in my own little world that I could control and manipulate.<br>
<br>
I had such an insane trip that I really can't remember too many details about it. That makes me angry, because I remember how amazed I was at everything, and how much I wanted to just get home and write about what I saw. But it has been a day or two since I did it, and my memory of it has gotten fuzzier and fuzzier. This affects me a lot, because the main thing I wanted to do was write when I was on it. It makes me very sad. I think next time I do acid, I'm going to do it alone, in the comfort of my own home, and just sit there and write.<br>
<br>
My life has changed. I see things in a completely different way than I did before taking acid. I always heard people talk about that, but I had no idea how true it was. I couldn't have asked for a better trip as my first time, because it was more intense than anything I could've hoped for. I would definitely call it a bad trip, but that's a very misleading term. It was the best time I've ever had in my life. Pure insanity. Complete mental overload. Bliss.<!--   End Body   -->

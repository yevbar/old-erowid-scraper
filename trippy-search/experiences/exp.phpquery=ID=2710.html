Well, I had tried nutmeg a few times before this experience, but I hadn't really felt the real power of it until now.  I used preground nutmeg in all of them. The first time I tried to take it down with water but ended up throwing up, so I decided to mix it with something.  So this is what I did:  I got a big bowl of vanilla ice cream and the nutmeg.  I would take a spoonful of ice cream and a spoonful of nutmeg and sprinkle the nutmeg on top of the ice cream.  I did this over a bowl so I could re-use the nutmeg I spilled.  Then I shoved it into my mouth and swished it up. I didn't want to swallow, because it has the texture of sand and will stuck to your throat.  After it was all mixed up and felt like a slush, I swallowed it.  It's not the best tasting stuff but it's not  _the end of the world_ bad. :)<BR>
<BR>
It took me half an hour to eat it and I started eating at around 3:30 pm.  I had to go to my neighbor's wedding this particular night so I had to get ready.  Even as I'm writing this I am having trouble remembering what I did next.  At 7:00 pm when the wedding started I remember nothing much going on. My eyes felt weird and everything was kinda blurry.  Nothing mental, yet.  During the wedding ceremony I was feeling really out of it.  Every now and then we would stop to pray and the second I closed my eyes I was gone to another reality, where I felt I could just sit there with my head down forever.  Also, when I closed my eyes and listened everything felt...around me.  I could best describe it by having you close your eyes and don't see anything.  Just listen.  Then when the sense of sight loses all meaning to you...you'll get it. :)<BR>
<BR>
Well, after the ceremony we went to the reception to eat.  We had to walk down a hallway to get there and I was having MAJOR trouble walking.  The walk felt like a huge transcontinental journey that took forever.  I was quite happy and giggling a lot at the time.  After we sat down, I got a glass of water because my mouth was feeling _very_ dry.  I repeatedly got water the rest of the night.  Also, the cake I tried to eat was horrid. 'Tried to eat' because I couldn't swallow it.  It would just gum up in my mouth and sit there. Everything else from the night is very surreal. I thought I was peaking then, but later discovered I was wrong.  Also, my sister mentioned that I tilted my head back and stared at the ceiling for like 5 minutes during this time, though I don't remember any of it.<BR>
<BR>
We came home at around 10:30 pm.  I listened to the radio for a while, which didn't produce any really weird stuff.  Then a little later, when I took off my headphones I heard something...a hiss.... It was everywhere - no matter where I turned it was always in the same spot.  I realised it was from the headphones and decided that that was pretty dang cool. :)  After lying down and listening to the radio some more, I started peaking.  Something I noticed is that I remember hearing things, but I don't remember seeing them.  Weird.  <BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I was getting kinda fed up with this whole thing because I was very tired and wanted to sleep, but it was impossible because I would make these involuntary movements to the music.  I'm going to explain this the best I can. My body parts had little levers attached to them with balls at the end. Imagine a stick with a ball at the end.  These sticks went through a black wall above me and the balls were visible over my body.  When my body parts would move, like my feet, the lever above my feet would move, too.  I started moving this way on purpose in the beginning, but it got out of control.  I would think about moving a little every beat, and my body would take over and start herky-jerky fashion uncontrollably moving.  It was quite fun for a little while but then it started to grind on me.  After that I got up and went to the bathroom.  What I found was that while I wasn't listening to the music anymore, I was still moving like that.  Gah, this  sucks.  I walked that way, I moved that way.  I probably would have talked that way if someone would have said something to me.  It was pathetic.<BR>
<BR>
I managed to get to sleep, though I don't remember how.  The next day is like a giant smudge.  I got up and I went to bed.  I remember almost nothing about this day. Well, I remember having trouble walking and thinking, and I remember making 2 servings of lunch.  I should note that during this whole time I was having bad, sharp stomach pains that would come and go.  My mouth was dry, also.  Next time I want to leave reality and not remember it, I'll take nutmeg. :)<!--   End Body   -->

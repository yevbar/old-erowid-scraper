I received a telephone call from a friend of mine who was coming into town, wherein he said he had low-grade opium.  Needless to say, after having smoked very potent and pure opium several times before, and getting incredibly high, I was very excited.  He brought over 2 grams, and I bought 1 for $25, and another for a friend.  I examined it, and although it was much drier and crumbly than the other stuff I'd had, it had a similar color, and no conspicuous odor (unburnt).  He informed me that it was called 'Red Rock' opium, which I'd hear of before, but didn't know anything about.  <br>
<br>
I broke it up, mixed it with tobacco, and proceeded to take about 30-40 deep, sustained inhalations from a glass pipe.  I remember thinking and saying several times that it smelled like incense.  At that point, I thought I was a little buzzed.  In retrospect, it was probably more the pot resin from my pipe, although I definitely felt a bit of a head rush.  I proceeded to another friends house, where I took a lot more, along with a little nitrous, alcohol, and cocaine.  I was convinced that I was a bit high on opium, and it was just very low-grade.  I drove back home, decided to do some research about opium on the net, and arrived at the Erowid opiates page.  <br>
<br>
You can imagine my shock and extreme anger at discovering a page entirely dedicated to proving that the so called 'Red-Rock opium' is nothing more than incense.  At this point I realized that I probably placebo-fooled myself into really believing I was high, and if I hadn't read that section, I'd probably still think I was.  Do not buy Red Rock opium, you might as well smoke nutmeg and banana peels.  :(<!--   End Body   -->

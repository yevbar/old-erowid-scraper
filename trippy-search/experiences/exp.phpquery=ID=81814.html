During the summer of 2008 I heard of an experience from one of my friends. She was at the boomtown fair and told me of a substance called monkey dust, which she bought for Â£10 a hit. She explained that it was extremely euphoric better than any other upper she had tried. I searched far and wide to discover the identity of this drug, but the only references I could find for Monkey Dust were a street term for PCP. Since the effects my friend described did not sound anything like PCP I ruled this out and eventually gave up and thought no more of the drug.<br>
<br>
I am not a hugely frequent user of hard-drugs, but I do take a few weekends of every year to have a fucking party. When I'm partying anything goes except the big three - Heroin, Crack and Salvia. I am also fascinated by new things and am by nature very experimental.<br>
<br>
A year later I was on my way to one such party in France to partake in a weekend of fine music played out of a whopping 160kw link-up (also known as french-tek). The people I was travelling with had mentioned that some-one had some of the fabled Monkey Dust, but I waited for it to come my way rather than seek it out.<br>
<br>
It was the Sunday mid afternoon of the party and everyone was packing up, as it was rumoured that the Genderme and miltitary would move in to dislodge us. Before we moved out one of the boys came into the van and announced that he was going to snort the rest of his monkey dust before we left to minimise the amount of drugs he had on him. He offered everyone a line but no-one accepted except me and one of my girl-friends. It was at this point that I was informed of the true name of the chemical - MDPV. I had never seen or heard of this chemical, it was light brown in colour and clung together slightly, I was suspicious that it was heroin but was assured otherwise. Having never heard of this chemical I had no idea of dosage so I left that to the guy who owned it, I believe what I took was a relatively high dose the line looked to be about 20-30mgs anyway I sank it and waited for the effects.<br>
<br>
After about half an hour I felt a light rush similar to good coke, but a little more peaceful. I felt quite happy taking part in conversation and yet didn't talk gibberish, it was very subtle. Empathy came next and loads of it, I felt like hugging everyone much like MDMA but with no twitches or flutters or muscle tension. These effects carried on for about half an hour and seemed to be getting stronger, but I never felt like I lost control I was loved up but felt quite happy to keep this to my self whereas had I been on MDMA I would have been giving people massages and taking off my clothes.<br>
<br>
My girlfriend rang me at this point and I had a great conversation with her. (My girlfriend doesn't take drugs, smoke and drinks about four times a year. But she has no problem with my personal choices) I found conversation came easily and I felt like I loved her more than ever. I was on the phone to her for about fifteen minutes, when I came off the phone and went back to everyone we continued chatting and laughing for a while. Then came the comedown.<br>
<br>
The comedown on MDPV was horrific for me, it was preceded by that horrible empty feeling in my stomach that 'actually everything is not as amazing as it was ten minutes ago, balls!' this continued for the rest of the day, we drove around and I was very quiet for the remainder of the day. We binged on Ketamine that night in the hotel we stayed in and I was unable to have fun I just wanted to go to sleep and wallow in my misery. But I found myself completely unable to sleep, I must have got three hours that night.<br>
<br>
The next day I felt tired but OK. MDPV in my opinion is a highly addictive drug, the comedown is so horrific and the stuff is relatively cheap considering how little I had to take to get off. I'm just glad I hadn't discovered it at the start of the weekend or I may have had to recover from 300mgs instead of 30.<!--   End Body   -->

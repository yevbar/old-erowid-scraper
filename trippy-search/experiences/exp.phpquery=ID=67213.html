I normally suffer from chronic fatigue. I'm always tired and struggle to stay awake especially in class. I have had numerous tests done and all came back saying that physically, I am above average. The two things I haven't checked out were sleep apnea and depression. The former I'm scheduled to get tested for soon; The latter I don't plan to risk putting on on my permanent medical record. <br>
<br>
I found out Adrafinil was unscheduled and began looking for a way to import it. I found a site located in the UK, but at $40 for 40x300mg tabs, it wasn't affordable for me to use daily. I bit. I figured I can get a legitimate Modafinil prescription if it was worth it.<br>
<br>
A week later, a box came in the mail. Round white tablets looked like the pictures online but had no inscription on them. Box and information pamphlet were in English and French. Brand 'Olmifon.' <br>
<br>
Chased 1 (300mg) tablet down with OJ on an empty stomach and sat to watch a movie. At the time I was feeling tired and irritable. I don't know when the effects began exactly - I'd guess 40-60min. It was subtle, but definitely not placebo. I became awake and less irritable; More social with an overall elevation in mood. No noticeable improvement in attention or memory. I wouldn't compare it to caffeine. Caffeine makes me delusional, paranoid and restless. Adrafinil is more gentle. It just lulls away the struggle to keep my eyes open. <br>
<br>
After about two hours I began having a headache. It might have been due to being hungry but this is not usual of me, so I attribute that to this drug. But it wasn't a terrible headache and an Advil would have lifted it. The effects lasted 3-4 hours. After which I feel the same way I did before taking it (tired in my case). It doesn't hinder night sleep if taken early in the day. <br>
<br>
It doesn't seem to have any recreational value, but works great for staying awake for prolonged periods. I keep some in my car and some at home.<!--   End Body   -->

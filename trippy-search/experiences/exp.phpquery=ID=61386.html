So anyways I’ve been drinking yerba mate since about September 06 with a few breaks in between.<br>
<br>
Basically this weekend was Daylight Savings time and I couldn't get to sleep till like 12. I thought 'Hey why not get some ready for tomorrow'. I got a thermos and some Yerba Mate that I bought from Argentina about 2 weeks ago.<br>
<br>
I only drank half which is about 1/4th of what I usually drink (it tasted like shit for some reason).<br>
<br>
The below summarizes my experience.<br>
<br>
6:30 A.M. - Downed the mate<br>
<br>
6:55 A.M. - Music on ipod sounds mildly different(placebo?)<br>
<br>
8:00 A.M. - Movie in English effects me a bit more emotionally than usual.<br>
<br>
8:50 A.M. - Walked into Media Arts, my friend was putting files into different folders on the computer. This cracked me up extremely I was laughing for the entire duration of when he was doing it. About 3-6 minutes. I would say this was the peak but I could be wrong.<br>
<br>
10:45 A.M. - Effects mellowed out until now. I went to drop a plastic ball into a test tube and as soon as I put it near the rim of the tube I cracked up completely, felt floaty, legs tense, arms tense, bent over a little as my stomach tensed cause of laughter.<br>
<br>
10:50 A.M. - Attempt to put a second ball into the test tube and held back a milder giddiness and did it. Reflexes have been heightened I got the drop rate of the ball almost perfectly at 1.45 seconds.<br>
<br>
11:05 A.M. - Just finished walking to class, my legs felt like jelly they were very lazy, although I felt like I could move I had no will to so my legs slumped.<br>
<br>
12:00 A.M. - Looked over at my friends face and started laughing, more mild then last 2 times.<br>
<br>
That’s basically it, I did feel a bit of a crash and got extremely frustrated. Besides that I would say that it was an awesome experience.<!--   End Body   -->

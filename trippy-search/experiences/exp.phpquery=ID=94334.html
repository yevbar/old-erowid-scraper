I wouldn't call myself a big drug taker. I have experimented, I smoke a fair bit of weed but harder drugs such as coke and things have never really interested me that much. Hallucinogens, however are a different story. I'm a very sceptical person, it's always amazed me the thought of taking a drug and it changing my perception and view of the world, it was this amazement that led me to temptation. I came home from university one day and my housemates had some friends from home and they were trying this new drug they had got off the internet, called AMT. They asked if I had wanted some and at first I had said no, they had already taken it and were egging me on to 'join them.' Normally, I would have said no, I don't go into things like that lightly, but for some reason (which I can't fully remember for the life of me now) I had had a real crappy day that day. And basically something inside of me said “fuck it.”<br>
<br>
I took the bomb and swallowed it and waited for the effects. This was really the first thing of it's kind that I had done so I was quite naive to the whole thing. In fact I think that worked in my favour because I didn't worry about it. My friends had told me that it makes you vomit first, but then once you vomit the trip begins.<br>
<br>
After about half an hour I started to feel a little ill, but no vomit and no effects of the drug. Then feeling ill I went to the toilet to see if I was sick. 10 minutes in the toilet and nothing, then I sort of felt something inside of me, I remember saying to myself “come on then, lets have you” and with that I vomited. As my friends had said instantly it kicked in. I remember looking at the door of the bathroom, it was solid wood and I could see the grain of the wood flowing, like an ocean. I looked at my palm of my hand and could see all the lines on my palm moving and flowing in the same way. I wasn't worried, I loved it. I knew that they weren't actually moving, but hell try telling my brain that. <br>
<br>
However, I was coming up fairly slowly, and at this point the other three I was with who were about 30 minutes to and hour further into the trip than decided they wanted to go to the supermarket, I didn't want to leave the house in my state so decided to stay on my own and watch a t.v. I don't know how long they were gone, they claim it took them hours to walk to, shop and walk back from the supermarket. But while they were gone I just took repeated hits on the laughing gas we had and watched a movie. I remember coming up some more doing the gas and 'send me on my way' by rusted root came on the telly, I took some gas and felt the AMT, to this day that remains one of my favourite songs, it was just such a cool and mellow beat. I loved it. <br>
<br>
Up to now this trip had been quite tame, a few visual and a buzzing feeling, but when my friends got back that's when things started getting trippy. They had come back with the balloons with lights in them, these things were awesome, we had one each, a different colour each and once we started doing the gas in these balloons in the dark we knew we were onto something, we blocked out every single source of light we could find in the room and we did these balloons, I remember leaning back on the sofa and as I breathed in and out of the balloon all of the different colours left the balloons and I could see them spread out all across the roof, it was like I was watching the northern lights on my very own front room ceiling. <br>
<br>
Next after blocking out the light we blocked out reality, we made our own reality. Phones or any other such objects were 'reality punches', they reminded us of the real world. We didn't want that, we wanted to be in our own reality. We wanted to lose ourselves. We took on the personality of our balloons, I was blue, my friends red, green and yellow. Blue became my friend (I might add the balloons had faces on them) Blue became my guide in the trip, nothing could go wrong as long as he was there. It was like being on Acid but nothing could go wrong, I saw a devil on the roof at one point but it didn't bother me. If anything it just made me laugh. Nothing could fase me. I became so close with the people I was with. We coined it 'an intense sense of belonging' with one another. I became like brothers with these people (my flatmate's friends) I had only met a few hours ago.<br>
I don't know how long we were there for but it was hours and hours. But we completely lost sense of time, it didn't matter to us. Time was something of reality, we were in out own reality. It was cut short with other housemates arriving home early (opening the door and letting the light in was a huge 'reality punch') and because green (my housemate's friend) had started to take a bad trip. He was freaking out quite badly and I didn't really know what to do so I left the situation and hung out upstairs with my sober friend. It was a bit of a downer, and I struggled to sleep for a while because I could still feel it in my body.<br>
<br>
But it was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had. I know I haven't explained properly, and haven't explained half the stuff I experienced but it really felt like I had travelled into another universe. I am still friends with the guys today, and still refer to one of them (red) as exactly that 'red' and he still calls me 'blue'.<br>
<br>
It wasn't like mushrooms which I have since tried, because the upper side of the drug means I dont care about anything. I don't worry about the effects I just go with it. It is the only time I have taken it, I worry about taking it again and it simply wont be as good, I think I'd rather keep that experience. But from the people I know who have taken it again they tell me it is a different trip everytime. <br>

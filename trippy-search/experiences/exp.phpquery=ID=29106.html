I had a huge paper due in the morning, so at around 5:00 PM, I called my friend and bought one 20mg Adderall pill from him.  Like every other college student, I had heard all about how Adderall aids in school work.  I have experience with the usual drugs: alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, painkillers, shrooms, LSD and have even dabbled in cocaine a few times, but I had never taken Adderall.<BR>
<BR>
At around 6:00 PM I swallowed the little pinkish orange pill on an empty stomach.  Perhaps it was placebo, but in about 30 minutes I felt a bit light-headed.  My field of vision seemed to broaden a bit, and I felt a slight increase in energy.  With this new found buzz of energy, and an expectation of what was to come, I began searching for quotes for my paper.<BR>
<BR>
I soon began typing my paper, and I noted that sentences just flowed right out of my head and into the paper.  Ideas and thoughts just seemed to come to me easier and faster than usual.<BR>
<BR>
I really began to feel the Adderall at around 7:30, T + 1:30 from when I had first dosed.  My vision was a little shaky, my hands were sweating and I could feel my heart beating faster and harder than usual.  At this point, I had a fairly good body buzz and just a general sense of euphoria.  It wasn't anything too intense, but the feeling was defiantly there.  I guess I would compare it to a mild dose of coke... only a little less 'pure' feeling, and without the numbing qualities (and naturally much longer lasting).<BR>
<BR>
During the next 3 hours I was absolutely railed onto my paper.  I would describe it as almost a meditative state, in the fact that I didn't notice, or care about anything other than the computer screen in front of me.  This is coming from a guy who usually procrastinates for hours and has a hard time concentrating on school work for more than a few minutes at a time.  (Yah, I think I have a little ADD--but don't we all?)  <BR>
<BR>
I couldn't think about ANYTHING else.  I became obsessed with making my paper perfect.  I was delighted to find all sorts of connections, parallels, and quotes that I probably would not have been able to put into my paper if it hadn't been for the Adderall.<BR>
<BR>
The one time that I had to leave my desk, I remember feeling SUPER pissed about momentarily stopping work on my paper.  I’m usually more than happy to take nice relaxing breaks from school work, but not this time!  The whole time I was away from my desk, I was thinking about my paper, my baby.  I was actually happy to resume work on it!<BR>
<BR>
I finished the bulk of my paper around 10:30.  By this time, I noted a decrease in the intensity of the effects.  My vision was normal, my heartbeat had subsided a bit, and the body buzz was almost completely gone.  My hands were still pretty sweaty though.  I could still feel the speedy effects at work in my brain, and I was still thinking about my paper, although not quite as intensely as before.  <BR>
<BR>
Slowly, I could feel the Adderall leave my body, and by around midnight, T+ 6:00, I felt just about back to baseline.  I noticed a slight depression from the come-down, but it was nothing too bad.  My friend had warned me that it could make it hard to sleep, so at around 1:00 AM, I took a couple Benedryl pills, to aid in getting some sleep.  I fell asleep just fine, woke up the next day feeling fine, no hangover, no bad effects.<BR>
<BR>
There is no doubt that Adderall helped me get a paper done that probably would not have been done otherwise.  Adderall helped me get into 'the zone' on something that would otherwise be mind-blowiwngly boring.<!--   End Body   -->

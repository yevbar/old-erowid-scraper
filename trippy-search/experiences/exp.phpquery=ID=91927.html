A free house means a party! <br>
<br>
Day 1- My friend (who I call K) and I do allergy tests with the methoxetamine (MXE) 2 hours prior to the start of my house party. We're not allergic, so insufflate 10mg (+0.00) each just before people begin to arrive. I was a bit apprehensive since I had never tried a dissociative drug before. 20 minutes passed until I could feel a slight dizziness in my head, that similar to a couple of drinks. As friends began to arrive I realised how strong this chemical was, I was really enjoying it, much more than alcohol, it is extremely floaty. About an hour had passed but it felt like a lot longer, even though time felt like it was flying by. I had heard that dissociatives were supposed to disconnect your body from your mind, but I was very much still in my body, so decided to insufflate another 10mg (+1.30). I was thoroughly enjoying this new experience.<br>
<br>
(+3.00) The effects were wearing off at this point so me and the friends at my house decided to go for a walk to meet more friends to bring back to my house. Despite the walk usually taking about 15 minutes it took 30 and seemed to take even longer but I was still enjoying every second of it. On the way back to my house, me and my friend K smoked a joint and realised that it brought back the effects of the MXE.<br>
<br>
(+4.00) The effects were almost fully gone by this point so me and K decided to re-dose. 25mg were insufflated by each of us at this point. <br>
<br>
15 minutes passed and already I could tell that this was a stronger dosage. My house was full of people at this point but even more people kept turning up, my friend rang me and it took me a good 10 seconds to figure out what the vibrating I could feel was. My friend wanted me to go meet her because she couldn't find my house. I walked from my house to the end of my road which took a minute but it seemed like 10, the MXE was building up and getting stronger, I walked along the side of the park which took 10 minutes but seemed like an indescribable amount of time, during this time I perplexed the wonders of the universe, and since I'm a rather philosofical thinker anyway, I began to ask myself questions about existence and the universe, but instead of thinking of an answer, I believed I was becoming closer to the universe and its contents. I felt as though I was being filled with knowledge. I believe this drug has quite a different feeling depending on setting. I began to find it harder to function, for example unlocking my door when I returned home but it wasn't frustrating in any way.<br>
<br>
(+5.00) The party had well and truly started and I decided to have another joint to enhance the effects of the MXE. I seemed to be floating about my house even though in reality I was most likely bashing into everything in my way, it was an extremely odd but amazing feeling. I remember distinctly putting my hand down on the table and thinking that it wasn't actually my hand, it seemed to not be holding me up but pushing me away.<br>
<br>
(+6.00) 15mg more insufflated, this seemed to just keep me at the same level as the previous dose it just made it last longer.<br>
<br>
(+7.00) My friend (14 stone) who is a lot heavier than me, challenged me to a wrestling match in my living room. I happily accepted thinking it would be a nice friendly fight. '3, 2, 1, FIGHT!' I was thrown straight to the floor, but using the little grappling skill I have, I managed to get him in a sleeper hold and he was about to pass out so I released him slightly, he stood up with me hanging onto his back, he then spun me round and body slammed me. Despite the numbing from the MXE, it felt as though my spine had snapped multiple times. (It felt a lot worse the next day) Even though I was in agony, I seemed to quickly forget about it and began dancing around the room, I even attempted the worm and then realised I couldn't even do that sober.<br>
<br>
(+8.00) Everyone began to fall asleep, and some people left. Me and a friend watched the start of a movie while laying in bed and fell asleep halfway through.<br>
<br>
Day 2-<br>
Woke up feeling rather fresh after only 3 hours sleep, didn't seem to have much of a comedown or hangover, I was just annoyed at how trashed my house was. Broken banister, smashed stained glass window, broken door and rubbish everywhere. I managed to fix and clean everything within an hour before everyone woke up. My house was spotless!<br>
<br>
Cleared everyone out of my house<br>
<br>
Relaxed most of the day and slept for a couple of hours.<br>
<br>
(+0.00) 20mg insufflated with my friend K<br>
Cooked some food, layed in the sun with music, it didn't seem to affect me as much as the previous night. Took a walk to town, met a couple of friends on the way there, they invited us back to their house for a small gathering.<br>
<br>
(+2.00) Arrived at the house, bought a bag of weed, decided I wanted a bong! Went outside with my friend K and a friend called Izzy, I took one breath from the bong and suddenly I lost all sense of consciousness, even though I appeared to be conscious to my friends, I believe I was in an extreme level of subconscious hallucination. <br>
<br>
This is what I believe to have happened between inhaling and exhaling: <br>
A blanket of darkness had descended upon me, engulfed my entire body, carried me through a vortex of thoughts and taken me back to when I was five years old. I could see myself from above as though I was five years old again, my friends K and Izzy were also versions of me throughout my lifetime, and there was a fourth ghostly figure standing below my vision who appeared to be me in the future. I was stuck in a loop, what seemed like a wormhole as such, it felt like it was never going to end, I tried my hardest to mentally awaken myself to my surroundings, I was aware I was only hallucinating but slowly began to question whether I had even taken a drug to begin with or whether life itself was folding in on me from end to beginning and I wasn't at any point in time in particular. I began to wonder 'Is this what dying is? Becoming one with the universe?' <br>
<br>
I then gained consciousness for a moment, and realised I was still holding the bong... I handed the bong to my friend and wondered how long he had been standing there for. He looked at me and asked if I was okay, I asked how long had passed, but since smoke came out of my mouth I guessed not long. When I was speaking I'm not actually sure words were coming out clearly, if coming out at all. I tried to ask for water, I layed down on the kitchen floor, made the mistake of closing my eyes, I fell deeper into this wormhole, looping round looking for an answer to the universe, its existence and my own. Despite not enjoying this experience, I loved feeling this close to knowing all the answers. When I opened my eyes I said 'Wow, that was the longest dream ever' and my friend replied with 'You had your eyes shut for 10 seconds'.<br>
<br>
At this point I believed that my bag of weed was poison so I gave it to K to mind or smoke, I didn't care at this point. I laid on the floor fixated on my phone, texting my friend who didn't know I was on drugs at the time, and I believed she saved my life by pulling me out of the wormhole. I eventually sat up and started talking to some strangers who were at the house, they were interested in my thoughts at this point in time and what had happened to me. K convinced me that I had died and came back to life, it was easter sunday so someone else convinced me I was Jesus. I then stood up suddenly and proclaimed 'I must go spread the word of God!' to which the whole room burst into laughter.<br>
<br>
Overall this was a very interesting experience and I loved it, however I wouldn't put myself through it ever again. I would however try Methoxetamine again, it is a very enjoyable substance, but should be taken with care as it is a very powerful substance! I have taken methoxetamine on 2 more occasions since and it has been extremely enjoyable, I would say that it mixes extremely well with alcohol also.<!--   End Body   -->

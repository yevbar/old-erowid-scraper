After becoming acquainted with Salvia divinorum, I browsed the vaults of erowid extensively. I had several very interesting discussions with a few friends of mine that were knowledgeable on the subject, and resolved that I would like to try the substance.<BR>
<BR>
My friend Z gave me three dried leaves one day. I took them over to C's house where I was spending the night. After sitting around and waiting for everyone else to get off to bed, we spent a few moments clearing our minds to be as careful as possible. It's dangerous to be reckless with hallucinogens.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, Z had suggested a method for cheap vaporization that involved wrapping the leaves in tin foil and holding it over a lightbulb. We spent several minutes trying to get this to work with minimal results (perhaps we should pulverize the leaves in the future?)<BR>
<BR>
Determined to experience the plant, we sought a grill lighter and used it to burn the leaves. After a few tokes (which were very hot and hard to hold in), I felt as if I was on the edge.<BR>
<BR>
I quickly stood up and noticed that the whole world seemed to be moving a bit faster. I felt as if a little more Salvia was all I needed to break through and have an enlightening experience. Thus, I began to rush my friend C to keep burning the substance. He obviously hadn't felt any of the effects as he seemed frustrated and muttered a typical 'hold on!'<BR>
<BR>
Frustrated, we opened the foil to notice that all of the salvia had been burned too slowly. Shortly afterwards, our friend J arrived. J and C went to smoke some weed, during which time I felt unusually paranoid. The Salvia did have a pleasant buzz, but it subsided soon after.<BR>
<BR>
I can only hope that I will get another opportunity in the future with Salvia. I felt its amazing power almost flowing through me, and I can't wait to get it all the way in.<!--   End Body   -->

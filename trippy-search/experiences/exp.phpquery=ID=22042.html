I tried Z for the third time last night and it was pretty funny.  I don't remember my dreams the first time because I took an Ambien to fall asleep.  I drank a tea of about two tablespoons Mugwort flavored with Chamomile and Lavender  for sweet dreams last night.  What seems to be best about Z is that the dreams start right away and last the whole night through, instead of only in the early morning before I wake up.<BR>
<BR>
Last night, I dreamed of a tiny faery-elf that looked just like Winona Ryder -- in dark green silk!  I appeared with Winona-Elf in the back yard of the house I grew up in at the spot where I used to grow food and wildflowers.  In the dream, I realized I was looking at a faery-elf, but I wasn't surprised; I seemed to know her, and she seemed to be one of the people I speak to at night when I dream.  (OK, I'm not sure what that means, but it makes sense somehow.)  She was there with a smaller side-kick who dressed in the same silk, but seemed to be male.  He seemed to be dumb (mute), like he was the spirit of an animal.  (Gee, I am not sure what that means, either.)  I said 'What about the little circles left behind by the elves' dancing bee that everyone sees from time to time?'  Then, she led me to the back patio, the three of us joined hands in a quarter-circle.  A  black cat joined us, and I held her forepaw, too.  <BR>
<BR>
I asked the faery woman to cast a spell on my feet, because I had never danced before.  Then my feet started a little jig, and the four of us -- Faery woman, side-kick, me and the cat -- danced while pretending there were other people with us to close the ring and  form a complete circle.  <BR>
<BR>
Suddenly, the faery woman stopped, looked dismayed, and I awoke into another stage of sleep.  The cat hissed, and I had that frightening feeling that another presence was there.  Then I woke up, with mighty rushing noises in my ears.  <BR>
<BR>
Had Zacatechichi come?<BR>
<BR>
Earlier last night, before the dream of Winona-elf, I dreamed I was hiking around in the mountains of California composing a liturgy for orchestra and organ.  It was coming out really very good and I was so impressed with myself that I could write such a fine piece of music without any formal musical training.  I was sure I must be the smartest guy in the world.<BR>
<BR>
The second night of Z, the night before last, I dreamed I was in my old elementary school (although it looked quite a bit different).  I was un-ME:  that is, I was everything that I am but won't express.  As a kid I was one of the smallest, and never caused anyone any trouble ever.  In this dream, I was eleven and about 5'8'.  My teacher sent me to deliver a message for her.  It was lunch time, and some kids in the hallway from another class were throwing something orange and sticky up against the ceiling to get it to stick, but it wouldn't.  When it fell down, I grabbed it, and one of the kids tried to grab me.  We rough-housed in the hallway.  I was kicking butt.  Another teacher saw us and made us stand against the wall.  I waited until no one was looking and escaped.  I delivered the note for my teacher, and tried to hide.  It didn't work, and the mean teachers were very pissed off that I dared defy them.  <BR>
<BR>
As a little kid,  I was super co-operative and chatty.  Trouble comes anyway.  Un-ME is a well-meaning hell-raiser and communicates through body language.  Much more fun.  I like un-ME.<BR>
<BR>
When I woke up, I heard the rushing noises, and felt warm energy at the soles of my feet and palms of my hands.  My hands felt very heavy, and what was really trippy, they felt like they were growing to four times their size, then like they were shrinking to a fourth their size, over an over again -- growing, shrinking.<BR>
<BR>
Z is fun.<BR>
<BR>
By the way, I took the Z and Mugwort tea at the same time.  Tonight, I won't take any Mugwort.  I want to see how Z does alone.<BR>
<BR>
Zacatechichi.  Zacatechichi.  Zacatechichi.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
By the way, you may wish to know I am kind of a sensitive.  <BR>
-I had visions every few weeks ages 9-12.<BR>
-A cup of coffee will keep me up all night.<BR>
-With cannibis, I see the purple haze everywhere, and golden blobs of energy pulsing up my legs.  Cannibis makes me sure that life is an illusion, that we are just playing a real good video game, but have forgotten the real room we're standing in.  And I tried it but once.<BR>
-I was prescribed Effexor once, and a month thereafter I saw a one-and-a-half foot elf in my bedroom, upside down and naked.  It was total terror for about three seconds until I realized how incredibly cool it was.  The Doctor said I was fine upstairs.<BR>
-With Effexor and Mugwort tea taken together, I found selves of mine which I am living out at the same time in sundry earth-like universes.  This was during the early morning.<BR>
-I never get sick.<BR>
-I like everybody.  Life rules, living bites.<!--   End Body   -->

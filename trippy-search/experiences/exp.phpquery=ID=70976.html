I was only able to find 1 study on this subject.  I can only assume that is because, although the experiment worked in freeing opiate users from addiction, there was a 100% recidivism rate.  It must be mentioned, though, that the sample consisted of 7 people.  <br>
<br>
Now first hand experience.  I have been addicted to opiates on and off for about 4 years now.  I usually use poppy tea because i can afford it and it's dependable, but sometimes i'll sniff dope or oxy for a treat.  I had used suboxone (buprenorphine) to go clean for my longest period of abstinence, about a year. <br>
<br>
Last year I stumbled on to the fact that a dose of GBL can completely eliminate all symptoms of opiate withdrawal.  People should know this.  there are a few catches, I must admit.  For 1, you must redose every 4 hours.  Waking up in the middle of the night sweating through my matress sucks, yes, but dropping some G clears up all those effects in about 5 minutes.  It truly is a miracle!<br>
<br>
Now I have to say that I, myself, usually alternate Tea and GBL.  Two weeks of Tea and one of GBL.  Therefore I suppose I am a recivist, but that does not change the relief, whether for 4 hours or a week, is priceless, it keeps tolerance low, and GBL is a safety net if kept on hand.  If i put my mind to it, desired it enough, and planned properly, I am confident that I could use this method to quit.  Perhaps I'd come off the GBL with benzos for a few days and then I'd be done.  But with a brain constantly addled by so much candy, everyday for over ten years, I have to say that drugs enhance me.  I perform better at almost everything as long as the appropriate drug is put to use.  But now I am constantly on drugs.  I do wonder if there is a way out, and if I want to take it, not this evening though.<br>
<br>
All in all, I just feel people, including the medical community, should be aware that an addict can be freed of thier misery and suffering with dose of a different drug.  Because GBL is non-opiate, at the end of a week there are no more WD symptoms. But lastly, be careful.  The consequences of irresponsible GBL use can be rather extreme.  Don't go into anything without the weapon of information.<!--   End Body   -->

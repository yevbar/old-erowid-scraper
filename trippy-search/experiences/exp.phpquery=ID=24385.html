It wasn't wise of me to drink alcohol before doing the rest of this, but I counteracted the impending dehydration with lots of gatorade before the IM injection of K.<BR>
<BR>
While dancing at the club with my boys J and K, we picked up some GHB and some pills of MDMA.  J and I each took one cap of GHB liquid and then left the club.  On the way to J's, things were getting pretty interesting.  The G kicked in within 5 minutes and made me feel a bit nauseated b/c of the beers I drank.  I felt very sexually aroused while leaving the club and all the girls looked amazing.  On the ride home, we all pounded a quart of gatorade. <BR>
<BR>
Just before we got to J's, all three of us ingested one tablet of MDMA.  It began working very well alongside the G within ~30 minutes.  We changed into more comfortable clothing and chilled out.  There were other people partying at J's house, and most of them were experienced adventurers.  K and I smoked a joint of some pretty dank shit to relax (or to enhance) the voyage.  At this point, we were feeling pretty wild.  The G was sending vibrations down my back that made my teeth chatter.  The MDMA was causing waves of tactile bliss to roll up and down my body.  My field of vision was very shaky and very very blurry.  It would have been psychotic to drive in this condition.  Now here's where it gets good:<BR>
<BR>
J and I set up blankets and pillows on the floor of his home studio room.  We hooked up 2 pairs of headphones to his mixer and threw a mix of some trance on.  Side comment: I love jungle and can't stand how cheesy trance can be, but J had some pretty deep and epic shit playing.  It made me realize how powerful that music can be in the right state of mind (but I wont listen to it otherwise).  We had two bottles of Ketacet III liquid and fresh darts that are intended for insulin use.  J loaded the darts up directly from the bottles.  I gave K some on a plate so that he could microwave it into powder for insufflation.  He wanted to just hang out and enjoy his roll and the company.<BR>
<BR>
J and I closed the door to his studio.  Being the older and more experienced of the two of us, J took 100ml IM, and I took 50ml IM.  We made sure to have a trash can nearby in case of vomiting.  We each swallowed one more cap of GHB and then lay down and strapped on the headphones in total darkness.  Keep in mind that we were already experiencing lots of body pleasure from the G and E.<BR>
<BR>
Within 5 minutes, I had slowly drifted into my head and the music started to pound out some haunting melodies.  I felt my limbs go numb and the dissociation began.  The size of my limbs felt greatly distorted.  It was hard to tell where my extremities really were.  All the visuals I will desribe are all ClosedEyeVisuals (CEV's).  J told me not to fight it before we went deep.  He was very experienced and thus had figured out an almost perfect way to use this potent cocktail.  I took his advice and stopped trying to keep my body sensations in order.  After ~10 minutes, I was in deep meditation and was experiencing total synesthesia.  I no longer had any body so to speak.  My entire consciousness was a single floating point that evolved as my mind wandered.  <BR>
<BR>
I found myself flying through almost tangible worlds of dark green and red hues.  When indoors in the worlds, it was like being in a really dark and swanky club.  I floated past infinite rows of bottles on shelves in impossible hallways.  Outdoors, the night sky was deeper than pitch black.  I jumped and flew over different geometric white, concrete slabs.  In this world, nothing made sense.  There was no breathing or hunger or sensation necessary.  I could not tell if I was dead or alive, but I didn't care at all.  The music pushed and pulled at my emotions and I would occasionally dip back into my body for a moment of sensational tactile ecstacy.  It felt like sheets of thin, cold, and soft material were running over my skin...all being handled by a female entity who embodied my most complete sense of sexuality and lust.  <BR>
<BR>
Back in the inner universe, I could now sometimes see my legs below me.  I left the room K and I were in and floated off through mountain canyons and deep jungles.  On the beach past the jungle, I rested to talk to my ex-girlfriend.  It was dark out but her inner radiance was beautiful and light.  She understood that I still loved her deeply even though we had moved apart to pursue our own personal goals.  As was typical with our past experiences, she made sure to tell me to remain positive and to be safe.  I was able to project physical manifestations in intense, multidimensional geometries of profound love, gratitude, and universal sorrow to her.  With a tear in my eye, we parted again.  I knew that there were higher things to accomplish in my travel.  <BR>
<BR>
It went on like this for maybe an hour.  The music was a key element of my experience.  It painted color and shape into my being, and also made my occasional body writhe in bliss.  J and I sat up almost simultaneously after the music stopped.  There was an ultraviolet lamp in his room and we looked over and started laughing hysterically.  I felt so touched by the experience that I began to silently cry tears of joy.  Nothing had ever been so strange, mystifying, or wonderful in all of my travels.  I was still right plastered.  We stumbled out to join the other people who were getting lit on their own.  We later insufflated a few small lines to boost the buzz.  Walking was difficult and I felt as though the rooms of J's house were incredibly small and short.  Throughout the night, I injected 50ml Ketacet IM two more times.  Each with amazing effects, although none so moving as the first.  I think this was due to the fact that all the drugs in my body were peaking simultaneously the first time.<BR>
<BR>
The next day, I felt kind of groggy and disoriented physically.  It had been a long night. However, my outlook was so positive and continues to be so, even months down the road.<BR>
<BR>
I tried to tell K about what I had seen, but also realized that the experience was a deep, intrapersonal voyage through my mind and my life.  I knew that I was a good person and that everything was going to be okay in the end b/c I had already been beyond death.  I have no worries about judgement in the afterlife.the universe is just a constant exchange of matter and energy. I'm amazed that I can have the experience to be a human, if only for a short while.  Perhaps I'll have it again someday.<!--   End Body   -->

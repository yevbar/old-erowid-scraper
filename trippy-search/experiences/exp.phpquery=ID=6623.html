I got a hold of a vial of 10x extract and proceeded to smoke it out of a bong. I took a long hard hit, stood up and walked a few steps away and held the smoke in for over 20 seconds. Within seconds, I could feel its effects on my brain, like a dreamy state. My friend held his hand over the bong to keep the smoke from getting out, giving me a second chance to get the remaining smoke into my lungs. I walked over to the bong with a fat grin on my face (I do remember that) and I tried to hit it again while feeling very disoriented. I immediately coughed out the smoke, it was impossible to hold it in. <BR>
<BR>
I felt a quick rush, and then reality faded out, and I felt as if I left my body. I was suddenly warped in the middle of a circle of people. Some had the face like of my friend, some had no face at all. They didn't have legs or feet, just arms and a body and the odd thing was that they were all connected, (like an accordion). They began to throw and toss me around like a dodgeball. The feeling I got from this was extremely intense. As I was being hurled in the air, the circle of people began to rotate like a wheel. They began going faster and I, too was being thrown faster, which was even more intense.<BR>
 <BR>
I saw a door beyond the circle and I struggled to break free. I made it over top of them and as soon as I opened the door, there was a quick blur and I found myself back in the middle of the circle again. My view faded out again, I felt a powerful jolt and I found myself back in my body again, back in the real world. Even though I was back in my body, I could not control it. I felt as if the world were a big joke and it made me laugh....hard. I felt a benevolent pull of gravity from all directions, it was quite an odd feeling. I tried to sit down and relax, but my body didn't. I ran off into the backyard. It was damn cold that night and I was only wearing a t-shirt, yet the cold weather didn't bother me one bit. I thought, 'what the hell am I doing out here?' so I went back inside. I heard someone playing a game on their computer and I thought it said snoop doggy dog, but I know that I was just hearing things. From the time since I came back to reality, I felt an incredibly exhilarating body high. <BR>
<BR>
This was an incredible experience for me, I highly recommend it but please take it into fact that this is an extremely powerful psychoactive, and don't ever do it alone.<BR>
<BR>
These are the things that my friend saw me do that I was not aware of doing (I don't remember doing them) <BR>
<BR>
-The first thing I did after I became affected was that I grabbed the lamp post and I said  'I am part of the pole'<BR>
-I picked up a piece of aluminum foil and asked, 'what the hell is this??'<BR>
-I sat on top of the sink's counter-top<BR>
-I kept saying, 'they're not real, they're not real'<BR>
-I repeatedly mumbled about 'a game'<BR>
-I tore out a cushion from the couch and threw it to the floor<BR>
-I walked on my hands and knees shouting gibberish and nonsense<!--   End Body   -->

I had never had the pleasure of attending one before, but I never<br>
expected drugs to be sold so openly at music festivals. My journey to<br>
Spookstock 7 was long an uneventful, and mostly was spent mentally<br>
preparing for whatever psychedelic experiences I might have. I was<br>
actually doubtful that I would be able to find any doses at all, as<br>
it's fairly uncommon in my home state. I was not to be disappointed.<br>
<br>
I awoke to the rising sun at about seven o'clock, on the second day of<br>
the festival. I had arrived at the campground at midnight the night<br>
before, to something like an all-night music and drug party, and<br>
hadn't slept much in the intervening time. I was feeling strangely<br>
refreshed anyway, for some reason. I think it was something about the<br>
atmosphere of this place; everyone I met seemed to non-verbally<br>
acknowledge the strange, subtle connectedness that the psychedelic<br>
state awakens me to. It was, perhaps, the change that was refreshing.<br>
Not many people I normally interact with have been awakened in this<br>
way.<br>
<br>
As I climbed out of my friend R's car, stretched, and stumbled around,<br>
I encountered three new arrivals, camped out in the space next to<br>
us. were yelling at passerby, 'Molly!  Mescaline!'. (T-1:00)<br>
'Mescaline', I thought. That was definitely on my long, but<br>
shortening, list of 'Substances To Experience Before I Die'.<br>
<br>
In addition to the connectedness, everyone here is just extremely<br>
friendly, too. Maybe it's all the good pot and beautiful scenery. I<br>
don't know. Anyway, I talked to this 'mescaline' guy for a while, and<br>
he invited me over to his campsite, and offered me some hot chocolate.<br>
He told me that what he actually had was MDMA, Peyote extract, and<br>
2C-B, which he explained was like synthetic mescaline.<br>
<br>
However, I already knew 2C-B well from my research. I had never<br>
experienced it, though. It is indeed chemically similar to mescaline,<br>
but it has its own unique and interesting effects, also. I knew that<br>
it's effects are described as 'Somewhere between MDMA and LSD, but<br>
completely unlike a combination of the two.' He agreed to sell me one<br>
of his few doses. I took it on the spot, and proceeded up the hill to<br>
the site where people had been gathered around the bonfire the night<br>
before. I knew there would be a good aura up there. (T0:00)<br>
<br>
As a bit of background information, I've been having a mild identity<br>
crisis over the past few months. A lot of my friendships had changed<br>
suddenly, and I found myself more alone than I'd ever been. I realized<br>
at this point that I had been defining myself too much by the people I<br>
was associating with, and, in the absence of them, I wasn't entirely<br>
sure who I was, where I was, or even why I was alive. It was very<br>
disconcerting, to say the least. <br>
<br>
The embers of the bonfire of the night before were still smoldering<br>
when I arrived, and about ten of my fellow early morning trippers had<br>
been drawn up here as well. They were all sitting around it, smiling,<br>
sometimes talking sporadically, but mostly just relaxing and being<br>
generally amicable towards the world. I'd never met any of these<br>
people before, but the seemed friendly enough.<br>
<br>
A kid in glasses and an all-over print t-shirt welcomed me over. This<br>
was the first time I'd seen the camp in the daytime, and I must say,<br>
it is beautiful beyond description. It was a perfect day. Clear, blue<br>
sky with a warm sun beating down its pure energy onto us. The<br>
greenest, softest grass I'd ever seen encircled the fire like a<br>
carpet, stretching away into the woods at the bottom of the<br>
hill. Birds were flying in an unbelievable dance of life far above us,<br>
as the fire crackled in what I thought was a wise and especially<br>
soothing manner. I was definitely beginning to feel the effects of the<br>
drug now. (T+0:30-0:40)<br>
<br>
All of my previous trips have been with tryptamine compounds, and what<br>
I found is that, if 2C-B is any indication, phenethylamines are much<br>
more pleasant. Much warmer, much friendlier, less 'glitchy', and with<br>
less distracting visual activity. That's not to say the visual<br>
activity is not there. If anything, it was much more intense than with<br>
other drugs I've tried. However, I was able to ignore it much more<br>
easily. It wasn't as mesmerizing as what I would see on, for<br>
example, LSD. This was a good thing, as it lets me focus more on my<br>
soul, which is what I came here to do.<br>
<br>
When it finally arrived, after maybe 45 minutes, The come-up was fast<br>
and fairly intense; almost overwhelming. I felt the energy of it<br>
washing over me in waves, and it felt amazing. If I had been in a more<br>
neutral or hostile setting, things probably would have been<br>
frightening at this point, but I knew that everyone around me<br>
understood, and was supportive of my state of mind. This made it much<br>
easier to bare my soul, and slip into a pleasant state of openness and<br>
unity with my surroundings. (T+0:40-1:00)<br>
<br>
Before I had been there thirty minutes, the kid in the glasses and an<br>
old hippie got together with a guitar and a drum, and started playing<br>
music. It started off rough, and before long the kid admitted that he<br>
was 'too fucked up on mushrooms' to be playing guitar well. Everyone<br>
laughed in that kind of spaced-out way, they switched instruments, and<br>
then proceeded to play the most beautiful music I've ever heard. The<br>
trees swayed, the wind blew, the birds swooped and dove in intricate<br>
patterns, and it seemed as though the whole valley was dancing to the<br>
beat of our collective soul.<br>
<br>
Colors ... are amazing. Acid never did the colors thing for me, but on<br>
this ... the grass was the greenest green I have ever seen. I'll never<br>
forget it, as long as I'm alive. The world is a beautiful place, if<br>
only you can eliminate your bias and stop filtering the beauty through<br>
your worldview for a moment. I am in love with this place.<br>
<br>
The birds ... its almost as if they act as a single organism, some<br>
kind of a pseudo-hive mind. Every one of them has a soul, but,<br>
together, they are something greater. Something ... beyond ... mere<br>
birds. They are a collective. WE are a collective. We are at peace.<br>
<br>
It was quickly apparent that 2C-B is also much more of an intoxicant<br>
than LSD is, at least for me. My memory was dramatically affected, and<br>
somehow in-sync with the waves of energy crashing over my<br>
consciousness. The rest of the trip was superimposed upon sets of<br>
clearly-defined waves of beauty, awareness, and clarity. It was as if<br>
I was in a movie, and, at points, I would suddenly 'awaken' in a new<br>
place, as if a cutscene or transition had taken place. I was fully<br>
sane, conscious, and aware in the intervening time, and I remember it<br>
clearly, but it's not nearly as important as when I was on the crest<br>
of a wave of energy. Its as if I was coming to orgasmic revelations,<br>
every twenty minutes or so.<br>
<br>
I remember clearly, at the peak of my come-up, two older clean-shaven<br>
men came over and sat down around the campfire with us. For some<br>
reason, it was obvious to me that they were undercover cops. Looking<br>
back, I'm not sure if they actually were. However, a man in camoflogue<br>
came over to the campfire, talking in a walkie-talkie, convincing me<br>
beyond a doubt that we were surrounded by some kind of undercover SWAT<br>
team. <br>
<br>
He reached down behind a log where a kid was sitting, and picked up a<br>
bag of weed. 'What's this?'  he said. 'Will you please stand up, sir?'<br>
I was sure that we were getting busted, and was really high at this<br>
point, so it was kind of starting to freak me out. But, it turns out,<br>
the guy was just selling weed. 'Crappy weed is what it is. Nugget<br>
delivery service!' he said. 'Somebody buy some nuggets!' I didn't see<br>
or hear about anyone get arrested during the entire festival. The guys<br>
that I suspected were cops even smoked some of the pot with us. (T+1:30)<br>
<br>
As I started to come down from the crest of my first wave, I wandered<br>
away from the campfire, and walked down 'Shakedown Street', the place<br>
where all the vendors are set up. Everyone's face was severely<br>
distorted, but not in a menacing way. It was an obvious drug effect,<br>
so it didn't cause me much worry. The people didn't seem to notice<br>
that I was tripping, or just simply didn't care. I felt a strange<br>
benevolence towards everyone, tinged with a hint of suspisciousness,<br>
as I still suspected there were more undercover cops around here,<br>
somewhere. I didn't have anything on me, so it wasn't a fear, but<br>
rather an understandable delusion that I held for twenty minutes or<br>
so. There probably were cops around there, with all the drug<br>
trafficking going on. However, I recognized it as a drug-induced<br>
delusion, and brushed it off before I left Shakedown.<br>
<br>
Eventually, I ended up by the creek that runs through the bottom of<br>
the valley. It's nothing like the creeks from my home state, all muddy<br>
and brown. No, this one was perfectly, unbelievably clear, like in a<br>
dream. Three more dudes were sitting by the creekside playing drums,<br>
and again, it seemed like they were playing to the beat of the<br>
river. Through the music, it seemed to me that they had uncovered the<br>
secret heartbeat of nature. Why hadn't I heard this before? (T+2:00)<br>
<br>
I sat there for nearly two hours, in the sun, listening to the drums,<br>
the river, and watching the golden spiderwebs of the morning sky dance<br>
across the perfectly clear water. I bathed in the radiance of the<br>
heartbeat, its warm, pulsating waves. The energy of that time was<br>
absolutely amazing.<br>
<br>
I find that, personally, with the exception of Ayahuasca, the 'comeup'<br>
of psychedelics in general is not nearly as useful, in terms of<br>
introspection, as the 'comedown'. That is, the comeup is more<br>
enjoyable, but, if I take anything away from the experience, I'm going<br>
to learn it while descending back to sobriety. That turned out to be<br>
especially true with this substance. During the last four hours or so,<br>
I spent a lot of time wandering around, both in the campground, and in<br>
my mind.<br>
<br>
I realized that my identity crisis was more an issue of where I was<br>
derived from. That is, I need to be part of a collective, a culture,<br>
perhaps, or a group of friends, but I cannot be OF that culture. Much<br>
like the flock of birds on the hill, I need to enter into it,<br>
independently, as a developed person, and bring something new to<br>
it. Any other way, I would either be defined by cultural norms, or an<br>
outcast. I need to push out my identity to those around me, rather<br>
than pulling in theirs. This was my problem, and the realization of<br>
this greatly settled my soul, and still does, as I write this more<br>
than a month later.<br>
<br>
After the sun had ascended so far into the sky that I could no longer<br>
justify calling this a 'perfect morning', I ended up back at the<br>
campsite of the people who had sold me the 2C-B. They were rolling up<br>
a blunt. Perfect. Everything had that shiny, plastic sheen of order,<br>
yet identity, about it. They invited me over to smoke. It was a<br>
wonderful, communal experience. I felt close with everything. I had a<br>
very intense feeling of having arrived home, at long last. (T+4:20)<br>
<br>
There was what seemed to be an extremely long period of intoxication,<br>
after the main effects had ended. This may or may not have been a<br>
product of all the marijuana I had smoked over the course of the day,<br>
though I suspect it was not. I had the same 'waves of energy' feeling,<br>
but without any of the visual activity, or really anything other than<br>
a mild feeling of drunkenness. It was not unpleasant in the slightest,<br>
but it did seem to go on well past the peak of the experience. I was<br>
just confused as to how I could still feel like I was tripping hard,<br>
but without any kind of visuals at all.<br>
<br>
I finally was completely sober around 3 or 4 PM. The world retained<br>
its beauty, however, and, strangely, the grass retained its surreal<br>
green color. Even today, I will occasionally come across a<br>
particularly green patch of grass in the morning or evening, with the<br>
sun falling across it just right, and I will again be overwhelmed with<br>
the beauty of the world.<br>
<br>
All in all, I think this was hands-down the best trip of my life. I<br>
didn't learn as much from this substance as I did from Ayahuasca, and<br>
it wasn't nearly as intense as LSD or psilocybin mushrooms, but,<br>
rather, a soft, warm day spent in paradise. I'm glad I had the<br>
opportunity to experience this. Highly recommended.<!--   End Body   -->

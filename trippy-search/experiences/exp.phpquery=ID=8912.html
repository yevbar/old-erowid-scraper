I have been using Kava for about a year.  This experience took place about 5 days ago when I used Kava to get my self asleep one night.  I was in bed at about 11:30 pm when I swallowed the 4 capsules (with 70% kava-lactones each); after they were down I laid back and waited for them to kick in.  After watching TV for around a half an hour I felt the effects coming on.  That’s when I turned the TV off, rolled over and fell asleep in a matter of seconds, around 12:00 am.  <BR>
<BR>
When I awoke the next day around 1:00 pm I was quite rested and thinking to my self that I haven’t slept like that in a long time.  But that all faded when the memories of the dream that I had that night came to light.  That dream, was probably the single most mind-blowing experience I have ever had.  As far as I can recall the dream lasted from the moment I fell asleep to the point of awakening.  The thing that was weird about the dream was that I was totally immersed into it. I could control my actions and was quite coherent in the dream.  It felt like a movie where I was the star, with the point of view of a camera following me around.  The dream was complete with each of the 5 senses and it was more detailed than any other dream I have ever had.  I even felt emotions and pain in the dream.  It’s hard to put words to this experience so please excuse the bland details.<BR>
<BR>
Over all, the experience didn't change my life but provided me with some entertainment while I was sleeping.  I have had very in-depth dreams before but none as far in as this was.  I was in a very clear and levelheaded mind set when I took the pills, and the experience was set in one of my more favorite places, my bed.  I swear by Kava, I feel it’s a safe and effective way to relax at the end of a long day and then eventually fade off into a deep, peaceful sleep.<BR>

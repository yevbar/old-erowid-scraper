<!--   Start Body   -->


It was my 19th birthday, and I was all set to have a mystical experience.  I said a prayer and took 7 deep hits of hashish.  I started to feel really strange, like my body was burning in a fire.  I didn't freak out though, I decided to take it as it came, and relax.  Usually when I smoke normal marijuana I feel hot, so the flame must just have been an exaggerated effect.  I felt like my body was dissolving, until I had no sense of either it or my ego.  The world started to manifest itself like a movie.  I could see frames flashing instead of what in a sober state would be normal fluid reality.  Another description for it would be like a strobe light.  Now, whenever I smoke weed I see this strobe light effect, but I never did before I had smoked Hashish.<br>
<br>
Then I began to regress, I felt like a child, full of wonder and not caring what the world thinks of me.  Then I began to feel like a wild animal running through the plains.  I could kind of 'see' all of this occuring, it was something like a daydream, but so much more intense.  After being an animal for awhile, I became a plant, and then I began regressing so fast, I could hardly tell what was happening to me.  I became a cell, and then, I felt like I was back with God.  I felt like I was in an all encompassing everythingness, but it was nothingness at the same time.<br>
<br>
I stayed in this state for a while, and then I began to rise back through the ranks of life, from cell, to plant, to animal, back to child, then adult, and then I became what I believe is the next phase of human evolution, and again rose to the God level.  I came back shortly to the above human level, then went to the child level again.  I remained there for the duration of the high, and gradually returned to my normal level of existence.  I realized profound things while I was in that state, and ever since, smoking normal weed has always been so much more profound.<!--   End Body   -->

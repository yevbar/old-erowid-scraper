About around 9:00pm me and my buddies had decided to smoke a bit and chill back, maybe go to a park with the spinny metal discs that I find in the parks. So we had chilled at my house, I smoked about 3.5 Grams of Pot, and listened to some music. Well we left the house around 10:30ish, we had decided to rally in a church parking lot and talk about where we were gonna go. So me and Buddy A ( In this case in the truck.) We pulled into the lot and as soon as we pull in we shut off our lights to surprise the others in the opposite car and blare them with brights... Right as we turn in I said.. Hey man theres a cop lets go he's gonna come back I know it. <BR>
<BR>
So in about 5 secs we pull up next to Buddy B( Driver ) and he had one friend, and 3 girls in his car.. So Buddy A said to him... If a cop comes let me do the talking k? So he did... within the next 10 seconds the cop circles back and comes up a different entrance.. trapping B in, at this time B starts the car like he's gonna go, so the cop blocks him in... The cop steps out and commands him out of the car as well as Buddy A... at about this point I’m freaked out there’s some pot in the middle console... 3 girls with us and a kid that could pass as a 7th grader yet he's in upper class of high school. <BR>
<BR>
He gets the drivers out and question the, licenses, questions if they're in trouble with the law, the cop comes over to me and asks me what’s up and what I’m doin out late, explaining we went to get a bite to eat and then go to the park and home.. He had flashed his light around the car a bit, by this time two more cars pull up to get information from the girls and the others, now I’m high like hell so we're all kinda shakin. The cop finally dismisses B as me and A are stuck here, the cop asks. Now is it alright if we search your car 'A'. A replies which was the stupidest thing EVER.. 'Yes officer that’s fine.'.<BR>
<BR>
Very quickly I remember if a cop asks me say.<BR>
<BR>
'Officer its really late and I'd like to get home. I'm very tired and would like to go home.'<BR>
<BR>
Worked Great.<BR>
<BR>
We pulled it off and left for the house. still paranoid so we dropped the ladies off and went back to the casa.<!--   End Body   -->

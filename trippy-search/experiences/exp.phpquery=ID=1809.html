I'm writing this to help someone like me wake up. I started experimenting with drugs about 5 years ago. First pot, then acid, then...well I can't exactly remember what came next but I can tell you I've tried almost everything but crack including heroin. After doing most drugs a few times I was able to give them up but cocaine and weed were always in my heart.<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately weed isn't too expensive, is easily available and pretty widely accepted as little worse than drinking alcohol. So I was a pothead no problem? But a coke head, that is were I ran in to some problems.<BR>
<BR>
I love coke, need coke , want coke even after I'm depressed, broke and at one point totally degraded. I'm telling this story to you the cocaine user to help you I hope, I've never told this anyone and I still try to black it out of mind, yet I still use coke.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway here goes, it was about a year ago, I went out to a local club with some people from work, we started drinking i think I smoked a joint and point being I was trashed. I met some guys, we talked, they mentioned coke and I was off leaving the people I came with behind.. We went to an apartment did some lines and I still don't know how I let this happen but all four of them had sex with me that night in front of each other, and I didn't care as long as they kept cutting out those lines...<BR>
<BR>
I hate myself for this really hate myself so I guess maybe that is why I still use drugs to block it out, who knows.. What I do know is on the outside I'm a normal 22 year old women, I have a decent job, I attend college at night and I have my own apartment and car. I appear to be doing alright, I even used to think I could just stop using coke when I wanted to, but I can't i still get sweaty palms and want to jump up and down at the thought of doing some. I don't use everyday but at least every other day, it is starting to really fuck up my life and I don't know what will happen to me.<BR>
<BR>
Please don't take this like I'm trying to be an after school special or something I just wanted to tell my story and tell you how much cocaine can mess with you even when you think your not an addict.<!--   End Body   -->

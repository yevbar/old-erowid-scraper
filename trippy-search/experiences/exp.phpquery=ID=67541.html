I am quite experienced with all of the major psychedelics. I have now done salvia many times, but when this trip happened it was my first major breakthrough on this particular substance.<br>
<br>
I had been in the local headshop when the desk clerk asked me if I had tried salvia divinorum before. I replied that I had not, but that I had read about its effects. He told me that they sold it, so I immediately bought a vial of 21X. I was excited, but a little nervous to begin the trip.<br>
<br>
I am normally very adamant about set and setting when using psychedelic substances. This trip started off with me being quite nervous, and being deceitful. The girl I was dating at the time was against me using psychedelic drugs, as she was well aware of my past drug history and knew I technically didn't 'need' any more drugs in my life. I threw caution to the wind that day my friends, and what a tragedy it became.<br>
<br>
I put an unknown and obviously too large amount of the extract in a standard glass pipe. Sitting on my bed in a comfortable position, I bring the flame up towards the bowl, hold it to the salvia and inhale a HUGE hit of thick smoke. I held the acrid smoke in my lungs for about 35 seconds. It was at this point that I began to feel 'something'. It was as if a switch had been flipped, and the walls of reality had begun to shatter around me. I set the bowl down and laid on my back, not knowing what to expect. Within seconds, I was catapulted into a realm of complete insanity and torture.<br>
<br>
I was standing at the base of a huge mountain range, full of fire. Everything was burning, and the smell of this I will never forget. A putrid smoke smelling of sulfur enveloped my very existence. As I looked around me, the souls of everyone else in existence came into focus. They surrounded me, numbering in the billions. We were all being drawn into the center of the valley of fire. In this valley lies 'THE MACHINE'. it loomed on the horizon, HUGE, and ALL KNOWING. The machine ended up being my air conditioner in reality, but at the time it was sent by 'god' to take vengeance on the souls of mankind for using drugs and being generally sinful and devious. I had absolutely no recollection of even doing a drug at that point. I thought this was the end of the world. Here I was, being drawn uncontrollably to this machine.<br>
<br>
As I grew closer to this enormous 'machine from god', I began to see people getting sucked into it. It was devouring souls at a massive rate. I could hear the machine destroying the physical body by grinding it up, and destroying the soul with some type of sonic weapon. The sound was of billions of people dying and writhing in agony. It was truly the gateway to hell. A terrifying experience to say the least. Once the machine had selected me for destruction, I felt my arms and legs being ripped from me, ground up and destroyed. I BECAME the writing mass of pain combined with the pain of all others who had been, or would ever be taken by 'the machine'. My life was over, and I was in some eternal hell (which I don't even really BELIEVE in).<br>
<br>
About this time I had a glimmering hope appear on the horizon of what was left of my broken soul and maimed body. I saw my mirror, IN MY BEDROOM!!!! I suddenly remembered that I had smoked something, although it took a few more seconds to remember what it was. I knew I was back into this reality, I had remembered. My body was OK, and I was alive. I immediately lost my mind, and began crying my eyes out like a 12 year old girl. It was not tears of sadness, but tears of joy for having survived this horrible incident. I immediately wrote down bits and pieces of this traumatic event, as I wanted to remember it forever.<br>
<br>
I felt guilty about lying to my girl, so I told her as soon as she got home. She was not overly upset. She couldn't even begin to understand what I had just experienced. It was all very real to me at the time. Despite the fact that I have abused so many drugs, and done so many high dose experiments with LSD, Mescaline, and Mushrooms, MDMA, Ketamine, etc etc, this was really within my top 5 most mind blowing experiences of my whole life. The #1 most mind blowing experience of my life was a dangerously high dose IM ketamine experiment. But that my friends is another story.<!--   End Body   -->

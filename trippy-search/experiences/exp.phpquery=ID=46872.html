I was so happy, no school on a Tuesday. Nothing to do, no school shit or anything. I and my friends had been planning on doing nutmeg for a while; we had been looking for a cheaper way to get high. Around 2 o’clock we headed to the local grocery store to pick up a bottle, it was like 2 dollars for 90 grams hahaha. So we get back to my house and we open the bottle. The stuff smelt awful. At first I thought I would dissolve it in water. The mixture looked so repulsive I couldn’t build the courage to down it. So I decided to just chuck tablespoons of it down my throat. I took the first table spoon, nicely heaped and shoved it in. It was the most terrifying taste and I almost choked on it. I had a whole glass of water with it and it all went down. I waited about ten minutes and did it again. Of course this stuff takes like 3 hours to take effect so I had to wait. By this time it was 3:30.<br>
<br>
We headed to my friends house to hang out. He had some cigarettes and I decided to have one I couldn’t wait to start feeling the nutmeg. I think the cigarette helped bring on the drunk feeling of nutmeg because after the cigarette I was feeling really light headed and dazed. We left my friends house at around 4:30 we went to some girl I don’t knows house and we were chillin there some of my friends had some cigarettes but basically we were just fucking around. Someone brought out some Bacardi and redbull. I took a good shot of it. After that I was feelin the drunk a lil more. We went to go sit outside and someone had a gram of chronic we decided to roll it and smoke. This may not have been the best thing for me to do but it made my trip so much more intense. I took about 5 hits off of it. It was about 5:30 and the nutmeg was taken effect along with the chronic. My eyes got bloodshot red and my heart was beating 5 times in a second. My eyes we closing, if felt as if the world were getting narrower and closing around me. When I looked up the edges of everything was glowing.<br>
<br>
It’s hard to remember stuff that happened after that. My sense of time was completely gone. Minutes felt like days and sometimes hours felt like a minute. I remember going to her attic which was where we hung out but when I think about it I remember it like a club where I was for hours but we were only there for 10 minutes. I remember having extreme cotton mouth, like it felt like I was breathing cotton. It was kinda nasty but I remember finding a cup and drinking water. But people said that I didn’t. We left the girl's house an hour after we got there but for some reason it felt like a day had passed in her house. We went to McDonald's cuz we were all extremely hungry. I remember being scared of the manager there cuz he was yelling at somebody. And then I remember taking someone’s drink because of the cotton mouth. I would randomly have flashbacks of stuff that happened a minute ago and it would all play over like a movie.<br>
<br>
After we finished eating we got in the car and went to my friend’s house where we had started the day. On the way there the hallucinations hit me, every small thing would vibrate to the music in the car and when I closed my eyes I'd see a tunnel of flames with a man falling though it, all singing to the music, it was kinda awesome. It felt like it took days to reach my friend's house and when we got there I was feeling really tired.<br>
<br>
I have small fragments of memories from his house. I remember falling asleap. I remember taping some guy to the couch. An hour passed in his house. We decided that we were bored and we went to go see some friends that were workin in a store so we went and messed around there for a little while. It was about 8 o’clock. I felt the narrowing feeling go away, the flashbacks went away and my sense of time improved. I was still laughing allot. The whole time my laughing was sort of independent from me. Sometimes I would just be laughing uncontrollably.<br>
<br>
The effect was starting to go away, or so I thought. So I went with my friend to his girlfriend's house and we hung out there for a while. I had a Philly blunt and went home. I figured it was over but I was surprised it was so short when it was supposed to last for the entire day. When I got home I sat on my computer and talked to people, sorta in this unconcentrated daze. I noticed the letters on the screen shaking it seemed as if the letters were drooping.<br>
<br>
I couldn’t look at the screen anymore it was making me nauseous. I put on some trance music and lay in my bed. This was the best part. When I closed my eyes I felt as if I was walking though a forest and the music felt as if it were playing on my skin, I could feel the music the rhythm. It was the most unique experience. And the forest felt so real. I think that was when I fell asleep. I woke up at 4:30 am with an intense nauseous feeling. I think it was all the food I ate. I just sat in the bathroom for an hour until the feeling went away and went back to sleep.<br>
<br>
The next morning I had to wake up at 8 am. It was hell. I was extremely hung over. But it was like I clear headed hangover. Like I didn’t give a shit about anything, or anyone. It was a hang over of self confidence. It was kinda nice. It was almost like being high... almost... kinda interesting. As the day came to an end I started feeling like me again. The effects are all gone and I don’t taste nutmeg in my mouth at all. Over all it was a once in a life time experiance. I dunno if I'll do it again, maybe some day again but not anytime soon again. Its one of those things u wanna enjoy once in a while.<!--   End Body   -->

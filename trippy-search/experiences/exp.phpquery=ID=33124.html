I have no idea where I got the idea to try Diphenhydramine from, because information on it is not as widespread as other legal drugs, and it was actually in my medicine closet. I guess I must have been very desperate to change my perception of the world one night, and so I rooted through my medicine closet and took only the meds with only one active ingredient. I managed to find a bottle of Stop and Shop Allergy medicine, and after looking it up on this, I decided to down the whole bottle (295mg). The only active ingredient was Diphenhydramine. This drug was one that did not seem to have a huge fan base, but I am always willing to try new and inventive ways of intoxicating myself. <br>
<br>
I didn’t really feel much for the first 40-50 minutes. About an hour after drinking the nasty liquid, I got the weirdest feeling in the back of my head. I really don’t remember much after that; I do remember having a strange feeling in my entire body, which I can only describe as a body buzz. In school the next day I almost blacked out a few times, because I was still relatively high. This drug is the most like a roller coaster than any that I have tried to date. Sometimes, even while sitting in a chair or something, I felt like I was falling. I remember reaching for papers in English class, and feeling like I was falling out of my desk. Man oh man. There are also the effects on vision after the drug has stopped rampaging the senses. I noticed that everything looked slightly more harsh and real after this trip. There are also occasionally flashbacks, and bright flashes out of the corners of my eyes. <br>
<br>
This is the strongest effect that I have gotten from any drug that I have ever taken. Diphenhydramine is a really scary/fun/interesting drug, that is totally lost to the general public. Also, a word to the wise, never trip in school!<!--   End Body   -->

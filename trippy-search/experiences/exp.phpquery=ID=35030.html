I am 25 years, old married with a son.  I am a Natural Scientist. I am as many are in this world, looking for understanding of existence in my own way. I prefer an open minded approach including everything from religion and nature to science and logic.  Whatever your spiritual preference is or if you have one at all does not impact the methods and practices used in this experience.  My spiritual faith was of much aid in the experience but that is for my person. I am an experienced cannabis user and smoke the occasional tobacco product as is acceptable in my beliefs.  Ones moral beliefs can affect the experience if they believe it is wrong or unnatural to to as is written here and I would suggest that if someone feels this is wrong or unnatural then please have an open mind. I feel that 'trying' or experimenting' with something should be done with positive intent and in hopes of gaining understanding. I do not take any prescription medication, was not sick, and had cleared my mental road before the actual ingestion of P. Cubensis. <BR>
<BR>
Depending on the individual the setting would vary, as long as the resulting state of mind would be the same.  Examples: Indoors, Outdoors, Public Place, Private Place, Dark Area, Light Area, Natural Area (forest, woods, camping etc..), Synthetic Area (House, Room, Gymnasium, Disneyland etc...), alone, with friends or family or with unfamiliar people.  An individual should choose the setting that would put them at peace.  The setting I chose was my home, alone with nowhere to go for the day as to fully immerse myself in the experience without distraction.  Ensuring all possible necessities were available (Plenty of Healthy Fluids available: Orange Juice, Water, Milk and several kinds of green and herbal teas, Computer with internet access, several religios books, Plenty of high grade cannabis, cigars and incense.  All of these I have on my patio in complete privacy and in my home during this experience.<BR>
<BR>
I started the experience 2 months ago in terms of starting preparation.  Preparation is the key in everything.  Knowing ones self before the actual intake of the substance is vital to retention of information available by an experience such as this one.  As is normal and right in my beliefs I started my first 3 day fast.  According to Biblical doctrine, to fast is to refrain from food and/or drink for a given amount of time that is necessary for what one is seeking.  The Bible and its affiliated religions are not alone in fasting, several other religions use fasting as a tool in purification among other tools.  During the fast the mind must be pure, loving and peaceful.  The desire for food slowly slips away as I pray and meditate.  Over the course of the 3 days I drank nothing but Green Tea, Ginger Tea, Orange Juice, Water and a glass of milk maybe once a day if at all, smoked approximately .125 oz. of cannabis, smoked approximately 10 little cigars while praying, meditating and listening to music.  Nowhere to go but inside myself.  <BR>
<BR>
Experience with Cannabis and Cigars during a 3 day fast:<BR>
I started by filling the large bowl of reptar(name of my piece) and proceeded to take the normal amount of 3 good hits and then smoke 2 cigarettes.  Before the smoking my body felt clean due to the intent of the fast.  The cannabis helped to center myself as it always does.  The little cigars were Primtime Cherry and is my preference although any tobacco product would be suitable.  The effect of the tobacco increases the state induced by the cannabis in a positive way.  The effects were pleasant and increased my sense of peace and tranquility.  My ability to reason logic increased with the disappearance of distraction and random thought.  Concentration was easy and I began my search for what I has set out to search for.  Everyone is searching for something, does not have to be the same thing.  <BR>
<BR>
The 3 days ended with satisfactory results in my search.  Noticeable after-effects:  Loss of Desire or necessity to eat.  I physically felt great.  Clear thought and pure intent.  Motivated to search more.  I began eating again but not as before.  Good, natural wholesome food is desired more than junk food.  Before a big soda drinker and now there aren't any sodas in the house and haven’t been for a month now.  Beer is not in my refrigerator anymore.  I will drink soda or beer if I am so inclined but the necessity to have these things often is gone and not by force but rather by nature.  Appetite is such that I eat until I am satisfied but am satisfied with much less food.  Naturally loving to cook I began to make better dishes in terms of content and nourishment.  All changes in day to day habits were a result of the experience.  To clarify if necessary, I did not try as in work trying but more as in I changed things that were unnatural to BE more natural.  <BR>
A few weeks pass and I repeat the same activities mentioned above and fasted another 3 days.  Results were an increase of the previous changes along with new changes.  Alot of personal and spiritual 'progress' was made and a clarity was retained.  After the fast I resumed eating as after the first fast retaining all the changes from the first and second fast.  <BR>
<BR>
I had ordered some P. Cubensis and began preparation for the experience.  I prepared by scheduling a day with my personal affairs in order to provide the above mentioned setting for this experience (alone at home with all the tools and necessities).  3 days before the day I was to receive the P. Cubensis I began the third three day fast.  Following the same activities as before.  The fourth day I woke in the morning, bid my family good day as they were to be gone for the day to provide this setting.  At 10:00 a.m. I ingested approximately 3-4 of the 3-4' tall stem with 1' caps in their 'wet' state.  Fresh, not dried out.  I Mixed approximately half of a cup of orange juice and the P. Cubensis in the blender for 2 minutes providing a pleasant tasting shot.  I proceeded to the area where I would be for the majority of my experience, my patio.  The patio has the music (cd discman) Drinks, Cannabis, Cigars, incense, chair, table, pen, paper.  I began my usual regimen of cannabis and cigars as I would normally on a day of fast.  The effects of the P. Cubensis was noticable after approximately 10 minutes.  Beginning mildly increasing the effects of the cannabis and cigars.  I meditated for the next hour with music.  Unsure as to the potency of the sample and not having a proper scale to determine personal threshold I was aware of the difference in effects of the cannabis and the P. Cubensis.  <BR>
<BR>
12:15 p.m. and I feel as if I should take some more.  Instead of mixing in orange juice I felt I should try and eat them plain.  After vomiting out the first cap that I tried to chew up I decided to try another way. Fortunately I had been on a fast and there was not much to regurgitate other than orange juice and water.  After the release, I felt a vibration in my body.  I knew that feeling was the effects of the sample previously ingested.  Expecting some sort of a peak at 90 to 120 minutes this seemed logical.  It was not intense or overwhelming as I had thought it would be so I sought another means of ingestion. I decided to make a sandwich using one piece of white bread with mustard.  I placed approximately 4 stems with caps into the fold and ate.  I could not taste the sample which was a good thing and it went down well.  As I sat in my living room which was lit by lamps and such with curtains drawn I began to feel the effects increase but slightly.  I finished the sandwich and relaxed in mediation for a short time.  After my meditation with slightly increasing effects I spent some time in my home, turning off the lights and producing a darkness in my house.  I proceeded into various rooms to feel the room.  I spent much time in the bathroom as it was the darkest room.  Never was there any fear or anything fearful in my experience, just peace and understanding.  <BR>
<BR>
About 2:00 p.m. I returned to the patio to relax.  The difference between indoors and outdoors was noticeable.  I found myself on the threshold of the door feeling both differences being inside was completely dark and outside was sunshine.  I remained on the patio for the next few hours. For the next half hour I would sit, relax and meditate on the patio with the effects increasing slightly.  I smoked another bowl of cannabis and a few more cigars.  Centered and at peace with no feeling of anticipation, anxiety, fear or discomfort as I feel normally during a fast.  30 minutes or so had passed and I noted what I would call the peak of the experience.  2:30 p.m.  I put on a song of choice. The song is not specific, it is different with each individual.  I chose a song that had meaning to me in the lyrics, the music and personal meaning. I began writing many things on my notepad to the point I was running out of paper.  (note..The things that I found in my searching and wrote down are not included in this report as I haven't finished them)  I continued in what I considered the peaked state for several hours and continued to smoke cannabis and cigars.  I drank juice and water throughout this experience.  <BR>
<BR>
Approximately 5:00 p.m. I was still feeling peaked and continued to write, alternating between meditation and writing.  Being in the fourth day I decided to eat, I microwaved some awesome chilaquiles that were brought over from family.  Eating was pleasant and I could feel the body heat generated by the chiles in the food.  I watched a little tv while I ate as I normally do.  Upon finishing of my food I ventured into my office and entertained myself with collections of music, videos, music videos and research for about an hour or so.  <BR>
<BR>
About 6:45 p.m. I returned to the patio and remain there for the remainder of the experience.  Not feeling quite peaked in body feeling but mental feeling was clearer than ever and continues to be this way today.  I spent the last few hours doing the same as before, meditating, praying, praising, writing, smoking and writing more.  About 10:30 my family returns and I feel my experience was a success.  I set out to accomplish something in this experience and I feel I achieved more than I ever thought possible in mental, scientifical and spiritual growth.  In general I entered into this experiment in search of understanding.  What I received was much more and it hasn't gone away.  Change for the better.  Preparation.  Pure Intent.  Success.<BR>
<BR>
In conclusion I find that the combination of methods used (fasting, cannabis, tobacco and P. Cubensis) proved to be better than expected.  In search of truth and understanding I look forward to my next experience with P. Cubensis.  I would recommend experimentation in this manner if one has pure intent.  If one ventures into the realm where this fungi dwells with negativity, the result will be negativity.  Overall the most specific effect felt with P. Cubensis was the ability to stop and see.  We move through life so fast that we can't see what IS.  I encourage everyone to stop and look around, you might be surprised at what you see. I hope my efforts in preparation provide insight for your future experiences.  Here are a few quotes that I enjoy.<BR>
<BR>
'Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.' --Einstein, Albert <BR>
<BR>
'A human being is part of the whole, called by us 'Universe,' a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest - a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation, and a foundation for inner securit' - Einstein, Albert'Science without religion is lame, Religion without science is blind.' - Einstein, Albert<BR>
<BR>
I hope for world enlightenment but pray for peace.  -Martin H.<!--   End Body   -->

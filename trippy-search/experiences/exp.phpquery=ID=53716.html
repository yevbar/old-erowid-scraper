Let me give you some background information on me first so you might be able to better understand my trip.  A friendship of mine had very recently dissolved so I was somewhat sad at the time of ingestion.  Also, I had not gotten any sleep the night before this so the trip would be very intense, due to exhaustion.  My true reasons for doing this was to see if my altered mind might be able to sort out my life as it is at the moment.  Although I didn't reach my goal, I still had a terrifyingly beautiful time. <br>
<br>
I had been thinking about doing an extraction of LSA but decided to just grind up the seeds in a coffee grinder and ingest them.  I decided against the extraction because I really didn't have the time to do all the intricate processes on account of my parents would get highly pissed off if they ever caught onto what I was doing.  At 12:15 I dosed on the seeds.  After only about 30 mins I felt myself coming up.  Actually, much like the come up on LSD.  However, as I was coming up, my stomach started feeling worse and worse.  After about 1 hour I was holding my stomach 100% sure I was about to puke.  I was able to hold of the bile and proceded to take some Pepto-Bismol.<br>
<br>
The Pepto helped a little bit, so I decided to lay back down on my couch.  At this time a cop knocked on my house right as I was getting settled.  THANK GOD I wasn't fully tripping yet or else I would have been royally fucked.  The cop said someone had called about a gray house in my neighborhood being broken into by some kids.  He was just checking all the houses in the neighborhood, and I heaved a huge mental sigh. I might add I kind of saw this in my mind.  It was like seeing your brain doing what your chest does when you sigh.  Interesting.  I gave him some ID and told him my house number and he went on his way.<br>
<br>
About 30 mins after the cop stopped by a friend of mine came over with a blunt and a gram of reggs.  I was jumping with joy because my nausea was starting to come back.  However this time I was fully of the grips of the LSA, and the nausea only served to push me into tripspace even further.  He rolled up the blunt and he proceded to smoke it in my backyard.  From the first hit my stomach felt better.  Not only that, but smoking seemed to double my trip.  After we finished he left and things started to get VERY interesting.<br>
<br>
The first thing that told me I was in the throes of the most intense feeling of my life was looking out at the clouds.  I know you probably hear 'The clouds look like they're painted in the sky' from a lot of people.  But, the clouds actually were dripping paint off of themselves in the sky.  This really freaked me out because I was only expecting a mild trip, not something more intense than my last acid trip!  After I looked at the clouds I noticed that taking a full breath wasn't exactly hard per-say, but it felt odd and my breath was very shallow if not quick.  I went out to smoke a ciggarette to calm myself down.  NOT a good idea.  As I was halfway through, I had to put it out.  Taking a breath through the ciggarette just felt too odd, too alien to finish the full smoke.  This has NEVER happened to me before.  I usually smoke around 1/4-1/2 a pack a day so I was started questioning myself, asking myself 'Why can't you finish this?'.  I heard nothing but I had the idea to check my pulse and test it.  I THINK it might have just been my mind tricking myself, but I recorded it at 100 BPM. This really freaked me out so I ran up stairs to try to calm myself down.<br>
<br>
All this took place in the span of about 30 mins, but it felt like an eternity.  However it was starting to get late.  It was 3:30, 3 hours and 15 mins after I dosed.  My mom gets home around 5:30 so I started freaking out.  Thinking I was fucked, thinking I was going to be put into rehab, thinking my life was over.  I think this was all because of my mind set.  To try to sober myself up I tried to Meditate.  I sat down on my floor with my back straight and the rest of my posture very relaxed.  It felt very natural to me.  I closed my eyes and dissapeared into my mind.<br>
<br>
This point I started to notice how far over the edge I was.  I felt intense energy in my body, and I wondered if I could control it.  I saw this energy centered in my chest, as a multi-colored substance within me.  I tried to send some energy to my head to see if I could.  Instantly I felt my head get filled up with this energy and in my eyelids I was a sudden light fill them.  I was very surprised.  I sent the energy back to my chest because my head started felling very intense and it started feeling very heavy and like it was spinning.  I was back to my image of my body in my mind.  I saw 7 major points in my body: Head, Left arm, Left Leg, Right Leg, Right Arm, Throat, and the Center of my Body.  Without thinking about it I sent this energy to all seven points at once.<br>
<br>
I started feeling much better, my nausea completely gone so I opened up my eyes. I'd like it to be said that I have NEVER had such a vivid CEV before and if taken acid many times.  As by habit my eyes took in my posters, and I feel to my floor, just staring at them, yet not really seeing THEM.  I have a Pink Floyd Poster of womens tattoos of all the album covers.  My eyes were riveted by the Wish You Were Here tat.  I saw the men who were shaking hands walk up to each other shake hands then dissappear.  Trying to give myself excuse to not look at this I looked outside.  I saw absolutely no life outside at all.  I started questioning if I was a part of humanity.  The lack of life outside only furthered this feeling.  This again freaked me out so I went down to watch TV to prove to myself that I was only freaking out, and was still a part of humanity.<br>
<br>
Watching TV was a blast.  I couldn't focus on ANYTHING so trying to follow the plot was impossible.  Soon I just was watching the TV but my mind was elsewhere.  I look at the clock and was surprised to see that it was getting very close to 5.  My meditation and staring had taken up and hour and a half while it seems only 5 minutes!  I was quite surprised seeing a how all the time before this seemed to be stretched out over an eternity.  I decided that taking a shower might help sober myself up so my mom wouldn't be suspicious.  When I hopped in and the water started hitting my skin, I couldn't feel it at all.  It felt more lie wind than water.  Even though I was taken aback for a second I knew what I had to do and I finished my shower, felling not one bit more sober.  <br>
<br>
When my mom came home at 6, we went to the store and I said that I had been feeling nausous all day, so she got me a bagel and some juice (first thing I had eaten/drank all day).  As soon as we came home I decided to see if I could finish a full cig, which I did.  After the cig my mom told me to go to bed and I complied.  I just woke up about and hour ago after sleeping for 13 hours straight.  I'm still quite groggy, but feel quite amazing.  Definately an expirience I would want to do again.  I think that I'll do an extraction next time so I won't have any nausea. Maybe sublingually as I have heard that this is best.<!--   End Body   -->

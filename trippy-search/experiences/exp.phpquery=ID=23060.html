It all began on a boring wendsday night, the past few nights I had been experimenting with SOMA and flexril, they were okay but gave me a bit of a dead feeling in my limbs nothin extreme, so I decide to try somthing new<BR>
<BR>
I have been off lexapro for about 4 months and I had a ton of them just layin around my house so I decide to take a big dose of them and see how they affected me at a high dose. For some reason I didnt seem to think it would do anything  because I had taken it so many times, so I decided to pop 10 of them, they come in 10mg tabs. About an hour later I wasnt feeling anything so I decided to take a flexril and get all nice and relaxed and go to sleep. About 40 minutes feeling nicely relaxed I went to bed at about 11. I fell into a deep sleep quickly, clear headed and happy. <BR>
<BR>
All of the sudden it was midnight, I woke up in a cold sweat to someone screaming at me, I didnt know what to think, I quickly looked around the room, nothing, figured I was dreaming and just woke up, fell back to sleep. 20 minutes later I woke up again, all I could see when I opened my eyes was a long dark hall, I thought I was dreaming, so I slapped myself and started talking to myself, I was awake...... and all I could see was this hall, unmoving in my sight, just fixed there. I sat and looked at the hall for about an hour, I couldnt do much, I couldnt see at all. then the weirdest thing began to happen, the realest hallucination I have ever encountered, people screaming, sounded like thousands of them, I couldnt make it stop, this kept on until about 4 o'clock, then they stopped, and I could see again. I felt disturbed to say the least, this was the scariest thing I have ever encountered.<BR>
<BR>
Its now been 3 days and I am still encountering problems, my eyes are still very dilated, they wont contract at all, I think if it doesnt fix itself in a few days I am going to see  a doctor. Also, I have been noticing that I feel almost 'low' like somthing is bothering me alot, but I dont know what it is.  <BR>
<BR>
Also I still have cotton mouth, its not pleasant. The trip was scary to say the least.<!--   End Body   -->

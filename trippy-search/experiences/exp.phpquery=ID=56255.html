I've been clean and sober for about 3 months now, after 28 days in rehab. I went to rehab because the things I had previously loved most (and still hold dear), drugs, had quite literally ruined my life. But that is neither here nor there. I write this to dispel some myths and clear up some issues regarding use / abuse of MDMA. <br>
<br>
I love ecstacy. I just don't do it anymore. I loved it from the first time I tried it - how could I not? It felt great, and completely in the face of what others told me, I did not wait for my brain to 'recharge' before doing it again. They told me wait at least two weeks, I did it again the next weekend. And the weekend after that. And the weekend after that. Time passed, though my perception of it became increasingly vague, and after a while I found myself in a drug user's paradise: free drugs, anytime, anywhere. Paid in full, always top-quality. Given this sort of access, I did something insane. I took MDMA, and did not stop for eight consecutive days and nights. I slept a few hours here and there, but I was most definitely intoxicated for the entire 192 hours. It felt like the greatest experience of my life right up until the end. This is where the clarification starts.<br>
<br>
Most people don't find this out the hard way, but tolerance to ecstacy builds up extremely fast. By the last 24 hours, I had swallowed, snorted, or chewed up 11 1/2 MDMA pills of very high quality (I know this because other, normal people took the same pills and achieved the desired state of mind), and I felt nothing - maybe a small buzz. I haven't taken MDMA since, I found myself in rehab less than a week later. <br>
<br>
Some observations I have made since:<br>
<br>
1. Abuse of MDMA most certainly damages the facilities of memory. Even today, months later, my memory - both short and long term - is unreliable, at best, though it has been getting better and better as time progresses.<br>
<br>
2. MDMA flashbacks are real. They have grown less frequent and less intense, but they do happen. Notably, these flashbacks only occur when I have some other substance in my body - nowadays, caffeine or nicotine. They usually last less than a minute, and they are not as intense as an actual MDMA trip, but still very characteristic of MDMA intoxication: intense body high, clenching of the jaw, feelings of well-being. These now happen maybe one in ten times I smoke a cigarette or drink something heavily caffeinated. I have met one other MDMA abuser who has reported similar experiences.<br>
<br>
3. The usual 'brain-dead' feeling that follows MDMA use for one to three days (maybe more, depending on the person and strength) is exponentially multiplied by consecutive use. I was basically a walking, talking vegetable for two weeks, and it took two more weeks until I actually felt sober.<br>
<br>
4. MDMA use most definitely impacted my emotional stability. The first six weeks I was clean and sober were an emotional rollercoaster. I still have fairly powerful mood swings (usually swinging down), but much less frequently.<br>
<br>
5. Sexual climax is noticeably harder for me to reach.<br>
<br>
6. While MDMA abuse has had the aforementioned effects on me, it would seem my intelligence emerged unscathed. It took a few weeks for it to show its face again - it actually came flooding back during a lecture in rehab about neurochemistry. The lecturer knew only basic facts, and I basically raised my hand and corrected him out of nowhere. Hell, I didn't even see it coming.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps those searching for answers. I know I probably can't stop anyone from taking drugs, and I don't intend to, or even want to. All I'll say is this: Take it easy, and play it safe.<!--   End Body   -->

I consumed five grams of Sceletium tortuosum powdered material over seven days, during which I found the plant to provide effective mood elevation, and even periods of elation and euphoria.  I remember in particular riding my bike home after a four hour chemistry lab, having taken the Sceleium an hour previous as encapsulated material, and feeling as though I could conquer the world.  Since with depression comes lack of both self-confidence and motivation, and since these were temporarily of no concern to me, I concluded that the joy I was experiencing was merely the lifting of an underlying depression from my normal state.  I immediately hailed the drug as being one chemical step closer to Huxley’s Soma, or as I see it, a drug whose frequent use could create bliss as an everyday state.  Unlike the Soma of BNW, I could function normally under its influence.  In fact, my social character and clarity of thought both seemed much improved during the duration of the drug’s effect.  <BR>
<BR>
However, any casual observer could immediately identify this attitude toward a chemical as the formation of an unhealthy dependence.  My own casual observer played this role.  Somewhere in my mind I asked, “Why not feel this good?”  My response, that there was no reason, was probably aided by my misperception of Sceletium as safe, and as a mild sort of social “performance enhancing” herb to be used frequently.  I began to develop a true sense for the implications of my attitude for Sceletium after the powder ran out.  The following two weeks I was haunted with the desire to take more.  I cursed myself for not buying the most for the cheapest.  I realized that if the drug was perhaps an opiate, and I felt the same way after discontinuing its use, that I would say that I was experiencing [at least psychological] addiction.  Like with opiates, Sceletium may tease the mind with a sense of euphoria even long after the discontinuation of its use.<!--   End Body   -->

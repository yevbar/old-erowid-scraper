This report will cover a day long experience with the mindless bliss that is associated with opiate and synthetic based opiate substances. While I realize that my portions are quite high for the beginner or curious user, it should be noted that I have built a tolerance in the past few days to such opiates which would allow me to handle midline dosages. This meaning, the past few nights I dabbled with increasing dosages daily over a specific period. I would highly suggest to everyone to know how your body reacts to drugs, specifically pharmaceuticals, and do intense research to understand both why and when the dosages should be managed. Especially with a drug like oxycodone and hydrocodone, these can become extremely addictive if you have easy access  and continue to repeat high dosages over time. Do not underestimate this drug and discourage access! <br>
<br>
About My Usage<br>
My access and use of substances is limited. Although I attend an Ivy League university, I find myself using less drugs than my fellow classmates. I don't like to smoke pot. I don't like to hallucinate. Rather, I do find that I enjoy the downer effects of pharmaceutical pills offer. Like most people, access to these pills is a once in a while find, usually the left over product of a broken bone or surgery. When I do get access, I find that both [synthetic]opiates and benzodiazepines provide an escape into mindless euphoria that can be enjoyable on occasion.  This experience represents my first trip into the multiple usage of the drugs. While at most, I have only tried the drugs recreationally a few times before and NEVER in repetition (for fear of physical addiction).<br>
<br>
The Experience<br>
12:00 [20mg]= After having built up a tolerance for Oxycodone the past 2 nights, I felt that I should start the day with relatively high dosage of 20mg. I chewed both pills, knowing that the absence of acetaminophen would make them tolerable. After about 20 minutes, I felt that enjoyable warmth of the opiate kicking in. After eating lunch with some friends, I was completely comfortable and feeling a real nice kick coming ing. Knowing what to expect, I spent the next hour enjoying the escalation of effects.<br>
<br>
13:30 [10mg]= The peak had occurred around 13:00, by which I felt one more pill would keep a warm feel going. While not as high at this point,  I knew that my body could handle 30mg. After ingesting the third pill, I knew it would take around 20-30 minutes for the effect to take hold. At this point the body high is at it's peak, every major muscle in my body feels as though they've been elevated and ameliorated.<br>
<br>
13:30= The third pill has extended the euphoria but has not provided the initial high that was felt with the first dosage at 12:00. I have yet to peak but the addition has definitely enhanced the experience. No negative effects at this point, the only downside is the occasional itch and forget fullness. Up to this point it has been both enjoyable and quite invigorating. I have felt more open with friends and felt much more comfortable in public. <br>
<br>
15:00 [120]= The drug has peaked and I can begin to feel it wane. I still feel comfortable and quite happy  with my surroundings but it is definitely not as strong as before. So, knowing that the biological half life of Oxycodone is 2.5-3 hours, i continued my opiate adventure by ingesting two Tylenol 4 pills with 60mg codeine and 750mg paracetamol. <br>
<br>
15:30= I can feel the two Tylenol pills taking hold, while not as strong as the oxycodone they do ad on to the effect by providing a more mentally stimulating high. I can still focus and feel sober in my though process, but my mood is highly elevated. It is a nice feeling. Much more itching now then normal, but by this point a larger percentage of the oxycodone has metabolized through my system.<br>
<br>
17:00= I can feel the effects beginning to wane. Much more itching then before.<br>
<br>
19:00 [20mg]= I decided to finish my final two 10mg pills of oxycodone. My ingested the two (I never snort do to issues regarding pill binders and chemical additives). By now, the initial levels of my earlier oxycodone ingestion should have passed through do to the fast level of metabolism and half-life. I would never suggest to someone who is opiate naive to take such multiple dosages because not only will their tolerance not be able to handle such dosing, but the half life of the drug might be much longer do to lack of enzyme production in ones system.<br>
<br>
19:30= I can feel the onset of the 20mg, a warm fuzzy feeling is beginning to take over my mind and all cares are once again out the window. The increase in feelings of the oxycodone mask the diminishing codeine as the two begin to flood my brain. Once again I feel much more at ease with conversation and I enjoy both everything and everyone around me. Opiates produce such a unique appreciation for life that makes me understand why people can choose to repeatedly do this daily.<br>
<br>
20:15= The initial high is dwindling down.<br>
<br>
23:30 [2.5]= I can feel the effects are wearing off, I am becoming much more tired. With each dosage I found the effects of the opiates to take a different level of feeling. From a scale of 1 to 10. The First dosage would be a 8, the second would be a 4 and the third would be a 6. The first dosage is always the best because it overflows your system with the necessary neurotransmitters to chemically induce euphoria. After that, the rest of the day was spent floating in a mindless bliss, creating a nice but temporary escape from the necessary pressures of life. Now I am about to fall asleep, I have a final usage of a half of teaspoon of Doxylamine Succinate. This will provide 2.5mg of hydrocodone and 2mg succinate. This has so far provided a nice relaxing body feeling and made me very sleepy. The Succinate has acted as an antihistamine and gotten rid of all the itches.<br>
<br>
23:45 By this time I have calculated there should around 13.75mg of oxycodone still metabolized in my system along with 15mg of codeine. <br>
<br>
This experience is a trial experience only. I do not suggest anybody repeat it. Doing too many opiates and high dosages without knowing your tolerance or how your body metabolizes each chemical can cause fatal results. While I was successful in titrating throughout the day, I believe i was because I have done deep research and begun to understand how such drugs work. Realize how your body is and how your body reacts before you decide to even take such recreational experiences. <br>
<br>
Also, be care with these drugs. Building up your tolerance is extremely dangerous, you can get extremely addicted and end up with a pricey habit. Know the difference between 'trying something new out' and 'trying something new to never stop the effects.'<!--   End Body   -->

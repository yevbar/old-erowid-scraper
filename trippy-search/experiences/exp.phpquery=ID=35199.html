(Intro)<BR>
<BR>
Well, there is a alot to say for this substance and not a whole lot that has been said about it. I've always been a curious person and when I was introduced to the world of psychoactive substances years ago I couldn't help but find myself searching out for new, unique substances on which to experiment with. I've only been at baseline for around an hour or so now and am still taking in what had all happened so please bare with me.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
(Background Information)<BR>
<BR>
Let me give some background information about myself, for those interested. I am a 22 year-old (174 lb 6'2')college student who has has his fair share of psychoactive substances over the years. I have experienced the most widely used and abused drugs as well as the more unknown and/or 'new' substances such as this. It's not necessarilly something to be proud of, but I've experimentated with marijuana, psilocybin mushrooms, amanita muscaria mushrooms, salvia divornum, cocaine, ether, nitrous, MDMA, MDA, alcohol, AMT, 5-MeO-AMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, a vast array of pharmaceuticals, and more recently 2C-I. The past few years of my life I haven't dosed much of anything at all with exception to a few 'research chemicals' mentioned above. This is mainly because I wish only to experiment with things new to myself; substances I haven't yet explored and that's only because my interest never ceases to intrigue me to do so.<BR>
<BR>
Anyhow, the important thing here is the experience itself. 5-methoxy-N,N-diallytryptamine (5-MeO-DALT) brings alot to the table and it leaves the user eager to see how it'll play out in the coming months and years. The notes I take on new substances I always keep to myself and, whenever I type up a report of the experience I use the notes as a basis and to remember and recall the experience. With this substance, however, I chose to go ahead and include my notes as I feel they best describe the experience. However, these notes start at the peak effects and really trail off without a closer so I'll summarize the coming-up and ending stages as appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
(T + 0)<BR>
<BR>
I placed 20mg of 5-MeO-DALT into an empty capsule and consumed it. I had just woken up about 30 minutes ago and hadn't eaten for about 12 hours. The substance itself is very clumpy and really reminded me of 5-MeO-AMT. The color was that of brown sugar and had a very, very potent chemical scent to it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
(T + 1 Hour)<BR>
<BR>
I had felt stimulated both mentally and physically and on the verge of the substance really taking hold for quite some time. I suppose having it in a capsule made it take a little bit longer to break down and become absorbed in my stomach.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
(T + 1 Hour 15 Minutes - 1 Hour 30 Minutes)<BR>
<BR>
During these fifteen minutes time slowed down quite a bit and I got a slight headache along with tension on the back of the neck that I usually get with psychedelics. It wasn't a real bother since I get headaches on a daily basis regardless. I had a little bit of those 'early morning munchies' so I ate a granola bar and it was quite delicious. I could definately feel the substance start to take hold, though it seemed as if it was leading to nowhere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
(T + 1 Hour, 45 Minutes - 4 Hours, 30 Minutes)<BR>
<BR>
[NOTE: The following are raw, unedited notes of what had taken place over the next four hours or so.]<BR>
<BR>
'The inexperienced becomes experienced very quickly...'<BR>
<BR>
Starting to almost feel as if I was finally starting to come up as I watched the outcome of Martha Stewart's sentence on MSNBC, I decided I'd take my dog out to the backyard and sit down for a few minutes. I ended up spending some 10 minutes outside while it seemed like it hand't been nearly as long. I found myself staring into some of the many trees in awe of their natural beauty and it seemed as though I could see every single leaf moving quite a bit all at once in my whole field of vision. I saw some birds that would stand so still and silent that I was beginning to question if they were real or not. My dog had been laying in the grass the entire time and constantly sniffing out the air appearing to be enjoying himself. For some reason, everytime I looked at him constantly putting his nose to the air and taking in scents I couldn't help but break out in laughter.<BR>
<BR>
I just came back from outside in my backyard and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed myself out there. Up until about 30 or so minutes ago, I was beginning to wonder if I'd ever feel any strong effects from this substance at all, but right now I'm really feeling confident in it and definately at a peak. I feel wonderful right now while I indulge in a granola bar listening to Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto remixes as of late. My body is filled with energy that's pulsating to the music's beat, not unlike the effects of using some popular stimulants of the day. The ceiling fan's breeze feels as if it's a wind at some 60 mph and I thoroughly enjoy every second of it's effect.<BR>
<BR>
For some reason my hunger remains, so I've just prepared some food I'm now letting cool. I feel really light on my feet and full of joy at the moment as I have for awhile now. My body still has alot of energy and I feel quite a bit of tension in my jaws that's making them want to clench, alot like MDMA.<BR>
<BR>
No matter how much food I eat I keep finding myself hungry. This is very bizarre for a 'psychedelic' I know, but I just can't stop thinking about it. As I walk around the house, I feel as if I'm floating from place to place. At the same time, as another person pointed out, I do 'feel as if I'm 10 feet tall' in a way. Music is still sounding extraordinarilly nice and reminds me of just how nice music can be on psychoactives. Although there really isn't much to speak of in terms of visuals at all, I do get the kind of 'metallic' taste in my mouth that one can experience with acid and other psychedelics.<BR>
<BR>
It's really hard to believe when I stop and think that I've only been feeling these peak effects for about 1.5 hours. My pupils are still heavily dialated yet visual activity remians virtually non-existant. Even leading up to the peak effects, and still to this point, my left nostril seems to be running non-stop. It's not unpleasant but just very odd, especially considering I haven't had a runny nose in some six months. I'm still feeling very nice and mentally entertained. I just spent the better part of the last 15 minutes out in the back yard again (though it literally seemed like an hour) admiring how cloudy it had become and hoping it would start raining. Birds were still flying about, to and from the feeders, with alot of beauty. I kept myself entertained with a huge canister of neon-blue colored silly putty I had purchased a few months back. It's literally more than two hands full and it was pretty amazing and fun to play with it while I was outside. Having been back inside again for the last few minutes typing this up, I can't help but feel hungry again. Very odd yet pleasant at the same time. I have come to a cunclusion that anything you'd normally find funny while in a normal, sober state of mind you'll find exceptionally funny on this substance at times. This, obviously, isn't a unique characteristic as many psychedelics tend to induce laughter.<BR>
<BR>
[End of notes taken during the experience]<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
(Summary)<BR>
<BR>
The experience was very pleasant and enjoyable. I definately think it will become accepted as one of those chemicals that has the positives outweighing it's negatives. I had no neausea throughout the entire experience nor any other side effects. The effects remained strong throughout the experience and went away very gently leaving me in a good mood and back at baseline where I've now been for about an hour and a half. The best way to sum up the peak effects within those 3-4 hours was feeling 'floaty' (especially when moving), in a very good mood with music sounding great with a constant energy flowing throughout the body. This chemical will make you want to get up and dance and even become quite sociable at times. The hunger aspect is very strange indeed, and it makes me wonder if the same will happen upon future experiments with it. I really, really do consider it more of a stimulant than a psychedelic though it really is a good mix of both. To my mind I very much felt like I was on a psychedelic (though rather clear-minded) but to my body I was very much stimulated. I'm sure as the day comes to an end and I goto sleep tonight I will have more to add later, but for now I hope all those interested in this chemical retain their interest and enjoyed reading this rambling-filled report.<!--   End Body   -->

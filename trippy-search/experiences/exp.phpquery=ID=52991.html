<!--   Start Body   -->


It all started when I was 11 years old I had been sexually abused numerous times by my dad and when I was 13 I was taken away from my family from then on I decided that my life was fucked at the age of 13 I became a drug addict, alcoholic, and a chain smoker it wasn't long before I became suicidal can I also please note that I was just angry about what happened with my dad.<br>
<br>
When I was taken away from my parents I was put with a couple only 19 years of age both of them because they were the closest relatives they let me do whatever I wanted and I ran wild.<br>
 <br>
At the age of 14 I became extremely depressed everything was going down the drain I wasn't been paid attention to and was running a muck of my self.<br>
<br>
Docs workers, counselors and what not all described me as a wild teenager so eventually I had docs chasing after me they made me go to a doctor who diagnosed me with Depression they put me on Zoloft for about 4 weeks and it did nothing.<br>
   <br>
When I first started taking it I was getting suicidal thoughts anxiety attacks and what not then it got worse I started wrist cutting every night and even in the day at school and then my suicidal thoughts became more severe. I had never ever thought about suicide I’ve always been a smart and sensible girl always getting Excellent grades so that’s when I realized the medication was doing something to me. Eventually everything came to much for me and on my 16th birthday I took a overdose of 24 Zoloft's and I was rushed to hospital I have very little memory of what happened that night I remember a beeping noise and the annoying ping known as a drip hurting my hand but other then that not much comes to memory.<br>
<br>
The next day I was seen by a psychiatrist I really wanted to go home so I made up some bullshit story that I was doing it to get attention from my biological parents which wasn't true at all cause I hate them.<br>
<br>
Anyways she started asking me stuff about my thoughts on suicide and I said that they only started happening when I started on Zoloft she didn't believe me and urged me to keep on taking them.<br>
<br>
The suicidal thoughts went on a week later I went to a mental institution for two days, then hospitalized for suicidal attempt for two days and then one day a week later I completely lost it and was again hospitalized for suicidal attempts this time for a whole week. They decided to start me up on Prozac because they were convinced that I was suicidal because of depression I told them numerous times that I was not depressed and I was just angry about everything but they were convinced so now I’ve been put on Prozac my suicidal thoughts are worse then ever and now I’m hearing voices, seeing things, More angry then ever I won’t leave my room unless its for school but other then that they can’t even get me to eat I’m convinced that I’m going to commit suicide.<!--   End Body   -->

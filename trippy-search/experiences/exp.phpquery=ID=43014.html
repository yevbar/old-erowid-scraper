My dad has had a problem sleeping for as long as I can remember, but it was only recently that he sought a pharmaceutical remedy. He'd done a lot of drugs in his day and so I guess he knew his blood because he never told me that he was taking Ambien. Regardless, I found one of the half-empty pill bottles on his dresser a while back. My friends had all tried it and said good things about it, so I figured I'd try it - if not for recreational use then to help me sleep.<br>
<br>
So a few days later, I took 10mg right before I went to bed. I was lying on my back, more or less trying to sleep, looking at the light coming in through the outsides of the doorway. It was after a few minutes of doing this, that I noticed the first effects. They came on pretty subtley at first, probably because I didn't know what to expect, but once they started, their severity increased very quickly. The first thing I noticed what that the vertical line of light coming from the hallway kept moving when I tried to look at it. I would stare at it for a second or two and then it would scoot off to the right. After several minutes of this I came to the realization that what was happening wasn't external and that it was just my eyes being unable to focus, but before I realized this, the experience was extremely surreal.<br>
<br>
This freaked me out a bit (in a good way) and so I decided to get up and walk around and see what else I could see. I wrapped myself in my comforter and went to the main room of my apartment and sat down. I looked at the table in front of me and it looked 'strange' in some way. I couldn't figure out what was wrong with it and I got bored and so I went to the balcony. This is when things got really weird.<br>
<br>
If you look down from my balcony, you can see this courtyard in the center of which there is this elevated brick circle with a white concrete perimeter. I was staring at just this, just sort of letting my mind wander, trying to see the 'strangeness' of it like I did with the table. And I did. Very subtlely, the white perimeter started to spin and levitate. I could 'make' it do this and it felt like something from a comic book. It would only last a few seconds before it would go back to where it 'normally' was, but every time I tried to make it levitate, it would go higher.<br>
<br>
After doing this for 20+ minutes and cackling loudly, I noticed I could see the 'strangeness' of the bricks in the middle of the circle. When I concetrated on them, they would go up and down, like waves or ripples on the surface of a lake. Like with the concrete perimater, the oscillations got more and more pronounced until the bricks seemed to be 15+ feet in the air. Keep in mind that I was about 50 feet up and so I was looking down at all of this. When they got to this height, I began to see patterns in the bricks. At first it was just a swirling inside them but eventually, they looked like people. Not really people, though. They looked like aliens to me. This was simultaneously hilarious and terrifying at the time and I decided it would be best if I just went inside and went to bed. I did this and got the best night's sleep I'd gotten in many years. I slept for 11 hours and felt completely rejuvenated. Normally I sleep for 2-5 and feel like shit.<br>
<br>
Before I end this, however, I should say a few more things. Ambien is really, really powerful. I did it several times after the above experience, but never had the hallucinations to such a degree again. Every time I did it after the first time, it hit me like a freight train within 15 minutes. The only thing I can compare it to is like getting more drunk than I've ever been in my entire life all at once. One time I took it while typing at my computer and about 10 minutes later I was literally drooling on my keyboard, completely unable to type anything.<!--   End Body   -->

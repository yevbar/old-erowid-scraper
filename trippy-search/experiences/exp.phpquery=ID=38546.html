Below is my 'breakthrough experience' on salvia.  I had tried salvia plain leaf, and it didn't do the trick.  So Extract it was.  I'll be writing this from my perspective.  First Person.  My thoughts and actions.<br>
<br>
It was a lonely Wednesday night when I tried it.  I loaded up my home-made bong with a one-hit-cashed load.  I lit my micro-torch lighter.  Inhale --- Hold.  Simple enough.  Anything?  Not yet.  So I loaded up another one-hit-cashed.  Exhale.  Light --- Inhale --- Hold.  Yeah, I'm feeling it.  Lightheadedness.  This isn't very exciting.  I'm sweating profusely.  I feel like I just got out of a shower.  I filled another one-hit-cashed bowl.  This would be my last one.  Exhale.  Light --- Inhale --- Hold.  And away I blew.<br>
<br>
I was stuck like concrete to the couch.  In a not so comfortable position I might add, as I was hitting a bong.  The bong in my right hand, smoke still in my lungs.  It felt like it had been forever.  Maybe I didn't have to exhale.  Maybe I would just keep it in until I passed out.  Didn't feel like it mattered very much anymore.  A body is just a body for christ's sake.  I am so separate from it right now.  I understand exactly where The Velvet Underground are coming from in the song 'Heroin'.  I still haven't exhaled.  It's only been about a decade though, so I should be fine.<br>
<br>
I was somewhere where time doesn't matter.  I was in a picture.  I had to stay still.  I had to hold my breath.  If I let it out I'll disappoint someone.  I don't know who, but someone.  My eyes zoomed out.  God is real.  Wow.  Hi God.  I think you're somewhere around here.  Or maybe you're everywhere like they used to say in Sunday school.  I don't really know to be honest.  Hey God, can I exhale?  I think my chest is going to implode.  I don't want to be bothersome or anything.<br>
<br>
--- Exhale.  Great.  Thanks.  Next thing I know I'm in a ball-park, but I'm not in it, I'm part of it.  I'm part of a postcard picture of a ballpark.  My postcard is being held by a hand with a white glove on it.  I think it might be God.  I think I'm getting scared.  I'm not really sure though.  I think I have a stomach ache.  Or maybe I can just feel my stomach.  Who really cares right?<br>
<br>
Damn.  I'm so far away from my body right now and I can't stop realizing it.  My stomach is somehow with me though.  What the fuck is going on and who am I?  Am I God?  No.  I'm part of God though aren't I?  Yeah.  I am part of everything.  I can see myself holding hands and my eyes haven't blinked.  I'm falling really fast but I like it.  It's really nice to go this fast.  I wonder if I'm in a convertible.  That would make sense.  I can't see anything anymore.  I can just feel everything.<br>
<br>
Religion is a controversy for what reason?  To satisfy the oddballs who need something to gripe about.  Hey, God.  Are you there still?  Well I don't actually know if you were ever there, or even if you ever will be, but I need to ask you a favor.  Are you listening?  I need you to make the picture a little smaller okay?  My eyes aren't that big.  I wonder if the size of your eyes control how much you can see.  Well, if not, maybe it's positional.  If so go ahead and just put my eyes in a more convenient location okay?  I really like seeing everything all at once like this.<br>
<br>
Fuck.  If everything is black does that mean my eyes are closed?  I can't tell.  Maybe I can.  No, I don't want to try.  I never want to just see my tunnel vision again.  I don't want to question my beliefs anymore.  Maybe I'm on heroin.  Naw, I don't think I'd ever do heroin.  What's heroin feel like?  Surely not this.  I'm on something I'm pretty sure.  I have to be.  Otherwise why can't my eyes open?<br>
<br>
Oh yeah.  ---rip---  Yeah.  I'm back.  Wow, and I thought salvia was a short trip. That took for-fucking-ever.  Oh well, worth ever minute.  Wait, holy shit.  I took it at 10:00 and it's only 10:19?  Amazing.<br>
<br>
I've done salvia many times since this and have had trips just as powerful as this one, though none near as religious.  I always feel as if I'm part of a big picture though.<!--   End Body   -->

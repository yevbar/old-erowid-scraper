My first salvia experience was using the plain dried leaves, then the 5x extract.  I used a homemade gravity bong. I loaded the bowl, lit the leaves and took a hit. I took several more, they were varying sized from smaller to heavier thick ones. I waited and wasn't feeling too much, save being a bit out of my head and euphoric. Somewhat like being stoned, yet different. I wanted to experience more, so I broke out the 5x and loaded it in the bowl. I took several good hits of that, then waited. Suddenly, BOOM! I was out of it. Beyond high, it was trippy. It's very hard to describe fully; when I try I burst out into incoherant sylables. <BR>
<BR>
I knew suddenly, I was no longer myself, I didn't know who or what I was. The feeling was very bizzare. Things felt like they were moving sideways and I felt like I was some kind of....book? Or a page, on a giant book big as the bed I was sitting on, bent back like a tent, and I was the page that kept turning and turning. I kept holding my arms and fingertips straight and placed them at angles agacent to each other. I began to realize what was happening, and I told my friend it was definetely working and to start recording with his cell as I laughed insanely. I was trying not to 'fold' for some reason. I'm not sure how long it lasted exactly, maybe a couple minutes, it wasn't too long, as I was coming down from it I began trying to explain what happened with hand gestures and stuttered excited rantings. I noticed no real visuals, other than the etheral perception that I was  that strange creature /object. <BR>
<BR>
Yeh, I would definetely try this again. The setting is important. Outside noises prove very annoying, even my friend making comments and jokes wasn't helping. I hope I see some visuals next time of some sort. But that first experience wasn't half bad, better than anything else I've tried. It will be a sad day if this good stuff becomes illegal.<!--   End Body   -->

This experience happened a little while ago when I was working a full time night shift job and a part time day job.<BR>
<BR>
I had just got off of work and decided that instead of sleeping for only a few hours before going to my next job later that night, I would stay up and go watch a movie. I have had much experience with sleep deprivation before and figured i could handle it.<BR>
<BR>
The whole day i felt really tired (which is to be expected) and by the time I had to go to work I was nodding off. I took a walk outside in the cold air and woke up a little bit. Things went pretty smoothly until i was almost done my night shift. <BR>
<BR>
It was probably 30 hours since sleeping that I noticed how slow time was going. All I could think about was sleeping (which is normal by then) and I had trouble concentrating. The only way to exlain what happened next was that it was like my mind fell asleep as my body stayed awake. Every few minutes I would *wake up* and realize where I was and what I was doing. Then a couple of minutes later it would happen again. This happened constantly for the last three hours of the night.<BR>
<BR>
This has happened a few times when I was stoned on different things...but not this extreme. I was getting scared that I was losing my mind. I was fine after a good nights sleep. <BR>
<BR>
I think the reason this time was so different is simply because I wasnt just going to class and staying awake, I had to do pysical work. Thats my theory at least. <BR>
<BR>
In any case I wont be pulling any more all nighters for a while...its just to much work.<!--   End Body   -->

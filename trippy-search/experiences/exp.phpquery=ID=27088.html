Age: 21<br>
Mood: excellent<br>
Duration: wait, it ended?<br>
<br>
I had an experience the other day; the day started like any other day, but was destined to be less than ordinary.  It’s a Saturday, but I wake up at 8am nonetheless, eager to immerse myself in the music of my morning.  I plan that evening to ingest approximately 20mg of 2C-I and to go to the birthday party for one of my friends.  A good day is in the making, so I spend some time relaxing, waiting for the festivities to begin.  In retrospect, I’m not entirely sure why I was waiting.<br>
<br>
The evening comes and I weigh out the magic powder; my scale is only accurate to 10mg, but I’ve found 2C-I to be relatively innocuous in the past and haven’t minded the variations in dosage.  <FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: For substances active at such a small dose, this measuring technique is particularly unwise. See <a href="../psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.html">related article</a>]</FONT><br>
<br>
A certain giddiness overtakes me as I swallow the gel cap, like the first touch before the foreplay begins.  I grab my MP3 player—I always need music—and make my way out the door.  Seems like I’m always passing through doors.<br>
<br>
The thirty minute train ride to the party is relatively uneventful, as I find that this particular drug takes a while to come on.  Still, the sound of the train and the people on it, it reminds me of something.  Perhaps something I’ve forgotten.  Soon, I arrive at the party.<br>
<br>
While at the party, I drank very little, but did smoke cannabis throughout the evening.  I find that the cannabis blends rather nicely with the 2C-I, as I almost start to forget that I’m tripping.  I’m surrounded by beautiful sounds and colors, even though very little has changed.  Pretty soon, I find myself drifting away from the younger people at the party and sitting with the older crowd.  I hardly move, save for my breathing, and I barely speak, but I listen.  I listen.<br>
<br>
'Third door on the right there.'<br>
'Yeah, you know, you just have to take out the trash.'<br>
'No, not that cake, the other cake.  Yeah, we sure don’t want none of THAT cake.'<br>
'Don’t you remember YOUR birthday?'<br>
<br>
These people at the party, they were speaking to each other, but they were also speaking to me, to you, to anyone who would listen.  I’m listening.<br>
<br>
'I dunno if I’m gonna show up for choir practice tomorrow.'<br>
<br>
They’re still talking, in fact.  I speak a few words, now, and hear myself saying the same thing.  I’m listening to myself.  I’m sitting, silent, unmoving, listening to myself.  A friend of mine convinced me to go to the party and I owe him my gratitude.  There are a lot of great people there and it would’ve been a real shame to miss it.  Peace to you all.<!--   End Body   -->

I met an interesting couple at a retreat in July. They gave me a write-up of their first experience with this substance. While I cannot vouch for its veracity, they both seemed genuine and honest.<BR>
<BR>
40 mg., synthesized TMA-2<BR>
<BR>
8 p.m. 40 mg. TMA-2 was dissolved in lemonade. Typical phenethylamine bad taste.<BR>
<BR>
8:20 Mild stomach agitation. Was it real, or was it because I read about 'brief intestinal cramps' in a TMA-2 trip report in PIHKAL?<BR>
<BR>
8:45 Plus one. Nervous, agitated energy. Eyes feeling glossy. K and I keep pacing around. Hard to sit down for more than a few minutes. Conversation between us flowing very quickly.<BR>
<BR>
9:00 Plus two.<BR>
<BR>
9:20 Plus three. TMA-2 takes hold.<BR>
<BR>
The thing I remember the most was the energized, nonstop conversation. We talked and talked and talked. There was a bit of the empathic buzz of  MDMA, but tempered a nice, unattached (in the Buddhist sense) lucidity. Heart-opening stuff, for sure, but in a different way than MDMA. This could be very effective in therapy. When I directed my vision in a concentrated manner the visuals appeared. They were very similar to 2CB visuals, but not as colorful -- morphing surfaces, shimmery 'heat' patterning on light-colored surfaces, some peripheral sparkling. Glowsticks, as always, provided a visual treat, as did a glowing Frisbee and fireflies leaving blurry light trails against the darkness. K's naked flesh feels electrically-charged and tingly against mine.<BR>
<BR>
The comedown was long. This stuff is still working at 9+ hours. Benzodiazepenes were just what the doctor ordered to facilitate sleep at 9 hours.  In fact, it took 2 administrations of Valium before we were able to get some rest. Sex was possible, but orgasm remained just out of reach (similar to MDMA).<BR>
<BR>
Woke up feeling fine. Slight foggy hangover, but that could be due to Valium and lack of sufficient sleep.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, our first experience with TMA-2 was very rewarding. This substance seems to enhance clear, intellectual communication and is also physically energizing without being enervating. Visuals are unobtrusive but can be<BR>
summoned with concentration, and can be interesting. During the peak it gets much more visually stimulating. Prepare for a 10+ hour ride. K and I both experienced fluttery stomachs, but mine also felt like imminent diarrhea on a few occasions (which never materialized).  The mild body load was certainly well worth the trip.<!--   End Body   -->

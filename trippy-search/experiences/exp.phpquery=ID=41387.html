Me and a friend acquired this chemical from an undisclosed internet company, came in 100mg bag and he smoked a little of it one night with a friend, so we had about 80mg left apiece.<BR>
<BR>
At about 2pm we split the dose and ate it. He didn't eat all his he left like maybe 8mg which he snorted afterwards, said it burned like hell.<BR>
<BR>
I felt a little tripped out, I giggled a little bit and felt awesome just like I do on LSD or Mushrooms, colors were bright after maybe 2 hours or so (this takes a little while to kick in, although we had just eaten). I saw a little bit of visual distortions, some things looked a little off for a seccond and then went back to normal, a wall moved on it's own once, I could make stuff move, but I can kinda do that when sober so it doesn't really count. There was a tenseness in our necks and our hearts were beating sort of fast, likly due to the Amphetamine in this compound.<BR>
<BR>
Food tasted exsquisite, music was orgasmic, lights were pretty, I was happy. The ocean looked cool.<BR>
<BR>
I dose pretty high on halucinagens, I do a full 1/8 of shrooms or more, 3 hits of acid or so, this was not very strong feeling, I would have liked it to be stronger It was sort of like 1 hit of good acid.<BR>
<BR>
It does last a long time, at about 11pm we went to a friends party, a drink or two proved to relax the tension built up from the TMA-6, but after 4 or 5 I was just drunk feeling with a little bit of giddyness. Sleep was fine for a little while, woke up after 8 hours and couldn't go back to sleep which is unusual for me though. <BR>
<BR>
I'll probably stick to my LSD.<!--   End Body   -->

I was taking two english classes and had many reports to write before the end of the quarter. After several days enjoying a certain ephedra product and typing papers, I noticed that I was having a hard time linking concepts together. It seemed that I could only think one sentence at a time and that I couldn't think up sentences that completed each other. This was probably due to a lack of interest in the topic, and mental fatigue. Whatever the case, my solution was to ingest some vinpocetine 5mg, found in a blend with ginkgo. I probably took no more than three pills, most likely two= 10 mg. It completely cleansed my lack of focus on concept building. <BR>
<BR>
Vinpocetine naturally gets me rattling off at the mouth. Also I have an almost physical connection with sound in its presence. It seems to increase my attention to sound, with a special affinity towards high frequency noises.<BR>
<BR>
Don't take Vinpocetine with Ephedra!<BR>
It made me temporarily deaf. The effect seems to come and go but under slight agitation, such as in a social situation, I lost my ability to hear. A pressurized feeling may be felt in the ears.<BR>
<BR>
I tried various ephedrine products to see whether it was the ephedra or the mixture I took. Its definetly the ephedra, if you wanna have a pressurized and deafening experience that can leave you with ringing ears matching the intensity of a black cat going off next to your head this mixture is for you. Oh yeah the experience is temporary, but can leave residual soreness. <BR>
<BR>
While this report may have excited you, there are some cautions I suggest as precautions in the presence of these two chemicals: <BR>
1. whatever you do don't stand on your head, this seems to be very damaging to the ears.<BR>
2. don't listen to loud music, it feels good, but may make the condition worse.<BR>
3. small amounts may be tolerable (no deafness), but large amounts of vinpocetine will bring it on.<!--   End Body   -->

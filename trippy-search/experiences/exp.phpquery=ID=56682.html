Wanted to share my first experience with Tryptamines with you because I felt like it was a quintessential DMT trip that Terrence McKenna describes. It has forever changed my view of the universe. I have gone back only a couple of other times since, but I will never forget the first.<br>
<br>
I had no idea what I was even getting into when my friend told me that he had some. I wanted to experiment & try something new. I told a friend & he said he could get some and that he tried it & it's cool. He came over later after getting about a 1/4 gram of it. I was told later it was synthetic. It was an orangish-yellowish powder. Another friend came over who had tried it once before. <br>
<br>
We all sat on the floor of my living room. I put in some Ozric Tentacles (good stuff for a nice psychedelic soundtrack). My other roomate was on the couch watching TV. We used a large dry glass bong (no water). We smoked a little pot before (which if I would have known what I know now, I wouldn't have wasted it.<br>
<br>
I'll never forget the intoxicating super duper head rush when I blew out my first hit. I've tried lots of other things & I thought that the headrush alone blew anything else away. I knew the very first one wasn't the proper dose, but I did get some nice visuals. The music sounded really good. I saw myself inside of a purplish colored pyramid. I remember looking around the walls. It was a hollow pyramid made of purple stone. I was looking at a star map on the wall. I know a little about astronomy & constellations, but the only thing I could realize was that I couldn't figure it out. It gave me the feeling that I was looking at a star map from another point in the universe besides earth. I soon came back to the room & was back to normal in very little time. I was still blown away, because I've tripped before, but never to this intensity.<br>
<br>
My roomate saw the look on my face when I did it & afterwards he was treating me like I was a lightweight (which he knows I'm not!). I surprised him & packed him a hit. He's not a huge tripper, so it was quite amusing to watch him with his brain flambasted across the wall after calling me a lightweight. <br>
<br>
The 2 other friends did a hit a piece. One of them didn't really talk about his experience. The other guy said he was in a spaceship with an alien next to him. He stood infront of a control panal with only 2 buttons on it & the alien kept telling him to choose 1. When he chose the one button he pressed it & was instantly back. I found this quite amusing. <br>
<br>
So the last of the stuff which was a good amount in comparison to the amount we were doing before. I still am in question as to my dosage. All's that I know is that it was the right amount. I remember looking at the glass chamber tube of the bong filling up with thick white smoke. My friend saw how much it was. I took all I could. After I handed him the bong I remember him saying see ya'.<br>
<br>
I closed my eyes as I blew the thick hit out. It tasted like the smell of taring/blacktopping the streets or mothballs & very pungent. I saw the very typical spiral galaxy pinwheel coming closer to me in total blackness. It reminded me of Spirograph and the lines of the chrysanthamum shape were redish in color (typical McKenna just how he describes it). I got closer to the center of the 'flower' & went through the center as I did I heard the woosh sound for the first time & I was immediately trasported to another dimension. I had no idea this was possible.<br>
<br>
I soon started going through the typical question many people experience at this time contemplating if I had died or finally fucked my mind for good, or if I was ever going to come back. I remember putting my hand on my chest & wondered if I had a heartbeat. I felt none. I wondered if I was breathing & couldn't tell. I quickly supressed my fears (I've never had a bad trip to date) and continued to observe what was going on.<br>
<br>
I was in a 3d glowing room that most people call the dome. It was very geometrical. The walls were all made of pusating multi-colored light. It blew me away how I really felt like I was in this place knowing that I was sitting on the floor with my eyes closed. All the sudden my 3d view had spun around to make me face to face with a catlike alien being. It was made out of the same pulsating light that the walls were made of. It reminded me of diamond-like cut facets. Each facet was a different vibrant pulsating cloro. The cat was all made up of these 'diamonds.' It looked straight at me. It seemed to me like I heard a telepathic voice coming from this cat being that said, 'What are you doing here? You're not suposed to be here. How did you get here.'<br>
<br>
At this point I was pretty amazed at what happened. I immediately opened my eyes & my friend was looking at me smiling with a look on his his face like 'ooooh, that one really got ya' good.' The hallacinations then began with my eyes open. I noticed a multicolored fractal-like paisly shape swirling in the corner of the room. It then began to grow & swarm until it had covered the entire rug. The enter rug then became a giant malestrom of infesting paisly swirls. I looked at the tv my roomate was watching & Chris Berman was doing Primetime. I remeber his voice cutting out like somebody was pulling the headphone jack in & out of my headphones had I been wearing headphones. It was like the audio was cutting on & off. I only heard broken parts of his speech as I watched his face until the only thing I made out at the end of his sentence was 'He could go all the way!' I laughed & decided to close my eyes again. <br>
<br>
Then, with my eyes closed again. I began to see thousands of psychedic patterns & tapestries apearing in front of my eyes. A sheet would quickly fall away & there was a new one. It seemed like I saw thousand of images of these 'Sheet dusting' images in very little time. Almost like when one sees their whole life replayed in a second or two. This continued until I started to come down. It was only 5 minutes but it seemed like it lasted for eternity. I opened my eyes & the only thing I could say to my friend was 'I'm never doing drugs again.' He laughed. I didn't keep that promise of course.<br>
<br>
All in all the experience was all I could think about for about a week. I immediately talked about what happened to my friends so I would remember it all. I felt 100% safe, and there are still a few people I'd like to turn on to DMT if they got the guts. I don't think there's any reason to be afraid. As far as 5-Meo or synthetic DMT goes, the only difference I seem to notice is that with synthietic DMT the trip takes in a lot more of the room & thing you just saw in a room. Enjoy...<!--   End Body   -->

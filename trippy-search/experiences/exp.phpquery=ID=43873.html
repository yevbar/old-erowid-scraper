I just got busted for possesion in Early December and I was grounded for a long time.Which means i stay in the basement. I have a nice basement its not the crappy scary one.I have my room and bathroom and videogames and all that stuff down there. It was a Thrusday nite and I was walkin outa work and one of my friends that works with me was outside and he asked me if i wanted a quarter of shrooms for $35. Of course i said yes,(i had to stay home all week during winter break alone.)So i got in his car and we went to his house and he was all paranoid, so he tried to make it as quick as possible. He ended up selling me 9 grams instead of a skinched 7 grammer, which was what i expected, but for $35!So i went home and i didnt' know when to do..<br>
<br>
With them so I finally desided when my parents go to Green Bay on Saturday. So i went out adn bought MGS3 to play all weekend cuz it had just came out. I ate the first 4.5g and knew it would be enough but i was REALLY bored and feelin crazy so i ate the other bag. Here we go now...... <br>
<br>
In about 20 min i started feeling all happy like nothing could hurt me, and i just felt like i was on top of the world,(1st Plateau.)Which lasted about 1hour and i didn't know what to think.Then it was about 1/2 later i started feeling sick. So i sat up and everything got dizzy and i got disoriented and dazed, (2nd plateau.)So i got up from the couch and walked in to the bathroom to pee,at first.While peein i stared at my wall because all these neon colors were shifting all around and it was messed up. Then all of a sudden i wasn't peein' it was like i didn't even go at all. So then i look in the mirror to see my pupils cuz i look so funny when i'm f*cked up.While staring at my eyes, in my periferal vision;which was looking at the stuff behind me in the mirror.It was swerving and pushing in and out.Then i'd turn around and it would be perfect, let me mind you i did this for about 45 min and not even realize the time(3rd plateau).On my way out of my bathroom my legs got week and i collapsed and puked in my toilet. <br>
<br>
I felt horrible then after about 5 min of that, i got up. Upon getting up i felt as if i was in a wind tunnel. My hair was all in my face and everything was rushing past me in a blur, my shirt was flailing around along with my pants. It was equivelent to sticking ur head out a car window going 85mph.(THE 4th PLATEAU)Some how I managed to get to the couch and at this point I'm just wondering why my basement is windy and how crazy it just was. So I layed down on the couch and everything fell silent even though Fight Club was playin on my TV no more then 4ft away from it.Then i put my hand on the ground and upon touching it shook like a ripple in a lake adn it made this amazing noise. I freaked out it was so vivid and couldn't hold that in. It was so crazy.<br>
<br>
When I looked away from it everything was distorted; the TV, my Mom's dollhouse, my hand, everything. I was flippin out. So i went in my room for 3 hours layin in my bed all wrapped up in blankets stareing at my doors because I felt like i needed to wait for someone. Its hard to explain I just knew.Then all of a sudden everything went black like in the THe Ramones video.Then I opened my eyes again and I was above my body looking down.I knew I had died and I wasn't scared because i just felt so good and I just sat on the chair next to my body for a bit then I closed my eyes and everything came back I was completely normal but I was at my upstairs dinner table, and to my recelection I never went up stairs. At that point i opened my eyes wide and just said, 'Whoa'. But it was all so quick and it didn't last long, and I wished it went slower. I took them at 8:00p.m., andi didn't know the time like i said before it seemed really short and it was 3:50 a.m.It was the most intense thing I've EVER done,and I've covered ALL the trippy Psyhcodellic stuff. I recommed doing it if u get the chance. I'd do it all over again.<!--   End Body   -->

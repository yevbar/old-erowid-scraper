<!--   Start Body   -->


My name is Jeremy, im 21 years old, back in September 2001, I'm hanging out with a friend of mine.  My friend uses a lot of Gravol and suggests I try it since I have allready experimented with DXM.  So we go to the London Drugs up the street and get a few boxes of antihistamines called Aller-Aide (Diphenhydramine Hydrochloride) in 50mg. tablets. At this time it's about 8:00 PM and I decide only to take 3 (150 mg.) as im very precotious.  Within an hour im fealing like my body is being lifted, and my mind begins to separate slightly from the physical.  Still though I was rather disatisfied and wanted more.  My friend says 'your supose to take it with vitamin C'.  Apparently vitamin C acts as a catalyst enhancer to the DPH. So we start downing the Dole pineapple and orange juices in my fridge.  But not only that, I reallize I have these packages of 'Emergen C' in the cubord.  These are packets of 1000 mg. powdered concentrated vitamin C you mix with water, it fizzes like carbonate and is like drinking acid.  I took 10 packs (10000 mg.). Plus 1000 from the juices. <BR>
<BR>
Enjoying the elating experience of the Diphenhydramine I decide to take the rest of the box plus 10 from another box adding up to (1500 mg.).  It's 11:00 now and me and my friend sit down and I begin to see visual images in my mind, which was perfect because im an artist and draw pictures from my visions.  Unable to speak to my friend every time he says something I am anoyed, I told him to go to sleep while I drew pictures from these visions.  My full dose haden't hit me yet, my hands were shaking, my vision blurry, mouth as dry as a desert, nasal passages feal like sand.  <BR>
<BR>
It starts getting late into 3:00 AM and can barely see anything, the whole room looks like it's a mile away, I look at my hand and it appears to be from a distance.  I can't even count how many times I got up for water, it felt like the only thing that could comfort me from this horror.  Laying down on my couch with blankets, the soft pillow feals hard as a rock, and when I touch the walls they feal as soft as a pillow.  At one point I was in a black hole looking at dark matter that appeared to be infinitely far away but yet right in front of me.  I whent into a gritty static zone where I heard grating metal and static in my brain.  I could taste metal on my tongue and my body felt like particles and wave static.  <BR>
<BR>
My heart was beating very fast and I thought I was going to die, going into the bathroom looking into the miror: my reflection was the real me looking back at the real me like I was inside the mirror and there were two of me.  I reallize I must try and throw up or I was going to die.<BR>
<BR>
So I stick my whole hand down my throat several times and nothing.  But eventually I started to spew.........what I was spewing freaked the hell out of me.  Blood and bits of clear thin plastic material and chunks of rubery burgendy stuff.  I picked up a piece of the rubery stuff and looked at it, I could barely see, but indeed, it was stomach lineing.  Pieces of stomach eaten away from the vitamin C acid overdose.  At this point my heart feals like it's going to stop.  I phoned my mother and tell her what I had done, she picked me up and took me to the hospital.  <BR>
<BR>
Im trying to speak to the doctor but my mouth is so dry as he asks me how many I took and when.  They took an electrocardiogram and a blood test, I was fine.  My stomach would replace it's lining and stomach pump was uneccesary.  But meanwhile in the hospital bed I left my body, the vitamin C had turned the Diphen. into an etheric experience.  I was actually hoping I would die because I could feal etheric white light, colored shapes in ether-dimensions, and angelic presences. I whent to a place out of my body in another dimension where I saw beautiful pastel colored shapes and architectures, their where alien type angels told me the vitamin C with the Benadryl was the reason I left my body and that without it I would have remained in the Dark-Zone of static.  I feel like the vitamin C was what made the Benadryl experience turn into an out of body experience.  This was simillar to doing DXM at 1200 mg. but much more lucid and intense.  It seemed to have plateaus just like DXM, the first was psychosomatic, blurryness, shaking, dry mouth and nasal passages. The second was like visual hallucinations and inner visions.  The third was like being in a Dark-Zone with static and grity metalic noise in my brain, combined with black holes and things appearing far away.  Then the fourth was pleasant, near death type experience with colored shapes and biomorphs, jelly-like pale blue angel-aliens  and pale pink blobs.  I want to do the experience again, only for the 4th plateau, but I never will, the Dark-Zone and vitamin C burning is not worth it.  Better off to stick with DMT or DXM.   <BR>
<BR>
I continued to use the Diphenhydramate later on, in 250 mg dosages and 1000 mg Vitamin C.  This is a much safer and pleasant dose.  On a side not, DPH was also good with DXM for it gives stimulus to the visual hallucinations.  <BR>
<BR>
Good luck (a be carefull) to all future travellers in the Dark-Zone Static and the Ethers.<!--   End Body   -->

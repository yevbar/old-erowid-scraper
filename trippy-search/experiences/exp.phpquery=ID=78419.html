My Background: Uneven level of experience with psychoactive substances. Experience with Marijuana, Nitrous Oxide, DXM, Alcohol, Benzodiazepines, Prescription Opiates, Modafinil and Mephedrone. No experience with MDMA or any true psychedelics (LSD, 2c's, Psilocybin, etc). Diagnosed major depressive disorder (managed well by medications), social anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder (managed somewhat well by medication)<br>
<br>
Prescribed medications: Bupropion (Brand Name: Wellbutrin; 250mg daily), Clonazepam (Brand Name: Klonopin; As needed, 1 mg at T-4:00), Pregabalin (Brand Name: Lyrica; 150mg daily)<br>
<br>
Set: Rather calm on the whole. Slightly nervous about the large number of people that I don't know at the upcoming party. I had eaten a rather large meal right before the party.<br>
<br>
Setting: Large party (~30 people) at the house of a friend whom I have known for ~5 years but have not seen frequently. Attending with me are two of my best friends, and aside from that I do not know anybody at the party.<br>
<br>
I arrive at the party at approximately 9:30 and promptly fix myself a drink (large screwdriver, approx 5 oz Vodka). Sit down and start to chat at a table outside with the people I already know. The party is very segmented and the groups aren't mixing very much. At approximately 10:00 I ingest about 200mg of bk-MBDB (AKA Butylone, Mebylone). I continue to drink my drink and smoke cigarettes (I am not a regular smoker) and do not notice anything for at least 30 minutes.<br>
<br>
T+1:00 I begin to notice the effects- I am far more interested in the conversation. I'm very eager to talk and I lean forward and start to become very empathetic. However, I do not 'feel' anything- brain and body seem at baseline. At this point a friend of the host who I had not known previously joins the table. I immediately strike up a conversation with him and become very interested in his background. This is quite atypical of me- it usually takes months after knowing someone before I am fully comfortable talking with them.<br>
<br>
T+2:00 At this point I can feel the effects a bit more directly. My attention is very easy to control, which is abnormal for me. I am feeling slightly speedy (similar to but less intense than Mephedrone). I am not feeling euphoria directly from the drug, but I find it very easy to take pleasure in things that I might otherwise miss- a new type of cigarette, the cool breeze, the candles on the table, the night sky, etc. Everything is very soft and pleasurable, and I am quite content sitting down and receiving pleasure from everything around me. For around an hour I am very deep in conversation with a female friend (no love/sexual interest- she is my best friend's girlfriend). I feel very concerned for some of her problems, and I become very open about my past and find it very easy to come to conclusions about my history and I am very eager to inform her of this so that it may be of use to her. This is all very unusual for me, as I find it hard to be empathetic and I especially have a hard time analyzing my own past and personality. During this entire time I drink quite a bit of water- I estimate that I drank at least two liters of water throughout the night.<br>
<br>
T+3:00 My friends decide to go to the back yard of the house to smoke some marijuana, and I follow. The inside of the house is largely empty, and as we pass through the house there is one girl in the kitchen. I have not met her before, but I instantly approach her and tell her my name and ask what her name is, and I am genuinely interested in getting to know more about her, and invite her to come back with us (she declines). Again, this is atypical of me- I am usually extremely shy around attractive females that I do not know. At any rate, we smoke some marijuana in the back yard- I only take a hit or two, and I am not particularly interested in it, nor have I had any alcohol since my first drink about 4 hours ago.<br>
<br>
T+4:00 (2:00 AM) My friends and I decide that we should go on a walk, perhaps to a local strip joint or to get some food at nearby diner. The four of us are walking along, and I am very engaged in conversation with all of them. I walk much more slowly than I usually do, and am observing small things that I find beautiful (trees, lawn ornaments, litter on the side of the road) as well as taking in the cool night air and the clear sky. Occasionally we pass people on the sidewalks or people on bicycles on the road. When we near them, I jump at the opportunity to say hello and ask how they are doing. I have an intense desire to befriend everyone I see, and feel the urge to invite them all with me. I do not get the opportunity, however, because they all continue on their way despite my conversation. During this time I am quite awake, but my mind and body feel relatively normal, perhaps a bit excited. I liken it to 11:00 AM after a good night's sleep and a cup of coffee. <br>
<br>
T+4:30 We arrive at the diner, which is quite crowded. Luckily, we are able to immediately find a table. Compared to the single people outside, I have no desire to befriend or engage with any of the people in the diner. It is brightly lit, crowded, very loud and this makes me slightly uncomfortable. I have no desire to eat, but drink a large amount of water and a milkshake. While my friends are eating we continue to be engaged in very deep intellectual discussions (the history of the Middle East and Africa, specifically the ripple effects of colonialism and the cold war on the current state of affairs), which is not too out of the ordinary for us. The only person that I bond with at the diner is our waiter, who I am extremely complimentary of, but who is very busy and does not have the time to talk to me.<br>
<br>
T+5:30 We arrive back at my friends' house, and everyone has gone except for the roommates of my friend. I hadn't met them at the party, but I meet them here and encourage them to join us on the front porch. Again, they decline. We continue our conversation on the back porch and drink and smoke cigarettes. I drink another small screwdriver (approximately 2 ounces of Vodka) very slowly.<br>
<br>
T+6:00 While I continue to be very chatty and quite awake, my friends decide it is time to head home, as it is about 4:00 AM at this point. We bid farewell to the friend who lives there, and my other friends proceed to drive me home. The drive is short, but I immediately engage in yet another deep conversation, which continues until we arrive at my house. It takes great effort to end the conversation and get out of the car- I feel quite sad with my good friends leaving me behind. I go inside my home and my girlfriend is asleep, but has to wake up in 30 minutes to take someone to the airport. I decide to stay up until then, biding my time by walking my dog. The walk was very peaceful, and the neighborhood was incredibly quiet. The walk was almost meditative in its quality.<br>
<br>
T+7:00 I end up driving my girlfriend and the person she has to drop off to the airport, as I am sober at this point, but still quite awake. I'm very talkative on the way back in the car and after we get home. I don't feel like going to sleep, but my girlfriend does and we agree to do some nitrous to help me to pass out. That works and I'm able to go to sleep without much effort at about 6:30 AM (T+8:30).<br>
<br>
The next day: I sleep about 4 hours, wake up feeling quite refreshed. No hangover of any sort. I meet with friends and family later in the day and I'm still quite outgoing and chatty the whole day. Went to sleep at about 11:00 PM that night with no difficulty.<br>
<br>
Conclusion: I had quite a good time and I think quite highly of this drug so far. However, I definitely understand why it is not more popular and why some people might not like it. bk-MBDB is not a rave drug- if I had been in a rave I would have been extremely uncomfortable, mostly because I wouldn't be able to talk to other people. This drug is suited for small get-togethers where conversation is the main goal. It helped quite a bit in getting to know new people and in establishing a tighter bond with people I already knew. I am, however, somewhat concerned that I might have been overbearing or too eager, which may have explained the consistent rejection of people whom I invited to join our little group. Subsequently, I plan to take this drug recreationally quite often in the future, but maybe in lower doses, and I will definitely be more aware of my actions so that I do not scare off people who are not expecting such an open and warm person.<!--   End Body   -->

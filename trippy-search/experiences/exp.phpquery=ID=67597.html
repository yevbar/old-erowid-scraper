<!--   Start Body   -->


DMT has been a troublesome substance for me. It captured my imagination like perhaps no other psychedelic ever has. Even if it is not true, as Strassman and various others have suggested, that DMT is responsible for dreams and/or spiritual experiences in the human brain, still DMT is something that dreamers and spiritualists must obsess over. The mere possibility that a drug could reliably induce contact with alien entities, a godlike consciousness, or an alternate plane of existence is startlingly profound. So I was quite surprised when my first couple of times smoking DMT turned out to be rather uneventful. DMT has grown on me slowly, and it is only just now, after several uses, that I’m starting to find satisfaction with it. <br>
<br>
5-MeO-DMT has been a useful alternative in the meantime, and a great partner substance to explore. Where breaking through can be a battle with DMT, 5MD offers fairly guaranteed profound results. I feel that it is an easier psychedelic to use, but probably with less overall depth. On this particular day of experimentation, I started with 5MD.<br>
<br>
At around 2:00PM on a day early in December, I find myself home alone with a couple hours to myself. I locate my tryptamine vaporizing kit, which consists of a series of separate glass bulbs dedicated to various tryptamine substances I smoke. This prevents the chemicals from getting mixed with one another as puddles of residue build up. The DMT and 5MD pipes are layed out side by side. First a very small sample of light-yellow 5MD freebase powder is selected to warm up with.  Estimated dose is 5 milligrams, but I confess that these are not scale-measured doses…  consider them approximated.<br>
<br>
The powder is lit, liquefies, and initial burnoff smoke is allowed to clear out as the flame is drawn away. Lighter flame returns, 5MD puddle transforms into a light whisp of smoke that I suck up into my lungs. As I hold the smoke, there is mild pulse elevation, and a warm sensual body rush. I exhale and enjoy the solitary feeling of euphoria. There are negligible visuals, but great musical appreciation.  After a few minutes it is already fading fast.<br>
<br>
Now I insert my scoop into my 5-MeO-DMT sample and pick out a solid, crystallized chunk of 5MD freebase. I estimate the selected crystal as being about 20 milligrams. I load it into the stem of my pipe and it tumbles down to the bulb in one solid piece. The flame transforms it into a puddle. The chamber fills, the smoke is held for about 6 to 8 seconds, the rush can be felt even before exhaling. I set the pipe down and settle into a feeling of bliss. There is light visual movement all around, things shining and shifting about just barely. I feel the propellant body rush of 5MD, a feeling like being stretched out or pushed through a tunnel… and I decide that the feeling is euphoria. And so it is. <br>
<br>
In this critical moment of every 5MD trip, set and setting come into play. The feeling in the body that 5MD produces is neutral, but very powerful. Every time it sets in, my mind asks, “what is this feeling?” There are two possible answers: “danger” or “euphoria”. The correct answer is euphoria, of course, but there is only a split second to choose it. And if my surroundings were too uncomfortable, the right choice might become impossible to make, in the split-second that I have to make it. I made the right decision this time. I turned my music off to allow a perfect moment of peace, quiet, and euphoria. Euphoria is the feeling an eagle has as it soars through a clear blue sky. A feeling of freedom which I embody as I sit here, soaring without ever leaving my chair. Euphoria is the right dose of 5MD at the right time and place. <br>
<br>
The trip had primarily ended after about five minutes. My pulse remained elevated for another 20 minutes. Once my pulse and my mind had both returned to normal, it was time to give DMT a try.<br>
 <br>
A scoop of DMT freebase was loaded into the appropriate pipe. The DMT was a fine, yellowish powder with a sandy appearance. The dose was estimated to be about 30 milligrams. I first melted the clump of powder down, letting it cool and harden into a puddle. As I re-applied the flame, I could see a delicate balance forming between the distance I held the flame from the DMT puddle, and the amount the puddle bubbled and gave off smoke. Just a millimeter closer and the flame would burn the puddle, changing its color and corrupting the effects. Just a couple millimeters further away and the puddle would cease to give off smoke. I felt my lungs filling with DMT smoke, which seems slightly harsher than 5MD. My lungs filled up, and I held the smoke in. <br>
<br>
After about 10 seconds of holding the DMT smoke, I was hit by a strong psychedelic body rush. Every bit as strong as with the large dose of 5MD I had smoked earlier. I felt compelled to put my pipe down, as it seemed like I did not need more. There was a sinking feeling as I did so, like the whole room was being pushed down by a wave of colorfully fluctuating energy that sank down from above… I sat back and closed my eyes. <br>
<br>
I can’t say exactly what I saw just then. It looked like numerous smooth streams of light in many different colors, drifting across a blank, open void. The vision was extremely three dimensional: The light streamers seemed to emphasize a great space, perhaps far larger than the room I was in. And there were numerous little particles being carried along in the flow, ambiguous objects like stars or planets.  I was witnessing a simulation of cosmic movement:  the migration of a living system. Something that might have been a galaxy was passing through the middle of my living room. It was difficult to tell exactly what I was seeing, as the complexity of it was extraordinary. <br>
<br>
I opened my eyes, and the moving lights and colors were vaguer… the streamers were still there, crossing through the room, producing illusory sensations. And underneath it all I could still see my surroundings. Underneath it all I was still in reality; in my room, in my body and in my mind. I was conscious of my surroundings, but the heavy body rush and startling visuals made me feel compelled to sit down, close my eyes, and wait. I sensed my presence in this place, with these streams of light and expanses of darkness all around me. At one point I felt overwhelmed, so I reminded myself that everything would return to normal soon. And in a few minutes, it did.<br>
<br>
Now I’m beginning to see the magic of DMT. What it produces is brief, difficult to explain, and worthwhile to investigate. I don’t know if I have fully broken through yet, but I believe DMT will have a great deal to show me in the future. For now, this is enough for me. I haven’t seen any entities yet.  But I saw galactic movements, and they were beautiful.<!--   End Body   -->

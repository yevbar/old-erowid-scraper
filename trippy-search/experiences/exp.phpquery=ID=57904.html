My first encounter with MDMA was on a saturday afternoon, around 5 oclock.  My friends A and R picked up three tablets from our supply, and we all met up at R's house.  <br>
<br>
We had originally planned to take the pills that night, later on around 8 or 9.  Since it was our first time, we wanted the experience to be as safe as possible (no parents).  When R discovered that he couldn't have us stay over that night, we decided to take the pills then.  We went into R's basement and all ate our pill.<br>
<br>
I started to get pretty anxious after about 10 minutes. I hadn't really heard much about the drug, just a few friends I knew that had taken it had told me about it.  I hadn't heard anything bad about it though, so I was just excited for the effects to come on.<br>
<br>
At about T+20min, the effects started to kick in.  I had only eaten a bagel around noon that day, so I was taking the drug on an empty stomach.  R found that the effects hit him hours later, and he had a full stomach.  So tip #1, take this drug hungry.<br>
<br>
The first effects of the drug that I felt were a slight lightness and occasional waves of euphoria.  I was relaxed, content, and in a good mood.  <br>
<br>
A, R, and I decided to go for a walk around R's neighborhood, on bike paths and such.  At about T+30min, we were all really ancey, energetic, and just excited.  We stepped outside and began walking around. <br>
<br>
At first, I didn't feel much different.  The heavy effects hadnt hit yet, but I knew that.  And I didn't have to wait long...<br>
<br>
T+35min: I started to feel some more intense effects.  At this point, I was more energetic than before, and I was talking a lot.  It reminded me almost of a mild cocaine experience I once had, same setting, same two people.  <br>
<br>
T+40min: Wow.  All of the effects I was feeling a short while ago just multiplied by 20.  I felt a sheer love for my two best friends. I thought about their details and the reasons I hung out with them, and I looked at it all in positive manner.  These were what my emotional effects were like.  I appreciated everything so much more, and felt like no matter who crossed my path, be it my worst enemy, I would get along with them. I would only focus on their positive traits, and I would like them no matter what they did to me in the past or at that moment.  I felt so connected to the world and it's people that it wasn't even funny.  <br>
<br>
T+45min: During our walk, A, R, and I decided to visit our highschool, which was right down the street.  Upon arrival, I looked at the building and said, 'Wow, this is where i spend 7 hours a day.  This is the reason I wake up at 6 AM every morning.  This is why I've slaved hours into the night to finish a paper or project.  This place must be important or something.'  At that time, I would've done all the math problems and english papers I had to do.  I just felt like school was good, and that in a classroom with my peers is where I belonged, and let me say, that is not my normal mindstate.  <br>
<br>
We walked over to the track/turf field and there was a girls soccer game taking place.  On any other day, watching girls soccer would sound like a great idea, but we were so full of energy, restlessness, and dehydration that we just decided to get a gatorade each from the vending machines and leave. <br>
<br>
T+1hr: A, R, and I decided to walk to a park nearby.  There, we met up with A's ex girlfriend, and still close friend, K.  A & K shared a hug, which seemed extremely heavenly at that moment.  I was in such a good mood that I actually asked my best friend A if I could hug K as well, to which he implied.  I hugged her, and it was great.  <br>
<br>
T+1hr 30min: R's peak had just set in, finally, because of his full stomach.  He and I decided it would be cool to let A and K socialize.  So, we went to a baseball park nearby and ran laps. <br>
I don't even like running in gym class.  Track is a joke to me.  but the moment I started running across the field, it became like a whole new hobby.  I felt like I was GLIDING rather than taking steps.  Actually, I felt like I was flying.  When I ran, I couldn't even tell that I possessed legs.  Without looking down, it was as if my body was flying across a plain, like my brain power was controlling it.<br>
Shortly after, I decided to jump.  Jumping was almost as fun as running, because I felt like I was jumping so much higher than I actually was. <br>
<br>
T+1hr 40min: We all decided to leave the park.  K gave A, R, and I a ride back to R's house.  When we got in the car at first, it felt weird.  When K started driving, it felt even WEIRDER.  The car seemed to accelerate very quickly.  It seemed like it was going faster than it was.  I could almost compare the car's takeoff to the start of a high drop on a rollercoaster.<br>
<br>
T+2hr 30min: After being dropped off, hanging out at R's house for a while and coming down, I had to leave.  I went and ate dinner with my dad.  I wasn't rolling anymore, that part only lasted about 2 hours, maybe less.  However, I was extremely talkative with my father, and I never am.  I was being really nice to him as well, talking to him about his girlfriend problems, meanwhile I've disliked most of his girlfriends.<br>
<br>
Ecstasy is the funnest drug I've ever taken.  This report is on my first time taking E.  I liked it so much that I took one the next night as well, and then the week dragged until Thursday where I did it again, and Friday.  Four times in a week, that is my extent of ecstasy experience.  I must say, each and every one was worth it. <br>
<br>
On my Sunday night experience, I smoked mad weed after my peak ended.  And I swear, the effects of the E went right back up.  Everything felt like I was rolling again.  It lasted a good half hour too.<br>
<br>
I think it takes a lot to build up a tolerance to E.  You'd have to take more than one in a day several days in a row.  Otherwise, doing a pill once a week or something like that will still make you roll motherfucking balls.<!--   End Body   -->

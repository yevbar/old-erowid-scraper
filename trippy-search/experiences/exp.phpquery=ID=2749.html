Well, I live in Berkeley, which is very close to San Francisco. I'd heard a lot about Salvia, but from what I understood, it was kind of hard to get your hands on and also a bit on the expensive side. Anyways, I went to Haight-Ashbury one day and was surprised to see that head shops were selling it for about $3 for a small baggie. Of course, I bought some just to see what all the hype was about. <BR>
<BR>
When we got back later that evening, my friend and I decided to fire it up. We went outside onto my patio where it was nighttime and there was some light from the moon. Mixing it in a 1:1 ratio with weed, we put it in the bowl of the bong and smoked it. After a couple of minutes, I felt a bit more paranoid than I typically am while high. After a few minutes, I wasn't absolutely positive that I could attribute my feeling to the Salvia (it was kind of subtle), but I knew that I normally didn't feel this.<BR>
<BR>
Then, I felt something that was quite scary - and although I remember telling myself that it was completely irrational to be scared of it - I couldn't shake the feeling. It was the feeling that behind me there was a huge swirling vortex/black hole that was coming closer and closer, about to suck me in.... Of course, when I turned around, there was nothing there - but as I was looking behind me, it suddenly felt like it was behind me on the other side (always behind my eyes, perpetually out of view, where I could never see). My friend noticed my unease and told me to relax. I was uncomfortable and a little paranoid for a while, but really that was it. My friend didn't get the same experience, he just said he was in an unusually contemplative state for a few minutes.<BR>
<BR>
Another friend of mine later told me that she had the same experience as me (she didn't know about my experience when she did it, though). Anyway, it was a mildly frightening experience, but I basically dismissed it as my mind's fear of the unknown, or fear of what I couldn't see....<BR>
<BR>
 I've done it a few more times with similar but less frightening results. Salvia is OK, I'd do it again, but honestly, I don't really get a lot from it, entheogenically speaking. Give it a shot if you want - I don't think it was anything that scarred me for life. :)<!--   End Body   -->

<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Warning: Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage.  We have chosen to include reports like this to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</FONT><BR>

Last Weekend I was stuck at some relatives' house with no pot, no DXM, no nothing.  I was bored and decided to try something really easy to get.  I rumaged through the house and found some Scotch Guard Fabric Protector in a red plaid looking can.  The back said deliberate inhalation is harmful.  So of course I tried it.  I sprayed some onto a rag and I put it up to my nose.  I huffed in a lungful very slowly, as it was very sharp in my nose.  I repeated this about 4 times and then I put the rag down.  I then had an experience very close to a Nitrous Oxide buzz.  I heard a helicopter and I saw like only 5 frames a minute.  I kept looking at my hands and wondering why they were hands.  Their was mild euphoria.  It ended in about 30 seconds.  After that I laid down and went to sleep.  <BR>
<BR>
Then I woke up the nezt morning and did it again.  Then an hour later I did it again.  Then in 30 minutes.  Then in 10.  Then again.  Then again.  It got to where I was just sitting with the rag, spraying on the spray and huffing, then repeat.  It was scary.  I eventually had to cut myself off as I was getting scared of brain damage and the rapid addiction that had formed.  I went back home the next day and I haven't touched the stuff since.  I still feel a little slow and I am coughing quite often.  I am sure it caused irreversible brain damage.  This is the only inhalant besides nitrous I've done.  It is strange and not at all fun.  I've had a lot of experience with pot, and use DXM occasionally.  This was something completely new to me.<!--   End Body   -->

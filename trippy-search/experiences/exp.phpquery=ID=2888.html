<!--   Start Body   -->


The night began with a severe smoke down. I recently received a new glass pipe which I instantaneously dubbed, 'Regis Fillmore,' as it it needs to be filled more. And that is my final answer. Well, soon afterwards that chemically induced lightbulb sparked above my noggin and said, 'it's a good time to imbibe some 5MEO-Dipt.' Being the slave to suggestion that I am, I soon found myself snorting 18 mg of the tan crytal powder. It went in easy but soon began to burn that all chemical acknoweldgment of what has just transpired in those heaving canals. The drip was icky and profuse but it all passed after a glass of lemonade. <br>
<br>
Time: 10 PM start<br>
<br>
Within 20 minutes I feel a certain Ketemine like feeling, very dreamish. I feel incredibly light and fluid (and I weigh 280 lbs.!) I dance around my bedroom like a pixie, listening to Terence Mckenna spout mushroom truth and dmt prophesies. After much body movement, I feel the imp of masturbation creeping up upon me. Sneaky little bastard. Always underhanded :) Needless to say the enhancement of said activities was exilerating, uplifting and consuming. A Human twicting Machine. 5Meo-Dipt-ah-dee-doo-dah!<br>
<br>
(T 1:30)<br>
<br>
Thus far into the ordeal, I've been having a pleasant yet laid back experience. Between yawns, I remeber having taken 2 mg clonazepam earlier in the eveing. This could account for the dreamy aspect of the trip so far. Just lying, snuggled up in my bed covers, feeling every inch of skin glow against the fabric, is fantastic. Very sensual, almost like a massage for the etheric body. All the while, I am trying to tune my mind to the theta frequency, listening to theta frequencies imbedded into various classical music. This part stretches out into daydreaming with intermittent bouts of self doubt etc. This is the point where I am always found grasping at the intellectual need to accept these doubts and dreams as parts of a whole, namingly me. Yet where the intelect knows best, the emotions waltz away to their own strange dance. Aloneness is where I am entering. A gap between personality and true being...ugh. <br>
So many knots to tie and not to tie and all the while trying not to become toungue tied.<br>
<br>
(T 3:00)<br>
<br>
At this point, I am reletively back to baseline. Still cloudy feeling, but comfortably so. At this point, I grind up some dmt containg root bark (Mantis Root) and decide to mix it up with some Blue Lotus Flowers and smoke the admix. A very stoney mindset ensued. I've done 5meo-dmt once before and this was reminicent of a low grade exposure. It was a decent replacement for my now non-existnet pot. At this point I find myself orbitting my personal dilemas somewhat, not despairingly, but as a child who, while playing with his action figures, understands the inherent drama of life and its comical pointlessness. He laughs, he groans, the are fight scenes and then the action figures begin to make out. Oh Scarlet, Oh Duke.... Welp kiddies, it seems that it is time to go punch the clown again. And may it be said, it was in the cause of scientic exploration. FOR SCIENCE!<br>
<br>
(T 3:30)<br>
<br>
Feeling energeeeeeezus! Similar at this point to some extacy tabs I've taken in the past, after the rush. I just popped 15 more mg. into a gelcap and swallowed it with the lemonade. We'll see what comes of this. Thank god for three day weekends from work.<br>
<br>
So far I've notice a very limited degree of mental engagement with this substance. It appears to be primarily tactile and empathy geared. Occasionally visual, sometimes intense, other times weak trails. There is a definite physical rush aspect that manifest itself in my sternum. It feels both warm and cool at the same time somehow, but pleasant. It is definitely conducive to falling into my groove while listening to some Isotope 217. Lotsa of head bopping and body movement-enjoyment. It's good to use my body for fun once in a while, not just as a vessle that transports me from work to home to drug dealers house to bed.<br>
<br>
(T 4:00)<br>
<br>
The booster crows. I am feeling the affects of a new day rising, in other words the swallowed 5meo-dipt is beging to spread some light into my jaloppy brain. My cheeks feel flushed and tingly. My thoughts are in that precious Beevis state, where every passing of gas has both spiritual and comical importance. Perfectly dumb is how I feel, no responsablities, no answering, just pure unadulterated festering in one's own ooze, a hot tub for the soul.<br>
<br>
(T 4:45)<br>
<br>
More smoking admixture. Some stoniness as before. Somethng is missing from that mixture, but not sure what. I'd rather find something that is not marijuana to fill that gap. Leonotis Leonorus flowering tops may be the answer here. Good clean high feeling from smoking the flowers.  Might synergize with the blue lotus, mantis root admix?<br>
<br>
(T 5:30)<br>
<br>
Winding down now. All in all it was a worthwhile ride. I wish it had somewhat more of a mental component as I enjoy the subconscious slips of overactive wordings induced by acid. But definitely introspective on the bodily level, I could focus on areas of my body with ease and work on releasing bound up tension. Sleep will be a while off, I can feel it. Time for some Blue Lotus Tea. Good to induce sleepy, nap time feeling. G'nite.<!--   End Body   -->

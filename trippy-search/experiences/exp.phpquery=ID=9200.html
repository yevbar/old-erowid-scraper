Ritalin is a stimulant, prescribed to those with ADD or ADHD which for some reason slows them down.  I decided to experiment with it as an upper, since I am not afflicted with either condition and like the stimulant affect.<BR>
<BR>
My first dose, 2 10mg tablets, had almost no affect, but then I'm an old speed freak from way back used to 1/2 gram at a time. I hadn't done anything except ephedra and coffee/tea for 10 years.    <BR>
<BR>
Next dose, I tried 4 (40mgs) and I got quite a buzz, just like a good clean strong cup of tea buzz at first, but after about 3 hours of working around the house and coming up with neat ideas for projects, I realized I was stimulated to quite some degree. It was noticeable to my husband.<BR>
<BR>
I attend college, so I tried waking up and popping just 20 mgs. (don't want to get too talkative or blow it) and I felt nice and peppy driving to school, but the drive is 45 minutes and by the time I got to class I was alert but that could have just been me.<BR>
<BR>
I've just started snorting it after reading a post of someone who did - I tried just 10mg. (one pill) at first.  It tasted way horrid (as stuff usually does going into your mucous membranes).  Nothing happened!  So I tried two, and the affect was nice, uppy but not too much.  There is a tolerance factor, though, and if I have had more than 50-60 mg. in one day, 10mg or 20 more won't do anything.<BR>
<BR>
To date, taking into account tolerance factors, and stupidity to do this in the first place, my daily routine is as follows:<BR>
<BR>
5 or 6 a.m. - pop 20mg (on workout days I perform my resistance training no better, but it is less painful and more fun)<BR>
<BR>
10:00 p.m. on campus - one or sometimes 2 more 10mg to get me through to the end of classes at 2 p.m. - Not enough to make me seem high but I don't get the mid-afternoon crash affect even in boring classes.<BR>
<BR>
3 p.m. - either during the drive home (again, it's 45 minutes) or just when I walk in the front door, I pop 30 mgs - then it's study time and I do mean study time - no problem focusing like with speed except one time, and that was when I took 40 mgs just to see what would happen. I started following every strand of my (now brilliant) thoughts until I had blown hours on worthless net surfing, with barely anything to show for my classwork.  <BR>
<BR>
I did research on this drug, as I didn't want to die of a heart attack or have a stroke.  I'm 20 years older now than when I used to shoot speed, and my body is therefore probably 40 or more years older than that! What I found out about dosage is that doctors prescribe UP TO 80 mgs. per day, of course spaced during a 12-hour period, for adults. <BR>
<BR>
I also checked out OVERDOSE information, and if I get the pinpointed eyeballs and accelerated heart rate with sweating and muscle tics or seizures, well then obviously I've overdone it.  <BR>
<BR>
To sum up:  For an occasional study session when you don't want the coffee grumpies, but need that extra concentration to pull a good paper or assignment, it's okay. Just be careful.<!--   End Body   -->

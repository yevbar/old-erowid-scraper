A girl I work with told me she had some good pills. She said they were 'codeine coated morphine'.  I had never heard of it but was curious.  After research I found that they were generic for MS contin made by Watson.  So I got 3 and ended splitting them with two friends.  We took them at ten o’clock and after about twenty minutes the first effects were coming, keep in mind that around 9:30 I smoked a blunt, and my friends felt the same way.  At about 10:30-10:40 I had my first wave.  It was a wonderful feeling I just felt like I weighed a ton and that I was I going to sink through the chair.<br>
<br>
Around 11, the buzz had kind of gone away.  I still felt it, it was just a little weaker.  We thought it was because we only took one. We decided to smoke a joint, and right about the time I got high the second wave of morphine came. And then I just went off into nothing. I could think of things to say to my friends but they wouldn’t come out.<br>
<br>
Now, at about 11:20, I’m sitting outside in a camping chair stargazing with my head leaned back.  I also tend to be smoking a lot of cigarettes (almost chain smoking) but it just helped my buzz so much. After a couple more waves I decided to go home. I had thought that I had come down but then I smoked a bowl and that just brought it right back for about twenty minutes.  I also had a very dreamy sleep, it was a very nice buzz.  They were 30 mg but the company makes them up to 200mg so I will definitely go for a bigger dose next time.<!--   End Body   -->

Salvia Divinorum 10X<br>
<br>
Full on Trip<br>
<br>
I put about on third of a gram in a bucket bong and lit it with my crème brulee torch and slowly drew the bong up filling it with thick light brown smoke. I continued until it was all burnt and was completely drawn up. This was slowly inhaled, which burnt at first. I stopped and took a little air, then I continued and took it all down in one. It felt as if I could hold my breath forever, I held it probably for about thirty seconds although I think I could have easily pushed it over a minute which usually I couldn’t do without some effort, but I was unsure of the intensity so I let it go.<br>
<br>
I decided I wanted to get a kind of sexual rush and already had a copy of club magazine opened on a beautiful page with a gorgeous couple of lesbians touching each other. So I picked it up and went and sat down on the sofa, I didn’t feel all that turned on and wasn’t erect or anything. I just wanted a nice visual to take in, and hopefully with me.<br>
<br>
Just as I was sitting down it started to hit me, not too strong but with increasing intensity, my vision was the first thing to be affected and everything started to break up into kaleidoscopic shapes, like an explosion never ending and continually morphing. Starting firstly only with what I focused on and then it started to affect all my vision until I was engulfed in this twirling visual, I could see outside this to some extent and was able to get up and walk around ok. But almost everything I focused on would engulf me in a twirling visual.<br>
<br>
It was about this time I started to feel uneasy about the thought of someone knocking on my door and coming in and finding me high as a kite with pornography. I live in an apartment building and our tap had been dripping hot water for several days, we had complained to the manager and were expecting the maintenance woman to come and fix it some time. My trip was becoming quite strong now and I felt I had to tidy up all the evidence, i.e. my bong the gear and all the other stuff not to mention the porn.<br>
<br>
This was kind of difficult as a kind of urgency and controlled panic was becoming imminent, not to mention that my motor skills were now somewhat impaired.<br>
I now felt that I was sending out a massive amount of telepathy to everyone near, That is into the whole building, upstairs, downstairs, to the sides and especially out of the back bedroom window, which was open and into the street.<br>
<br>
I felt as if everyone could quite clearly hear me moving around probably erratically, and also I felt absolutely certain that if they listened then they would have a clear and loud window into my mind, I felt both physically and psychologically naked, and all of my insecurities were coming to mind. I felt as if I was unable to hide my thoughts and everyone was now looking at me and seeing me laid bare, all my hopes fears and inadequacies, totally naked on a stage unable to keep my mind private.<br>
<br>
I knocked over an empty glass bottle and it smashed into pieces on the carpet, I picked up one piece followed by another and another and then I noticed that they were in a trail and I had a scenario visual I could hear everyone looking at me and discussing. I had a sense of urgency and fear that, one of these people, this crowd of people would knock on my door for fun. I felt like I would be caught like a rabbit in the headlights.<br>
<br>
I now had to pick every single little piece of glass up, they got smaller and smaller and disappeared into a trail. I felt that if I was caught then I would be a laughing stock and would certainly lose my girlfriend, I felt an enormous social pressure, and tried to pick up the pieces as fast as I could, only they were now getting so small that I could hardly see them, so I pretended to pick them up and the people listening to me didn’t seem to know that I was pretending, I tried to stay focused and didn’t let my thoughts wander to reveal that I was actually pretending. I felt that the big pieces were easy to pick and the smaller pieces represented social success and wealth, so I continued to pick them up until I felt that I had accomplished enough to fool my audience.<br>
<br>
Phew!! Now what should I do??<br>
<br>
I couldn’t sit still now I was quite disturbed, maybe I had better check round, Ok everything looks ok. Truth is I was so out of it now, the place was probably still in a mess. I was so damned hot too, I now looked down at my shorts and I had dribbled a little either during the trip or from the bathroom earlier, anyhow here was a wet patch. What if someone knocked now?  I felt like a rabbit in the headlights once more. I quickly decided to strip off and jumped into the shower, feeling intensely all the time that I was being watched.<br>
<br>
The droplets were like thousands of thoughts bombarding me, a toned down pscho-visual of earlier.  I felt reasonably safe in the shower but could still sense all the voices around me judging and commenting. I feel as if everyone knows of my vice, I feel as if I have to put on an act of normalcy so that my telepathy will be received as pure and clear.  I felt like a teenager again.<br>
<br>
After the shower, I saw that I had left the salvia on the kitchen worktop, oops! When I was hiding it and my porn under my bed a crow outside my window cawed a loud signal to everyone around, confirming some of the telepathy they had been listening to, this was quite real. Once more a little panic came over me, I went next door to change the music from some deep house which was chanting over and over “ I’m visible, I’m visible, I’m visible, that and a razor of love, well done you dumb as you feel like flying.”<br>
<br>
I was getting feelings of guilt now, I managed to change the music pretty smoothly, to Lou Reed “Perfect Day.”  Feelings of relief now at having made a smooth changeover, it was essential or all my guilt would have certainly been confirmed, and I would be noted by my peers, as a jerkoff!!<br>
<br>
All in all I managed to keep a grip on things and nothing went too wrong, although I feel as if I only just kept it together.<br>
<br>
So much for a sex buzz!!<br>
More like a try and hide everything from everybody, including the inner parts of my mind which were laid bare, except this tiny little part which was still private and I managed to use to manipulate my telepathic vibes, I was in disaster control and one mistake would have certainly sent the house of cards tumbling.<br>
It took a significant amount of effort and the fear of being caught was the overwhelming part of the experience.<br>
It wasn’t so strong as to render me Totally naked and helpless, although I do feel that it could have happened in this situation, with a stronger dose.<br>
<br>
Take note, you will not have any privacy doing this! You will share this experience intensely with your surroundings. Be that neighbours, people outside or the nature around you.<br>
Choose your time and place well, because you will be at the mercy of your surroundings and scenario. Ensure that you are in the right frame of mind and have a drink handy too because you’ll probably be quite thirsty afterwards.<br>
Just because this is a legal high don’t underestimate it.<br>
This is a full on trip and I guess it lasts about fifteen minutes with an afterglow for about an hour afterwards.<br>
Prepare to have yourself psychologically stripped and observed, if you set everything up with this in mind then you’ll be fine.<br>
Good music will probably be a must unless you’re out in the open surrounded by nature.<br>
Like all good trips, plan well, and the timing should ultimately depend on your final instinct of everything, to be unproblematic.<br>
<br>
Happy Tripping.<!--   End Body   -->

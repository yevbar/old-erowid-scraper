Okay, this experience happened roughly a week and a half ago, and my memory is a little shaky.  I have a good amount of experience with opiates, particularly oxycontin.  My tolerance, however, was at an all time low after a four-month abstinence.<BR>
<BR>
I obtained a bottle of Torbutrol from a veterinarian for administration to my cat.  The pills came in 1.25mg pieces (5mg whole). I browsed the web to see what I could dig up on these pills.  To my surprise, I found that they are an opiate synthesized from thebaine.  I further looked into it, and found that there was a form called 'Stadol' which was an aqueous solution designed for insufflation.  I immediately grew anxious to give it a try.<BR>
<BR>
I started by snorting 1/4 of a pill.  The burn was bearly noticable, but the drip tasted putrid- about two or three times worse than oxycontin. <BR>
<BR>
I waited a couple of minutes and felt nothing.  I then went ahead and bumped the other three quarters.  <BR>
<BR>
I proceeded into my room to play Amped, a snowboarding game, on my X-Box.  Within a couple of minutes I noticed a warm sensation beginning in my stomach and radiating out into my legs and arms.  Soon, I found myself somehow scoring higher than I ever had before, even though I was barely paying attention to what I was doing.<BR>
<BR>
After about ten minutes of X-box, I decided to lay down.  That's when it hit me like a ton of bricks.  The room was spinning, and I had an awesome warm, jello sensation througout my entire body.  It was pretty incredible, for a veterinary medicine.<BR>
<BR>
I was soon walking around socializing, growing a little antsy.  I could tell the effects were winding down.  <BR>
<BR>
I proceeded to my room and bumped another pill.  This time it hit me extremely hard.  I light up a bowl and laid on my bed.<BR>
<BR>
I was completely disoriented, and what started out nicely turned dreadful.  I had read of the dysphoria associated with high doses, and stupidly I ignored the advise.  <BR>
<BR>
I soon was feeling terrible feelings of panic and fear, potentiated by the pot.  I had the feeling that everything was out of control.  Within thirty minutes I passed out entirely.<BR>
<BR>
What was to follow was the most horrific, hellish, terrible nightmare I have ever experienced.  I will never forget it, either.  <BR>
<BR>
I was walking through all sorts of hallways and everywhere, there were mutilated corpses hanging from the cieling.  There's much more to it, but words fail me.<BR>
<BR>
The bottom line-  It was worth the experience.  The nightmare was horrible at the time, but bah, it was just a dream.  I now sit and try to analyze it and see what I can find.  For, in my mind, there is no such thing as a bad trip.<BR>
<BR>
I highly recommend keeping the dosage low, and resisting the temptation to redose.<!--   End Body   -->

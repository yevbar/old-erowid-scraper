A friend of mine was home from college for the weekend and told me how he had tripped on over-the-counter allergy pills. I didn't believe him, but I still agreed to try it. We went to the local 24-hour supermarket and picked up a box of 100 gelcaps, each of which contained 25 mg of diphenhydramine.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, we soon arrived back at my house, and I was very happy to find that my parents were asleep. With the coast clear, we each popped 24 pills and settled down to watch a movie.<BR>
<BR>
After about an hour, I began to feel somewhat stoned, sort of like I had just taken a hit or two from mid-grade marijuana. I grew bored with the movie and decided I'd get up and get something to drink. As I stood up, I felt as if my legs were being weighed down by a hundred pounds of cement. Walking was somewhat difficult, and more than once I nearly fell on my ass. I decided I'd rather sit down than get a drink, and so my friend and I plopped down on the couch.<BR>
<BR>
With the TV off, we sat in near silence. I tried to initiate a conversation, but kept forgetting what I was trying to say in mid-sentence. My friend simply stared into space and occasionally nodded.<BR>
<BR>
A few minutes after we had sat down on the couch, the good part began. I began to see a small number of rather mild open-eye hallucinations. When I looked at a particular houseplant in the corner of the room, I would see cone-shaped flashes of grayish light shooting out of it, which immediately disappeared. I saw what appeared to be flies buzzing around the room, but they too disappeared. As I looked at the ceiling, it began to flow towards me as if it were a liquid. Other objects in the room would seem to either twitch or jiggle.<BR>
<BR>
Eventually, we both went upstairs to my room. Soon enough my friend had fallen asleep. The odd part was that I would see him standing over by the door, fully awake, even as he was lying on the floor asleep. I tried to talk to him, but he too disappeared. I even saw my cat lying on the bed, and went over to pet him, only to see him disappear too.<BR>
<BR>
At some point in the night I fell asleep, and when I woke up around two in the afternoon, I found myself still feeling the physical effects (drowsiness, lethargy, weakness, etc.). It is now five o'clock and I still feel them.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, it was an interesting experiment, but the extended hangover is a serious drawback. Although the experience was somewhat enjoyable, the sluggish and half-dead feeling it causes the next day makes it more trouble than its worth.<!--   End Body   -->

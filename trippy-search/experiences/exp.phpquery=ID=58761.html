<!--   Start Body   -->


I ingested one half (4mg) of an 8mg sublingual Suboxone tablet about 20 minutes after waking up in the morning (8:30).  I allowed the tablet to dissolve beneath my tongue as directed and refrained from swallowing any of the saliva produced, keeping all of the drug/oral fluid inside my mouth for about 3 minutes before finally swallowing the solution.<br>
<br>
It has been two days since my last 'fix', as I have been addicted to a rather large array of opioids for about two years.  I am certain the entire 8mg tablet would not be a problem for me.<br>
<br>
T+1:00: <br>
I have some slight effects coming on.  No cravings for my Oxycontins, morphine, hydromorphone, hyrdrocodone. I feel nice and warm, no usual morning headache or extreme anxiety<br>
<br>
I take 2mg of Xanax 3x/day for anxiety.<br>
<br>
Today has been the first morning I have not needed to take my Xanax upon waking.  My stomach is starting to cramp ever so slightly, but nothing I would associate with the suboxone.<br>
<br>
A hit or two of some heady herb and things would be fine.<br>
<br>
T+1:30:   <br>
I feel very nice, eyelids are feeling a little heavy, ready to begin my day, going to drive(do not feel too intoxicated to drive) and pick up some odds and ends, get a prescription filled and come home and relax.  Without consuming the Suboxone I would most likely be in bed trying to sleep the day away while consuming xanax to ease my withdrawal symptoms   Will follow up in a few hrs.<br>
<br>
T+3:00:<br>
Very relaxed no dramatic increase in effects. Very Calm, unusual considering I have been taking 8-15mg of Xanax (in 2-5mg doses 3xdaily) and have not taken any today. Still do not feel like I am 'high', rather very level. I am a little hungry but am going to wait another hr or 2 before eating anything. I am pleased with the effects thus far, as I am seeking to discontinue my opiate use and currently have no cravings. Although, I suspect consuming 8-16mg would provide a noticeable rush/high, which may be desirable/addictive. More in a few hours.<br>
<br>
T+5:00:<br>
At 5hrs after sublingual consumption of 4mg suboxone, I feel I have achieved the peak effects of the drug.  I did not get high, nor sick (a valid concern for anyone who consumes suboxone with opiates already in their system).  However, I did not feel the urge to seek or consume the opiates which have been a part of my daily life for years.  <br>
<br>
I am ashamed to live in a country that would rather prescribe me oxycontin over a substance that could help break me from the bonds of the addiction controlling my life. Breaking this cycle is far beyond any one pill or counseling session, however I feel that with counseling, exercise, and professional medically administrated dosages of this drug I could break free from the choke hold of opiate addiction and return to the person I once was.<!--   End Body   -->

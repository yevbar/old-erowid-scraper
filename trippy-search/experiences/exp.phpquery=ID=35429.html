I recently purchased some Blue Lotus 15x extract from an online supplier  in search of a pain-therapy alternative to marijuana. <br>
<br>
My package arrived on time via USPS parcel, and I hurried home and into my room for a look. First off, this stuff looks better than any other 'legal' opiates I have bought online such as the Mexican Prickly Poppy which turned out to be bunk as hell. <br>
<br>
Secondly, just the smell and the green oil associated with this black hard gunk made me start to think, 'Hey, I might just have something here.' And lastly, the taste is something like a blast from the past like we have all smoked this stuff before (maybe it’s just my own reality created through the deja vu I get daily around my present group of friends). <br>
<br>
The smell and taste is sweet like a Blue flower would be expected to be. Very attractive. However, to achieve full potential of this flower (which I have only smoked it) is difficult because my pipe eventually gets to hot to smoke out of. And when it comes to me and entheogens I always prefer smoking them first instead of oral dosing because of the time duration being much shorter usually via smoking. <br>
<br>
So I have still not drank it, but I will eventually. I am out right now and waiting for the next order. <br>
<br>
However, smoking is very mild and pleasant. I cant say it would ever replace pot because of marijuanas psychological addictive qualities, but it makes me not miss real morphine as much. A lot funner than crushing pills and putting them up my nose anyways. <br>
<br>
I like to smoke about 1/4 of a gram at a sitting to myself. It is fun also sharing with friends, but again, my smoking utensil usually gets too hot to fast. After a while, it can get slightly difficult to even relight my lighter, or hold the pipe up.  <br>
<br>
The effects are quite subtle, mellow and numbing. And absolutely no side effects except sleep of course. I recently had found myself in a phase of insomnia in my life and this was truly a cure-all, or at least I would sleep four to six hours instead of not at all. <br>
So medicinally, on a scale of 1 to 10 for the price and ease of use via smoking, I would give it an 8. I am sure if I got the balls to finally drink some mixed with water or alcohol I would rate it a 10. <br>
<br>
Hell, I even mix it with pot to find a nice synergy there. Not bad, not bad.<!--   End Body   -->

Since there seems to be a lack of trip reports regarding oral DMT usage, I thought I'd write one (this is my first real trip report, go easy on me!<br>
<br>
I've been experimenting with oral DMT with mixed results. Since I don't really know how drug absorption works through the stomach, I have been slowly realizing that I've been doing it all wrong. Previously I had fasted for 8 hours prior to ingestion of an MAOI capsule, then 1/2 to 1 hour later a capsule of DMT freebase. It never worked that well. In another thread it was suggested to me to try to take the components dissolved in a liquid (skip the gelcap) and try to take a light carbohydrate snack with each. That was the first real successful trip. So next time (this time) I decided to not fast at all (but I still observed my dietary guidelines before taking an MAOI).<br>
<br>
It seems that it takes food 2-3 hours to completely leave the stomach (depending on how easily digested that particular food is), so I decided to eat like I normally would, and to prove a point have a large dinner (which I did, mmmmmmm). 2 hours after finishing dinner, I took 300mg of harmala alkaloids (gotten from the manske extraction of syrian rue) mixed in with a tablespoon or so of water. In the meantime, I prepared my psychedelic lemonade - 150mg DMT extracted from m.hostilis dissolved in a tablespoon of very warm lemon juice and a tablespoon of sugar and approximately 75-100ml of water added after all the oily freebase dissolved.<br>
<br>
Interestingly, this time I really felt the harmala alkaloids. About half an hour after taking the liquid I felt very relaxed and content. The Christmas lights around me had a very soft warm glow. I finally understand that these alkaloids are a drug on their own and can see that times I could use them all by themselves .....<br>
<br>
In all my previous experiments, it took pretty much 2 hours on the nose to start feeling the DMT, so I took the lemonade about 45 min before my oldest kids bedtime, about 1.25 hours after taking the harmala alkaloids.<br>
<br>
Well, my theory was correct in a large way. 25 minutes later I was tripping as hard as I would be.<br>
<br>
The room took on a sort of alien feel/vibe. Even though I knew everything around me, it seemed like it was the first time I was seeing any of it. Everything took on a sort of soft appearance (in contrast to LSD's sharp visions and edges). Things seemed to be made up of small pieces that were all buzzing and moving around.<br>
<br>
Exploring thoughts and deep thinking was very rewarding. Visions changed as I thought deeper about various things. I watched webs of light and electricity race across the ceiling. Walls were breathing - skin and body hair appeared very alien in appearance. Talking and getting ideas across to my SO was slightly difficult. I was a little confused at times as to what I was doing - Several times I had gone to get something, but forgotten what I was doing halfway through. Maybe I was just sidetracked by the visions.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the trip wasn't quite as therapeutic as I had hoped, due to the rapid onset and me not being ready for it. Good thing my SO was around to help take care of the things that I couldn't (like the kids). My pupils were huge and while the experience was not overly strong, it was strong enough that I wouldn't have had to want to deal with real life.<br>
<br>
After about 3 hours it was over.<br>
<br>
It was a very successful experiment and indicated to me that fasting is not only not necessary, but can be a detriment to the trip. There was no nausea whatsoever. It didn't last as long as I had hoped, but maybe it was because I was fully MAO inhibited for at least an hour before the DMT took effect, so that was an hour less of the trip.<br>
<br>
I am surprised that more people don't try DMT orally. Its completely different than smoking the freebase. I imagine that if you really like smoking freebase that the oral experience may be disappointing, but if you are looking for more of a traditional trip feel that you may really like it. I'm already looking forward to the next one.<!--   End Body   -->

<!--   Start Body   -->


Saturday, 5-13-06:<br>
<br>
12:45am (actually 5-14) - Ingest 21mg of 4-HO-DiPT freebase, dissolved in water with HCl to make the HCl salt, which is equivalent to approximately 24.2mg of 4-HO-DiPT HCl.  Is this chemical supposed to taste very strongly aversive?  It tastes really thick and strong, and repulses my body like it is a poison, much more so than with any of the other chemicals I've tasted.<br>
<br>
1:00 - A thunderstorm is approaching.  This should be interesting...<br>
<br>
1:23 - It's starting to come on strong, but smooth still.  Virtually no anxiety whatsoever.  Pupils have attained a moderate dilation, and blue and purple tones are mixing and becoming muddled.<br>
<br>
1:31 - I remain clearheaded.  My body feels almost completely free of any drug whatsoever, with no nausea or discomfort of any kind.  But there is something here, and it's upon me, but I can't quite put my finger on it.<br>
<br>
1:49 - I'm off to lay down and listen to music, to try to absorb into this experience.  At this point it feels very transient, almost illusory.<br>
<br>
3:30 - I've been up and reading online trip reports for about 15 minutes now.  What a weird drug!<br>
<br>
THE NEXT MORNING<br>
<br>
My notes from my experience end here, although I was up until about 5:20am before I tried sleeping.  This has been my second trial with 'iprocin' thus far, and I have to say, I really don't know what to think.  My first trial was at the equivalent freebase amount to 20mg of the HCl, and this trial was with the equivalent of a little over 24, and I was hard-pressed to find any difference whatsoever between the two doses.<br>
<br>
It came on quickly, but subtly.  At no point did I feel any anxiety whatsoever, which is very, very rare for me while coming up on anything psychedelic.  The body load was virtually nonexistant, with no nausea or malaise of any kind.  In fact, it is very hard for me to put my finger on what change had taken place from baseline.  I had a light electric energy running through me, but I remained 100% relaxed and calm.  My thought process and typing skills were not the least bit affected during the come-up.<br>
<br>
After about an hour, I felt that the drug had reached a peak.  Still, however, I felt mentally sober, with a slight amount of alteration that was very difficult to place.  It certainly wasn't euphoria, but I also felt quite nice.  At this point, the only visual effect I exprienced began, which was that everything attained a light blue hue, which bordered on purple.  Actual blues and purples were impossible to tell apart, as they kept shifting into one another.  There was no visual distortion, however, in terms of morphing and crawling.  My surroundings did appear more intense and perhaps were on the verge of movement, but that movement never arrived.  At this point my pupils were moderately dilated, but other than that, I looked normal in the mirror.<br>
<br>
Just after an hour had passed, I decided to lay down in my bed with a CD full of psychedelic tunes playing in my ear, to attempt to explore this substance.  At this point it felt transient, and almost illusory, like I was just imagining the effects.  However, there was a definite physical feeling I could not deny, running through me, feeling like I would imagine an extremely low-voltage electrical current would feel like.  I took two hits of vaporized cannabis, laid down, and began listening to the music.  It sounded very nice, better than usual for sure, but not really profound in any way, and some of that enhancement was certainly due to the cannabinoids in my receptors.  I was quite cognizant of the first few songs on the CD and was actively listening.  However, there was very little in the way of closed-eye visualization.  There was certainly some sort of process occurring within myself, and the body high increased substantially as tends to happen when closing my eyes for extended periods within any mental state.  I felt as if my body was rearranging itself and phasing out of existence, but this also happens to me when meditating or listening to music on cannabis alone.<br>
<br>
After the first few songs, I had slowly become much less aware of the passing music and time.  It wasn't like I had no memory of that period, but I cannot remember anything specific about it at all.  Perhaps I succeeded in phasing out?  If so, I cannot really see the value in it, because I have no memory of it.  This drug reminds me of DOC in that one small way, in that while under the peak effects, I tend to zone out and not really be able to remember much other than impressions the next day.  However, DOC remains much more engaging during this process, and feels much more profound, at least after my two trials with iprocin so far.  Also, like last time, I found myself startled to the point of involuntarily thrashing my body whenever the music made a sudden noise. <br>
<br>
I 'came to' as the CD was switching to the last song, feeling somewhat down, but also quite unable to place the difference.  Like the last trial, at this point I was beginning to feel an uncomfortable restlessness in my body, a definite discomfort with just being able to lay there unmoving that I didn't have at all during the peak and come-up.  I decided to get up before the last song was finished and go back to my computer to read some 2C-P experience reports, which is a chemical I'd like to try soon.  I switched the CD to some different music and began to do so.  Reading was very easy and rewarding, but not really significantly altered.  At this point, the physical effects were still going, but what little mental effects I had had were totally gone.  It was about 3:15, or T+2:30.  I began noticing a very faint tension headache centered around the base of my neck and back of the head, but it was very subtle and did not bother me at all, really.  My body remained restless, and it was rather uncomfortable sitting in my computer chair.  In general, I felt an annoying restless energy that completely banished any tiredness or sense of comfort with sitting still.  This restlessness continued until the morning, unfortunately.<br>
<br>
I didn't go to bed until about 5:30, at which point I laid around, basically comfortable but feeling the need to move continually.  My mind was active, though, so I enjoyed remaining partly conscious and experiencing vivid dream scenarios.  At about 6:45 I was awoken to loud thunder, as a storm had broken right above us, with minor color alteration in the blues and purples still present.  That kept me up for a while, and I fell into restless half-sleep again until about 8:00, at which point I woke up, feeling completely rested.  As I'm finishing up this report, it's 12:28am on Monday, shortly before I try to go to sleep, and I'm still not tired, although the restless energy has been gone since I woke up this morning.<br>
<br>
I wasn't going to write a report, because the experience was rather uneventful.  However, I wanted to solidify my opinions on this drug, as well as just get my experience out there to contribute to the data.  As it stands, after completing two trials with this compound, at 20 and 24mg, I'm hard-pressed to find anything that made it worth repeating, although it certainly wasn't unpleasant.  In fact, it was exceedingly comfortable in the body and mind.  Perhaps it would be a good choice for an introductory tryptamine experience for a newcomer to the psychedelic world.  Perhaps I will still be able to get more from this, at a higher dose.  Although I tend to be sensitive to psychedelics in general, perhaps I'm naturally tolerant to this one.  I'll try it again at a larger dose, perhaps even 30mg, but I'm not in a hurry to do so. <br>
<br>
Overall, I liked a few things about iprocin, namely its extreme ease on the body and mind, and overall friendly nature.  It also had a few downsides, the restless energy that was present both times after the peak got quite annoying when I was trying to sleep even though I was nearly baseline, and the slight tension headache that developed was similarly annoying.  Its short duration is nice, but at least at the doses I've tried, it's just not strong enough for my tastes.  There was a head change, but implacable... it certainly wasn't a headfuck of any sort.<br>
<br>
So with that, I'll leave this one alone for a while and pursue some of my favorite phenethylamines.  At this point, I am able to get a lot more out of them, for the most part.<!--   End Body   -->

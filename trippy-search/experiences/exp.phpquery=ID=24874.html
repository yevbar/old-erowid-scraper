Me and some friends were home at my place and we had decided to try HBW. I am 18 years old and this was the first time I've done any psychadelic drug. Me and another guy took the seeds and put in our mouth raw, started chewing. The taste wasn't so bad that I had been told. It kinda reminded of nuts. I ate 9 seeds and the other guy 5. Then we sat and waited for the effects to start.<br>
<br>
The other guy started to feel sickness and when we went outside he started to puke. I didn't feel any sickness at all just feeling kinda weird in a way that I can't really explain. We want back to my place again and started to watch a movie. I then began to feel very sleepy so I sat in the bed and almost fell asleep. This was about 2 and a half hour after I had eaten the seeds.<br>
<br>
Suddenly I woke up at once with a rush trough my whole body and mind. The world had suddenly changed and I remember touching every surface including my friends shirt cause I felt everything was so beautiful and so very different to touch. I felt I just had to go outside to explore it further. The other guy that were feeling sick before now went home so it was just me and 2 other friends and we went to the store in a nearby gas station.<br>
<br>
When I went inside the lights and different smells gave me a complete rush of happiness and everything just seemed beautiful. We then went home to one of my friends and I remember lying in his bed and feeling so extremely happy. I tried to tell them how wonderful it felt but I couldn't make out any words.<br>
<br>
After around 40-50 mins we decided to go back to my place. This is where I began to trip real intense. In the elevator my friend's bodys seemed warped and their faces were all messed up. I didn't feel good so I laid down in the bed. Then I began hallucinate real hard. My body felt like liquid and I had very unpleasant hallucinations of my eyes feeling wet all the time and when I tried to dry them with my fingers it just dissapeared and then came back. I told the other friends to leave me and only one of them who had tried HBW before should stay and try to calm me down cause now I was tripping so hard I could barely tell what was real.<br>
<br>
I was really loosing it. At this stage I was yelling 'Help! I don't know what's real anymore!' At this point my mom who had been home the whole time heard me and come in and wondered what was going on. She realised I had taken some kind of drugs and was yelling at me. I finally made her leave the room and my friend tried again to calm me down, which surely wasn't easy.<br>
<br>
I wasn't sure of where I was and who I was and I couldn't keep my eyes open. My friend told me this was only temporarily and would wear off in a couple of hours. But I could not focus on the aspect of time anymore. How long was a minute or a hour? I couldn't tell. I wasn't sure if I was talking or only thinking. It seemed like I had been there in the bed for days. Bad waves of fear and paranoia was filling my poor mind. What I experienced felt like it would go on forever and I could not take it anymore, I just wanted to be normal again.<br>
<br>
After what seemed endless I was finally beginning to come down. I was back in reality more or less. Later on I could feel it wearing off and just layed in the bed talking to my friend. Eventually I felt like I was going to sleep but I was still hallucinating some. After maybe 10-20 min I felt sick and went to the bathroom to puke. After that I felt much better and could finally go to sleep.<br>
<br>
I would not try these seeds again, they were too much for me. Next time I will just eat a small dose mushrooms for a milder trip. I didn't want anything so intense. The worst part was that I felt extreme horror and panic which seemed endless.<!--   End Body   -->

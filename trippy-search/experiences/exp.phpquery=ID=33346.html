Three days ago I decided to mix three of my favorite psychedelic drugs together. I had no idea what to expect, each of the substances and had given me such a different trip individually. Mushrooms always give me a happy trip, and to me they are a very fun trip. So i started by eating 3.5 grams of mushrooms at 9:00 p.m. and then headed down to my friends room, she lives three floors down, she was already tripping(3.5 grams of mushrooms), as was her boyfriend(2 hits of acid). <br>
<br>
I waited for the mushrooms to hit me, and they did rather quickly. It was 9:25 and i already was feeling the effects. I felt sick, as mushrooms always make me feel, but i knew i wouldn't puke because i never have off of mushrooms. So at 9:40 we smoked a mixed bowl of saliva and cannabis. I got four hits off the bowl(i held each hit in for 30 secs and then exhaled), and i was instantly set off. I could feel the saliva working, my mind began to wonder about life, and it was overwhelming at first. I began to look around the room, the lights were off, but she had little lights that were in the shape of butterflys all over the room, they were glowiing to me, and the room was breathing. I began to see visuals, the butterflys were moving, and it caught me off guard, so i quickly closed my eyes. <br>
<br>
The most amazing CEV appeared and i just kept my eyes closed. I did this for a while, i looked at the clock and saw that it was only 10:20, so i decided it was time for my DXM dosage. I slowly ate 8 triple c pills(i got the ones that had only DXM in them, they contain 30 mg/ pill) So ingested 240 mg of DXM, and then smoked a bowl of saliva by myself. The trip was getting more intense now, i was hearing auditory sounds that werent there. My friends were both echoing very badly. I gave up on communicating with them and turned the music up. We were listening to morning view(whole album) by Incubus. <br>
<br>
I could slowly feel the DXM being digested, it always upsets my stomach and gives me cramps. I felt like i wanted to puke, but i didnt. i held it in. It was 10:50 now and the mushrooms were in full effect. I smoked another bowl of saliva and when i finished i couldnt see straight, visuals were flying at me everywhere. Her room was alive, and i was thinking about how tripping always brings out the craziest thoughts in my head, I began to remember previous trips and reflect on them. Suddenly i felt the DXM creep up. I was still laying on the bed, and i could feel the dopamine dripping down my spine, i always feel it when i take DXM. The texture of the bed felt so good, and i was so excited, I could feel the uplifting effect of the DXM. Mushrooms always make me mellow, as does Saliva too. But now i really felt alive. <br>
<br>
I wanted to go out and do something. So i got up from laying down, and instantly was hit with a head rush, i sat back down quickly, and started looking around, everything was spinning, visuals were everywhere. I looked in the mirror and my pupils were very dilated. I began to worry that i might start to trip too hard. Suddenly i realized that i had to go to the bathroom, but didnt wannt to leave the room. I didnt want anyone to know that I was tripping. So I just sat there in confusion, debating the pros and cons of not going to the bathroom. Finally I decided to make a quick run to the restroom, and took care of buisness.  When I got back to the room, my friends were just looking at me and laughing. I decided it was time for more saliva, so i packed another bowl, and we smoked it. <br>
<br>
It was around 11:30 now, and i could feel the peak of mushrooms taking effect, the DXM was getting stronger too, the visuals were more intense, both with my eyes open and closed. I felt so alive. We put on a new cd, I picked out a old phish show, and we chilled to that. Incubus had me feel discontent with my life. i felt sad, after listening to it. I was having fun on my tip, but it was a sad trip. I knew phish would set me off and out me in a great mood. So listened to it, nothing spectacular happened for a while. we all just laid around and listened to music, We packed another saliva bowl, and as we began to smoke, 'Harry Hood' started playing. Once we finished the bowl, i laid down and looked at the ceiling. Visuals covered the ceiling, the butterflys were flying everywhere. It was getting more intense and i was enjoying. <br>
<br>
Suddenly i was tapped and it scared me. I looked over and my friend said she had said my name three times. I was in my own world. They said they were hungry and were going to walk up to the cafeteria, I said i would stay in the room. So they left and i was alone in the room. The visuals kept getting more intense, they were makling me feel sick, the music didnt sound right, i was hearing distortions and echos that I knew shouldnt be there, i was getting scared. I had never had a bad trip, and this one was starting to go to shit. I began to feel really sick, my stomach was churning horribly. I couldnt stand up, i tried several times but couldn't. I simply didnt have the ability to stand. <br>
<br>
Around 1:15 a.m. they got back and found me laying on the bed, totally out of it, i said was going to my room, they both said they would drop by in a little while, i went straight to bed, as i was laying there with my eyes closed, the room felt like it was spinning, i could hear voices outside echoing, and i was seeing the people who were talking, it was other friends who live on my hall. I felt like shit, somehow i passed out, i awoke around 7 a.m. I was still tripping, immeditely i saw visuals on the ground and on the ceiling. I got up and looked in the mirror, my eyes were still very dilated. I went back to sleep, i was still feeling like shit. <br>
<br>
I awoke again around 11:00 a.m. the visuals were gone but i still felt the mental effects of the DXM. I just sat around waiting for the effects to die down. It ended up taking the whole day for them to leave. Overall I enjoyed the first part of the trip, but i think DXM and mushrooms are not meant to ingested together, it was too much for my stomach. That ruined my trip at the end.<!--   End Body   -->

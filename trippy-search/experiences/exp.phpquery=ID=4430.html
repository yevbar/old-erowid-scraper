One of my best friends had a hard time a couple of years ago.  Because of it, she was introduced to a lot of different drugs. Later, she stopped doing most of them, but kept up with the ectasy and speed (and pot in the summer).  <br>
<br>
One day while she was doing some speed I asked if I could try it.  I was the good girl, smoked pot maybe a dozen times in my life.  We did a line and it was great.  I've read about some people who get addicted, and even my friend says that after her first time she couldn't get enough.  I really enjoyed that immediate high (but not the pain or the post-nasal drip, yuck!) and we connected in a way that we never have before.  I'm quite the shy type and never really talk about my feelings, but I really opened up.  I told her things that I barely let myself think about usually.  We are now closer than ever.  I remember the feeling of absolute trust.  We discussed everything from world politics movies and music.  Nothing was wrong.  Life was perfect even as we discussed our problems.  The comedown was gradual and just left me feeling tired.  Since that first time, we've done it a couple of times a month, usually on weekends.  Sometimes a month or two will go by before we do it again.  I really enjoy it, do a line or two at about 9 or 10 and then head out to a club and dance the night away.  Do another one at about 1 and go back to a friends place and talk all night.  I'm usually really tired the next day, but I avoid taking more because I don't want to depend on it to go through the day.  <br>
<br>
The only bad time I had was about 5 or 6 months ago.  We stayed at a friend's place the whole evening and all of us were on speed so it was a very entertaining evening.  At about 6 in the morning they went to bed so my friend and I headed over to another friend's place where we could crash.  We didn't.  We did a couple of more lines and bonded.  I had to be home at 10 to clean the house with my mother, so the two of us headed back.  We were so wired!  It was extremely difficult to talk to my mother without her seeing my eyes.  We looked like shit so I told her we had spent the night drinking and crashed at a friend's house and were a little hung over and wanted to go back there after the house was cleaned because he had a waterbed that was so comfortable.  Total bullshit.  It took the two of us 45 minutes to vacuum, dust, wash dishes, move furniture, and make all the beds.  Usually it takes me pretty much all day.  My mother was shocked and a little suspicious but I said we just really wanted to get back.  We went to her place and did more.  Later that night we went to another friend's place and did more.  Stayed up all night again and did more in the morning.  <br>
<br>
By the time I got back home that evening, I was dead on my feet.  I went to bed at 7 and was still awake at 12.  I had done my last line at 1 in the afternoon.  My heart was racing so bad I thought it was going to explode.  My body shook from chills even though I had an electric blanket turned way up.  My eyes actually vibrated.  I kept hearing things and seeing things out of the corner of my eyes.  I finally took 5 herbal Calms to help my calm down and sleep.  An hour later I took 3 more and was asleep in 20 minutes.  I did a tiny line the next day to get my sorry ass out of bed.  It was a horrible feeling.  Like the earth had ended while I wasn't looking.  My mother was still suspicious and checked my eyes.  They weren't too dilated so I was fine.  She told me never to smoke pot again.  I couldn't believe it.  She has smoked pot, so she knows what happens.  I think maybe she didn't want to know what I was really doing.  <br>
<br>
Since then I keep it to a one nighter only.  I still do it occasionally, when I go to a club and don't want to drink.  Too many cops on the road and I make sure I'm not very high when we leave, just in case.  I enjoy crystal because it's cheap, easy to get, and a fun high.  Just have to be careful about the when and where.  Home, during the day, BAD!  Club, at night, GOOD!  I'm just lucky I'm not an addictive personality.  I never crave it. I never do it alone, and never more than 2-3 times a week, and that's a binge.  Weeks, even months will pass by before I think of it again.  I have friends who can't live without it and that's not a life.<!--   End Body   -->

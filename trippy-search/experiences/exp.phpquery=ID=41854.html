We've all heard stories of people having panic attacks after smoking pot, who have claimed that their bud was laced with meth. It's usually just an adverse reaction to the ganja, but in this case it actually *was* laced. I thought I would post this so people could gauge the difference. <br>
<br>
A brief background, I'm an 18 year old male, I've been smoking marijuana for 4 years, on and off. I smoke 3-4 times a week. It typically just makes me more sociable, thoughtful, and friendly. I don't get really 'messed up,' off of it, and people typically don't realize that I'm stoned. Sorry for digressing, but I was trying to give an idea of how marijuana usually affects me.<br>
<br>
My friend B had invited my friend M and I over for some pot-smoking and conversation. I had been over to B's place a couple times when he had been snorting meth, it's not a drug I think very highly of, but he acted normal under the influence of it, assured me he had it under control, so it didn't bother me much. When we arrived, his girlfriend (a pretty big cokehead/tweaker, with psychological problems) was sitting on a chair, drinking some vodka. The mindset: casual, happy-to-be-hanging-with-friends.<br>
<br>
B had a good 1/4 oz of pot broken up in a tray, which looked like mediocre schwag. <br>
<br>
He rolled a rather large joint for us, which we smoked while catching up on each other's lives. Within the next 20 minutes, we smoked 3 bowls of this same pot. At this point, E was writhing around, twitching compulsively, and screaming in a British accent, talking about how she missed Europe (she's never left the US). <br>
<br>
I was rather freaked out at this time. I felt the usual perceptual differences of marijuana, but that stoned feeling wasn't really there. I felt more stimulated. It reminded me of a time when I had combined a lot of methylphenidate (Ritalin) with pot. I felt like I had to be talking, but I could not formulate words. I wanted to get out of B's place, and just walk around. My friend M, who takes Concerta legitimately, was remarking on how stoned he was, and how great the pot was, rather unusual for him. <br>
<br>
Things began to get worse. E was escaping into the bathroom periodically, bringing the tray of pot with her, to do lines of what I assumed to be meth or coke, bringing B with her a lot of the time. About twenty minutes later, My friend L comes over, doesn't smoke any of the pot, and talks to E a lot. E is really upset, talking a lot about nothing, and won't stop moving. She seems glad to have someone to talk to. 5 minutes after this, my friends C and J come over, and smoke 3 bong bowls with me. This was pot they had brought, they did not smoke anything out of the tray. <br>
<br>
E started freaking out over the presence of J, apparently they don't get a long very well. So we decide to leave. I'm not feeling anxious about the situation at the time, I'm actually relieved to be outside and in the company of my non-tweaking friends. Then, something hit me. It felt like cocaine, but much cruder and less euphoric. I couldn't stop moving for the life of me. That was when L told me that E said she 'laced the weed with tweak.' <br>
<br>
I was to ride in L's car, while everyone else rode with M, to J's house. I rode with L to give her directions and because she was prescribed Xanax (alprazolam) for anxiety, I thought we could drive to her house and get it, because my muscles were clenching and I felt really bad. Not to say there wasn't a euphoria, I just had no idea how much meth I had ingested and was extremely worried. All during the car ride, I was talking and stroking L's hair and face. My hands were sweating a lot. <br>
<br>
Finally she gets it, I chew up (very hard, my mouth was extremely dry) 2 1mg tablets and drive half an hour to J's house. By the time we got there, I felt perfectly normal, just a bit out of it. Xanax taints my memory, so I don't remember many details after that. We just talked for 3 hours in J's house, smoking cigarettes. <br>
<br>
M was not as affected as I, but he did not smoke as much. However, he told me he stayed up until 3, completely wired. We both remarked on how we wanted to go jogging. I'm pretty grateful I was with such good friends (meth heads excluded), they saved me from having a horrible experience.<!--   End Body   -->

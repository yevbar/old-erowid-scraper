Usually when I'm high I come online and read through some of the experience reports.  I always think to myself that I should write one except for the fact I have never really had a truly exceptional high, until now.  Don't get me wrong, I have been stoned off my ass and full of unending energy for hours on meth but my most recent experience with meth was almost undescribable.  I am writing this report about 45 minutes after I finished smoking it, and still on a good high :)  I have been using crystal for about the past 10 months, on and off, sometimes I will use it 3 or 4 times in a week, sometimes I will go for a month without even touching it.  I have of course been using weed since high school (haven't we all  lol), and have use extacy and ghb on occasion.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I hadn't used meth for about a week prior to this experience and I was kind of looking forward to getting high, as I had just bought a glass bulb pipe the day before.  This was my first real time smoking meth, a while back I had taken a few hits from a pipe after I was already high from snorting, but didn't really feel anything, ever since I have always snorted it.  Usually to get a good high going when I snort I use about 2 or 3 fat lines.<br>
<br>
I got home around 1:20p.m. and got out my stash of crystal, my lighter, and my new pipe and sat down at my dining table.  I usually get high with friends before going to a party or sometimes I snort a line or two before heading out to the gym.  Today I had no plans and my mom wasn't coming home from work for a few hours so I thought I'd try and see just how high I could actually get from it.  I took out a medium sized crystal, what I guessed would have been about 3 medium-large lines if I had snorted it and put it through the hole in the top of the pipe.  I lit up and took a big hit, which I held in my lungs for about 30 seconds or so.<br>
<br>
I repeated this maybe half a dozen times and perhaps I wasn't getting enough smoke, because I went through the first crystal and smoked up its residue as well, and had a nice high going but wasn't really getting the 'rush' everyone talks about. A slight tingly feeling had started to occur but nothing unlike what I've felt from snorting the same amount.  I already had it in my head that I wanted to get really high and of course once I reach that point there's no stopping me :)  I took out another crystal, this one almost twice the size of the first one and put it in the pipe.  After a few big hits, most of it had liquified.<br>
<br>
At this point I took out another crystal and crushed it up to make two medium sized lines, which I snorted.  The next hit I took from the pipe I held in about 30 or 40 seconds and when I slowly blew it out, this intense warm rush of euphoria washed over my whole body.  I have never felt anything like it and with each breath I took in and out another wave enveloped me.  This continued through the end of the second crystal that I was smoking.  Now usually to get a feeling like I had right then would have been more than enough, but I took out another crystal, this one so large I had to break it up in 3 pieces to get it through the hole in the top of the pipe.  I glanced over at the clock for a second and was shocked.  I had already been smoking for 50 minutes!<br>
<br>
It felt for a second like I lost track of time, and each breath I took this rush of pleasure kept coming over me. I was starting not to care about anything except the rush.  I started smoking the third crystal and each time I took a hit the feeling became more and more intense.  Each time I held in the smoke and then blew it out, it became more and more intense. I thought I should write this report while I'm still high from it :) so that I could better describe what the feeling was like, but to put it into words is still hard.  I was savoring each hit and between hits my body would start to sway and the warm rushes I felt were incredible, it was the best feeling I have ever had from anything, any drug, sex, anything.  I am a very strong willed person who always looked down upon addicts, but at this moment I realized why a person would become addicted.<br>
<br>
I don't know why but I felt the need to start softly talking out loud as I was swaying back and forth.  I kept saying in this really slow, faded sounding voice 'This feels so good oh my god.' and each time after I said it I would take a breath and exhale and the waves would become even more intense. I have had some really good highs before on weed, exstacy, ghb, and of course crystal, but none that even came close to what I was feeling. My 'good' highs before on meth had come after snorting maybe 5 lines instead of the usual 3, but this high was completely different.  Usually I become full of energy and feel like I can do anything when I snort a few lines of meth, but I have never felt a euphoria like this one.<br>
<br>
Another point I think I should mention is that when I get high on anything, I usually stay fairly grounded in reality, while at the same time enjoying the high.  I think the reason for this is that I'm very self aware, but this high was different.  For a few minutes I completely lost myself in its warmth, feeling completely happy, very aware of things but at the same time very chilled out, almost like a perfect high on some really good herb combined with a perfect high from snorting, magnified 10 times over, but with the warm rushes and incredible intense feeling of pleasure, to compare it to any previous high I've had from snorting or smoking weed would not even begin to come close.  I wasn't extremely energized like I usually am, all I wanted to do was just sit back and lose myself in this high's exquisite pleasure.<br>
<br>
As I finished off the last of the third crystal, I realized there was a large amount of residue still in the pipe.  At this point, although I was still very high, it crossed my mind to look at the clock, for I had started at 1:30 and my mom gets home at 4, so I wanted to make sure I'd have time to clean up and spray some air freshener before she got back.  When I looked at the clock it was 2:45.  I had been smoking for an hour and 15 minutes!  It felt like only seconds since I started, I started to think that maybe I should start cleaning up because it might take me a while in the state I was in, but all I wanted to do was bring my high further along.<br>
<br>
I started lighting up the residue in the pipe and took a hit.  As I breathed out, I felt the most incredible rush yet of the session, my whole body and face started to sway back and forth as I whispered out loud how much pleasure I was in.  At this point I started to have trouble controlling my movements and I dropped the pipe on the table where the bulb part of it shattered, making a mess all over the table.  I thought for a second that this would end my experience, but then I looked at the stem of the pipe, still intact, and still filled with residue.  After about 3 more large hits, my lighter completely ran out of fluid!  Even with some of my marathon weed sessions with a friend, that has never happened.<br>
<br>
I drifted out of consciousness again for a few seconds, as with each breath the warm rush of euphoria continued to course through my body.  I wish I could explain this better, but the pleasure I felt is indescribable, no matter what words I use, as I read back through it, they don't fully capture the intensity of the experience.  It felt like I was in heaven and experiencing a world of warmth and pleasure that I never imagined existed. It continues to amaze me how different this high was from snorting.  If I had snorted the amount that I just smoked, I would have had the energy to run a marathon for days, lol. This high was unlike any high I've had from meth, or anything else, ever.  Although when I snort it, I do get a bit of a rush it was nothing even close to what I felt this time.<br>
<br>
After sitting at my table for a few minutes after the lighter ran dry, pondering what had just happened to me, and if I had learned anything about myself from it, as I always do during and after a high on anything, I came to the conclusion that I hadn't really discovered anything, all my energy was concentrated on feeling the magnitude of this incredible high, I hadn't even a chance to introspectively look at myself.  I chuckled at this thought, thinking for a minute that this is what an addict must feel like.  I am disciplined enough not to allow myself to become addicted to a drug, whenever I begin to think I am using too much, I take a few days off to let my body recover, but this high did show me the power that a drug like meth can have over someone.<br>
<br>
I am not planning on smoking that much again for a long ass time because I don't want to build a tolerance to it, but for a few seconds at the end of my session when I was thinking about it and still enjoying the feeling, I felt like I would do anything to stay in a state of such bliss.  A last thing about this high that was different from my previous highs, is that about 15 minutes after I finished smoking, the warm rushes were almost gone, and I was actually not nearly as energetic as I would have been if I had snorted say 3 or 4 lines.  And I went through nearly 1/2 a gram.<br>
<br>
From my experience it seems that smoking produces an incredible rush, although the high after the rush is not as fun as it is with snorting.  Snorting, however doesn't really produce that much of a completely euphoric effect, more of an all around sense of well being.  Anyways, having thought about all this for a while, I finally got up from the table and went about cleaning up the mess I had made.  I washed my hands when I was done and I looked at my right thumb, which was almost rubbed raw from flicking the lighter so much.  While I was high, I didn't even feel it.<br>
<br>
All in all I'm very glad I had this experience, as I would go as far to say that it was really the best feeling of my life.  It seems to me that is a bit pathetic to make a statement like that, but I am simply giving as honest a description as I can.  As I'm writing this, I am thinking of how I will describe it to my best friend, whom I have shared some insane highs with, or if I will forgoe the description and tell him to just try it himself :)   It was definitely a great experience, although not an overly productive one, and while it was fun, I do not plan on smoking that much meth again for a long time.<!--   End Body   -->

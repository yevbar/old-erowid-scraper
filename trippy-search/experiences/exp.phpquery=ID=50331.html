I have taken 1000mg of rose root several times before, and it's great, so figured I'd take 2000mg. I got the typical safety-feeling and the coffee-like stimuli. It's a little different though. It doesn't tense you up like coffee may do. It makes you feel safe, totally comfortable, with great mood-lift and with an urge to have fun and just do something!<br>
<br>
(5feb. 2006)Day 1:<br>
<br>
20:00 PM: Had just popped 1000mg. Started to feel it in 15 minutes. I went down to my room and finally realized how messy it was, typical teen-ager room, so I cleaned it all up AND took out all my sweaters and tee's and put them back in perfect order. All the while I watched the movie 8Mile. After that(21:30) I wrote a song, which was really cool. I was finished by 2AM. Even though, I had difficulty sleeping.<br>
<br>
(6feb. 2006)Day 2:<br>
<br>
Took 2000mg at school. I managed to focuse much better, without feeling as tense as I sometimes do with coffee. School finished at 11:30 today. I went home and cleaned the kitchen! Not typical for me, but it's all good I guess. :P<br>
<br>
19:30 I dropped 2000mg more to have some extra energy during my soccer exercise. This worked very well! I manage to push myself further and FOR THE FIRST TIME I have managed to understand almost everything our irish coach who doesn't speak Norwegian very well, said. If I could be this focused every day I might get better grades, more chicks and stuff too!<br>
<br>
20:00 Feel a little tense, but nothing big. Disappairs after some running.<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
This herb is great for energy, libido-increase* use as an anti-depressant and just plain confidence-, health- and mood-enchancer.<br>
*(I didn't mention that I masturbated 3times both days!)<!--   End Body   -->

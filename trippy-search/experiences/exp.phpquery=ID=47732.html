<!--   Start Body   -->


Substances:	T +0:00	16mgs 2C-B-Fly (orally)<BR>
		T +3:25	0.3g weed (smoked)<BR>
		T +5:10	20mgs Methylone (orally)<BR>
<BR>
Subject is a healthy male, 102kgs, no meds taken during the last 10 days.<BR>
<BR>
T +0:00 Ingestion of 16mgs of 2C-B-Fly solved in water with some apple juice on an empty stomach (last food ingestion was approx. 8 hours before). BP 141/79 mmHg, HF 68 bpm.<BR>
T +0:17 Definitely onset. Some body sensations and I feel a little cold. A little stomach discomfort.<BR>
T +0:23 A good +. Colours are much enhanced, they seem brighter. Some slight morphing effects. Stomach discomfort has gone. BP 144/78 mmHg, HF 80 bpm.<BR>
T +0:29 ++ now. I have to dim the lights a little. Body feeling is very much enhanced, touching is very intense. Minor auditory distortions.<BR>
T +0:34 A very strong ++ (and still rising!). During the last 10 mins. I tried to watch TV but this is definitely too much. My sitter lights some candles, all other lights are switched off. This is much better. I put on “Ommadawn” by Mike Oldfield, this music feels very good. Very vivid closed eye visuals.<BR>
<BR>
T +0:51 Reached +++ during the last minutes, but it seems that I´ve plateaued right now. This is strong, really strong! Got some muscle cramps in my legs, my mouth is very dry. Drinking some water helps a little but not for long. BP 153/88 mmHg, HF 96 bpm.<BR>
T +1:04 Some very unpleasant jaw clenches, also some stomach discomfort again. I go to the balcony to smoke a cig. Looking into the darkness of the park behind our house is very interesting – lots of morphing effects. I run up and down the balcony because I feel that I need to move a little. After I returned to the living room I find it hard to sit down again. Lots of energy and I don´t know what to do with it.<BR>
T +1:12 I turn on the Nintendo, maybe doing a game will canalize the energy. I give up after approx 5 mins., because I can´t concentrate on it. Still +++. BP 146/77 mmHg, HF 80 bpm.<BR>
<BR>
T +1:26 Clenches have gone. My sitter and I decide to do a little walk into the park. Aah, that´s good! The cold air feels very refreshing. Fortunately, there´s nobody around at this time (approx. 10:50 pm). I feel that I could get quite paranoid if I met someone. Dwarfs and goblins seem to hide behind the bushes. The stars seem brighter than ever before. The darkness around me seems to have its own colour: it´s not black, but it´s a very dark green. We pass an old maple tree: it´s morphing all the time and everywhere in the tree, I can see faces of spirits. I hug the tree, because I want to become one with it and its spirits. It seems to pulsate. Quite a spiritual experience.<BR>
T +2:02 Back to our apartment. During the last 10 mins. I had a little of a feeling, that I´m coming down. BP 142/80 mmHg, HF 92 bpm (arrhythmic!).<BR>
T +2:08 Down to ++. I´m a little disappointed, because I hoped, this material would last longer. I turn on the TV and find “Dude, where´s my car”. I love this movie under weed, so let´s see how it is under the Fly.<BR>
<BR>
T +2:25 Now this is irritating: I´m back to +++. What´s happening here? And the clenches are back.<BR>
T +2:31 I´m back at ++ again. This is really strange. During the next 40 mins. I´m riding a wave between ++ and +++ for 3 times again. BP 154/97 mmHg, HF 84 bpm.<BR>
T +3:16 Back to a stabile ++. I discuss with my sitter how to go own with the trip.<BR>
T +3:25 I smoke 1/3 gram of weed. Instantly I shoot back to +++. Still very much energy, but a the same time I feel very tired. I can´t describe this, it´s somehow like trying to sleep while riding a rollercoaster. “Saturday night live” has just started, but once again I can´t concentrate on the TV, so I ask my sitter to put on a CD again. She chooses Bo Hansson´s “Lord of the Rings”, one of my favourite trip CDs. I can really feel the music, but some parts are just too fast for me. Once again I go to the balcony to smoke a cig. Very intense visuals as I look out into the darkness. The trees move in a gentle fall wind and morph all the time. Some kind of weird manga is running before my eyes. It´s quite cold out there but I don´t feel it. BP 138/86 mmHg, HF 104 bpm.<BR>
<BR>
T +3:47 Trip is still very fast and slow at the same time. I still can´t describe this state. My thoughts are running at high speed but most of it doesn´t make any sense. I feel that I have lots of ideas, but I fail to put them down. My sitter offers to assist me, but I find out, that there are no words to describe my ideas. They have a lot to do with physics and chemistry, but nothing really makes sense.<BR>
T +3:58 As always, when a trip is very fast, my smoking frequency rises. I´m back to the balcony when it comes to me, what I tried to describe during the last 30 mins: this trip´s is like a rocket flying into a huge pile of pillows again and again. Yes, that´s it! At one moment I´m the rocket, at the next moment I´m the pillows, and one moment later I´m neither the rocket nor the pillows, but the pure speed energy! Visuals are still wild. BP 135/87 mmHg, HF 108 bpm.<BR>
<BR>
T +4:23 Fortunately, the trip has become a little slower during the last 5 mins, a strong ++ now. Now I´m really enjoying this (not that it was too unpleasant before, but at some times, the energy was simply too much). Back to the TV, “South Park” is on. I have lots of fun during the next 30 mins. After that I try a little gaming on the PC, which goes surprisingly well, but becomes boring after approx. 15 mins. BP 142/77 mmHg, HF 84 bpm.<BR>
T +5:05 I´m getting tired. It´s already 2:25 am, but my sitter has had so much coffee during the evening, that she don´t want to go to bed – neither do I. I bring on the idea from my first 2C-B-Fly experience, that some Methylone could be quite interesting. Unfortunately, I only have 20mgs left. We decide that I should try it.<BR>
T +5:10 20mgs of Methylone solved in apple juice are ingested.<BR>
T +5:16 Wow, here comes the rocket again! I´ve never had such a fast response to Methylone before, and the 20mgs feel just like normally 150mgs do. Talking is easy. Writing is easy. Everything is just easy! BP 162/101 mmHg, HF 112 bpm.<BR>
<BR>
T +5:28 The waves are back, but this time with a much higher amplitude. Try to imagine this: Changing from +++ to threshold and back to +++ within minutes. Now this is what I call a psychedelic rollercoaster! (I wonder what might had happened, if I had had more Methylone available…) At one moment I feel like up in space and the next moment I think I could perfectly run machines or drive a car – which I´d never do under RCs, but it brings my sitter to an idea: Some months ago, we luckily got a copy of an original training program used in some driving schools. I start it on my PC and off I go… well, not too good… After causing 2 major and 9 minor accidents and killing 8 innocent pedestrians, 2 cats and 1 deer within just 13 minutes (only virtually of cause!), I realize, that operating any kind of machine at this moment wouldn´t be a very good idea… Going back to the TV.<BR>
T +5:51 After zapping around for a while, I find a documentary movie about the “Apollo Project”, underlayed with music from the 60s and 70s. As Apollo 10 takes off, I have a wave to +++ again. I am the rocket! This is really great. I switch on the beamer and the surround system for full cinematic experience. Wow! This is really like the state I´m in! I phantasize being an astronaut and flying into space. This is just the right stuff at the right time. <BR>
<BR>
T +6:44 The documentary movie is over. I´m getting a little tired again, but am still riding the waves. How long is this going to last? BP 158/91 mmHg, HF 92 bpm.<BR>
T +7:02 Very hungry all of a sudden. I realize that I haven´t eaten for more than 15 hours. I assist my sitter in making some pasta, which tastes surprisingly good, but isn´t enough for my hunger. I eat some crisps and some chocolate, but miss the point to stop… now the stomach discomfort is back!<BR>
T +7:41 Feeling a little better – and more tired. I´m coming down a little, but it´s still a good ++. Maybe the eating pushed the metabolism of the substances a little. BP 151/84 mmHg, HF 80 bpm.<BR>
T +8:05 Still a stabile ++. The visuals have become weaker, but there´s still a lot of morphing around me. Like in the beginning, some minor auditory distorsions. Once again I try the Nintendo, but find it to be unsatisfactory. Watching TV isn´t the best either, but I have no idea what to do with the rest of the night (or morning, actually it´s already 5:25 am!). <BR>
<BR>
T +8:40 Getting more and more tired, the same does my sitter. At + now. We decide to go to bed right now. First I think, that a little weed could help me sleep better, but as soon as I´m in bed, I realize it to be unnecessary. Within minutes I fall asleep, still at +. Very wild and vivid dreams.<BR>
<BR>
After 11 (!) hours I awake (at 5 pm), still a little numb, but finally out of the experience. After only 6 ½ hours, I have no problem going to bed again. Next day I wake up fresh and clear. <BR>
<BR>
Conclusions: <BR>
The 2C-B-Fly / Methylone combo is definitely worth further exploration. If 20mgs of Methylone have such an effect, how high could I go with, let´s say, 100mgs? If this was already a rocket to the moon, a higher dosage could easily lead to warp 9! I guess the next time, I´ll lower the 2C-B-Fly to 10-12mgs, but mix it with a higher Methylone dose ingested at the same time…<!--   End Body   -->

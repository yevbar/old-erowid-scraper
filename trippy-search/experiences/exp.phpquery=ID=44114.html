<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Warning: Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</FONT> <br>
<br>
[Erowid Note: This is an unconfirmed report of car wrecks related to inhalants. Let us know if you know of any information about this incident.]</div> <br>
<br>
This is a report of 3 seperate, but related experiences.  These are reports of a friend of mine.  I have done duster several times, and think it is not only fun, but safe if done responsibly and modestly.  When the lines of responsibility and ignorance collide, it can leave with a disasterous wake.    <br>
<br>
<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</FONT> <br>
<br>
Experience #1:  A 98 pontiac cruises down I-5.  Subject Z is on his way to work. He decides to take some duster hits before he has to deal with reality.  After 15 to 20 hits off the can (3 sets of 5 or 6 hits), the subject wakes up with his car wrapped around, and totaled on a tree.<br>
<br>
Experience #2:  Two months after the accident, Subject Z's girlfriend is doing the same as Z.  While driving down a highway, she rolls her car under the influence of an unspecified amount of duster (probably around 10-15 lungfulls taken as 5 sets of 3 hits).  She awakes upside down in an intersection.<br>
<br>
Experience #3:  It's easy to gather from the two preceding experiences that taking duster while driving may not be a safe avenue of fun practices.  Subject Z however, is not satisfied with the testing methods.  He decides to change the variable on the experiment from just duster to duster (20 hits), cannibis (smoked .5 grams), and two beers.  The control stays as the car, highway, and high speeds.  The experiment started at around 11:00 and was going nowhere till after midnight.  Z is passing through an intersection, lungs still full of duster goodness.  Everything goes black for him.  Upon awaking, Z finds his car is performing intercourse on the front of a nice family restaurant.  <br>
<br>
He gets charged with several counts and owes $20,000+ on the restaurant.  Just think a little bit before you wrap your lips around a nitrous can and put your foot to the pedal at the same time.<!--   End Body   -->

6:45pm Just dropped 10mg (5x 2mg) Lunesta. First I got my mouth and throat wet with water than filled mouth with chai soy milk and placed 5 pills into mouth with mouth still full of milk and downed all remnants in one gulp. Followed up with swig of water. The reason for such an odd ritual is to get rid of any chance of metallic aftertaste. This is my second time taking Lunesta with yesterday being the first at a dose of 4mg with no real noticable effects other than a slight visual effect that was no biggy on wall before bed. Let's see what happens. I think people that have had bad taste reaction to this med leave it in dry mouth before swallowing then lie down and yesterday I did my routine with absolutely no taste so it must be the reason.<br>
<br>
7:20pm  Getting a little light headed and euphoric but nothing too major yet. Calling up people is fun and messing with them.<br>
<br>
7:45pm (1hour!) Real mellow and goofy conversation on the phone. I will attempt to walk and get some grapes in the other room. <br>
<br>
8:00pm Really feeling it coming on in a very relaxing yet lazy way. I could close my eyes and rest but will stay awake to see what transpires next. Food seems to be very interesting.<br>
<br>
8:15pm (1 hour!) I'm bored gonna travel to a friend's to get a bong hit be right back.<br>
<br>
10:15pm (3.5 hours!) I'm back from going to a friends and smoking some kgb and drinking some heineken. I am feeling like I'm cracked out but mello at the same time probably the booze and weed. I'm buzzin pretty well at 1-10 about a 7.3. I have four beers and 3 x 2mg lunesta left. Which is barely over the rest of the worlds 7.65 because it's equal to lunesta 3.75gm whatever now comes the nitrous hit x two whipping cream cans new. The nitrous made me go way out there to the point I forgot where I was but closed my eyes and kept saying something about how we all fall to the ground falling once were we. <br>
<br>
10:34pm I ran into a ben & jerrys coffee heath bar crunch and am mesmarized by it. That lasted awhile and finished of a pint of it now with sugar buzz intact I can now do nothing for an hour till I take more pills then I will drink till then my four bears.<br>
<br>
10:46pm Everything is really mellow and I think music or tv sounds great, so why not both at the same time.<br>
<br>
11:03pm (4 hours!) Music is starting to really tell a story to me and then gets lost in translation not due to word misunderstandings but by the objective not being met yet I am transfixed to it's digital irregularities.<br>
<br>
11:10pm Dropped 6mg more to the mix dropped (4 1/2 hours! ago) of Lunestsa (16mg total). Drank it down with beer this time because I thought I will get the metallic taste because only 39% of the people that have taken this drug that they have interviewed said that they were... well I lost my point.<br>
<br>
11:15pm Finally finished the 3rd beer outta my six pack. I drank the other two earlier at my friends house (total 3 heineken). Everything is very coherent and yet very within hands reach with the adherence to joy in the galaxy in general.<br>
<br>
11:30pm Finished beer #4! yeah baby. Inserts Cabaret Voltaire C.O.D.E. CD, left the music up way too loud but didn't notice it myself so made some food and am currently eating 11:45pm.<br>
<br>
11:55pm Just ate a bunch more food. Mainly pealed oranges again and chocolate bars left over from halloween. Kinda goes good with beer though.<br>
<br>
12:00 Midnight and no metallic taste or anything of significance to point out as of yet nor do I think there will be soon either.<br>
<br>
12:07am (5 Hours!) I'm almost sober this is a very pathetic waste off time with meager results so far. Saved last beer for desperate late night sleep aid. I have taken 16 mg of Lunesta for the second time only have I used this product the first being 4mg the night before with no real benefits. Oh how I could eat anything right now which is mainly due to my friends gnarly ganja. Never been such a pig before now 12:14 am.<br>
<br>
12:05pm or am whatever, ride the wave with me it so backward with it's own little imperferctions. I'm not sure what happened to all the beers altough I may have finished them all. I am being underwhelmed and that's too bad. Sure I'm buzzed but I need to be gliding in the cosmos relocated to the incubated joint.<br>
<br>
;;;haha found the sixth beer and it's goin down asap 12:31.<br>
<br>
Well outta everything but food and sleep to come soon I hope. I destroyed another rx in a matter of minutes, I sure do wonders.<br>
<br>
12:58 am Just ate another huge meal and am ready to pass out from tonight.<br>
<br>
1:13am Screw this I'm not evened buzzed enough to pass out so I'm gonna snort 2mg xanax.<br>
<br>
1:25am Xanax is starting to kick in. No more Lunesta for me it's week and ineffective.<br>
<br>
9:00am Woke up feeling pretty mellow. Those xanax knocked me right out for 7 hours straight.<br>
<br>
Conclusion - Lunesta is not a recreational drug like say Ambien is. I derieved absolutely no visuals or even a any loss of time or amnesia. Not even with a six pack of beer was I tired till I took the two xanax then it was lights out Irene. Lunesta is not a very good sleep aid nor any fun at all. Boo.<!--   End Body   -->

Preface:<br>
<br>
I came across Percocets through a friend earlier this evening. I've had significant drug experience, but not too much in the pain-killer/opiate class. I've done way too much DXM, enough cocaine, lots of methylphenidate, (prefix of your choice)amphetamine, THC containing things (pot), 5-meo-dipt, nitrous, benzo's (valium, etc.), salvia and a plethora of other more subtle psychoactive chemicals. I've never had an addiction to anything 'cept my precious Newport cigarettes; exploring psychoactives is a big part of my life, in a not-so-unhealthy way. Obviously, I wouldn’t turn down something that I had access too.<br>
<br>
Experience:<br>
<br>
Not knowing what to expect, I decided to try and play it safe, by popping the pill (5mg Oxycodone, 325mg Acetaminophen) before a 30 minute drive to visit a friend in the city, so that by the time it takes effect I won't be driving. I down the pill at about 10:10pm. A friend with me also takes one, half for curiousity and half for the ache in his back. After about ten minutes, we proceed to leave for the city. At around 10:45, I start to feel the effects. The best way I have to describe how it came on is as follows: Much like what happens when I smoke pot, I sort of pre-imagine the onset of the drug, then, I'll snap out of it, and think 'Wow, I actually *am* this fucked up.'<br>
<br>
<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</FONT><br>
<br>
It was a really subtle come-on. Driving through downtown on the express-way, with the lights sort of blurring around me, combined with the very trance-like music playing seemed to be really 'perfect' at the time. Mentally, the feeling was the sort of 'all-is-well', amazingly happy and at peace feeling that MDMA gives me. Things were sort of slightly out of touch, in a mild stoned manner. Physically, my legs had a weird light feeling in them; same feeling you get when you get out of the car after a long trip, etc. I felt a bit warmer physically, and things seemed 'light' and 'bouncy', vaguely like stimulants.<br>
<br>
When I got out of the car, the high seemed to vanish, as I entered the 'real world' again. Once inside an apartment, the warmth and slurred nature of reality sort of crept back. It was very pleasent since it retained clarity and none of the confusion and out-of-touch feeling that pot and alcohol have. The cross between a definate downer and clarity resembled the feeling of Valium or Xanax. At about 11:45, I decided to take another pill since the first was kind of fading (or so it seemed). After taking the pill we decided to walk around the city.<br>
<br>
Again, when I went outside, the high seemed to vanish. It crept back after a while though, lacking the warm, good feeling, mainly just a kind of disassociated benzo feeling. It was really mild, very pleasent and interesting though. I noticed, while looking at an oddly shaped building the amazing clarity of things. It was almost like everything was razor sharp, but only when I mentally focused on it. Things I didn't focus on seemed mildly blurred, both vision and perception wise.<br>
<br>
The second pill didn't really seem to boost off of the first pill, it just kept the slightly fading high from fading. By about 12:45 I seemed to really come-down. Out of the blue, I just slipped into being VERY tired. I was inside a diner at the time, and my stomach started to hurt. I chewed two 20mg methylphenidate slow release pills to combat the fatigue. They took affect rather quickly and made me feel much better.<br>
<br>
We left shortly, and were walking on the streets again. Just like before, the high faded, as did the unpleasentness and the being tired. I was definetly fine to drive the entire experience, and drove home just about as high as I was on the way there. Music was very pleasent and soothing, conversation was kind of annoying, I didn't seem to have the patience to keep a conversation.<br>
<br>
When I arrived home I was still vaguely feeling the Percocet. After the pretty short 'high', it seemed to leave a relatively long-last, very mild feeling. I snorted 30mg methylphenidate and half of a crushed Percocet to sort of put me back at borderline :)<br>
<br>
The methylphenidate took affect quickly and boosted off the orally ingested methylphenidate to put me in a slightly speedy state. As of this time (T+6 hours after the original Percocet was ingested), I still feel VERY mild effects of the Percocet and a slow come-down from the methylphenidate. Not a bad way to spend an evening.<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
<br>
I found Percocets to be way overhyped, and nothing like what I expected. Overall it was similar to a low/medium dose of valium with a kind of pleasent, sleepy, light feeling added. Another good comparison would be a very, very mild MDMA trip. Overall, worth trying, worth trying again, but not something I would put a lot of effort in trying to acquire. Fun was had by all, though.<!--   End Body   -->

<!--   Start Body   -->


So yesterday, my good friend “W” sent me a text when he was visiting his buddies out of town. He texted me to inform me about this legal incense called “King Kong.” His text informed me on how great this substance was. He started off by ranting on about how strong and insane this high was compared to other legal highs such as Kush, 42 Degrees, Krypto, ect. But the most accurate way he described it was like he was tripping on a small dosage of LSD or mushrooms. He also added that he only took a pinch of this substance which he smoked from the tip of his cigarette. I was very confused as to how a legal incense could have such a strong effect in such a small dosage. <br>
<br>
So the next day he bought 3 grams of this “King Kong” and invited me over to try it. Now of course Im not going to give up an opportunity to try this, so I meet up with him at his apartment at 7:30 pm.  We grab the bong and load a decent sized bowl. (Im guessing around .4 of a gram) As he was about to start it off, he pauses and says to me, “Dude, Im literally scared to take 2 hits.” So he ends up receiving a text at the time he said that and set the bong down, I snatch it from across the table and said “Fuck it” and took one of the biggest hit of my life, cleared the elephant bowl, and took another fairly large hit. As I exhaled the hit from my lungs my entire body almost instantly felt 20 pounds heavier. I passed the bong and while I was laughing I said, “I IMMEDIATELY regret my decision W!” It was very funny at the time but 3 minutes later I found myself unable to comprehend language, similar to a DXM trip. At that time I was also unable to hold my head up. So I rest my head on the table. The last feeling I had before I started really tripping was also similar to DXM. While I rested my head on the table I felt at peace with myself. I slipped into a dream-state where everything happened so quickly with very little detail. <br>
<br>
I felt like I was having a great time; really high, tripping slightly, 3 more friends come over, everything was all good. As the stories around the table started to die down, I stand up and decide to walk a few feet and sit on the ground against a wall looking at the table. (I usually stand up after a while and see how interesting it is to walk so heavily intoxicated sometimes :) ) Since I went to sit down, W and Friend number 1 (F1) came over to sit down in front of me to talk. <br>
<br>
While W and F1 are exchanging various thoughts, I snap back into reality. Struggling to keep my eyes open I think back at what just happened. I cant remember. I blacked out for who knows how long but I recollect certain aspects to what I couldn’t remember. (Such as my mood, and my actions I listed above) I had a horrible sense of embarrassment as I try to listen to W and find out what had just happened. F1 stands up and goes into another room where F2 and F3 are talking. They sound very concerned and I think F1 went in to update them on how I was doing. At that time I knew something had happened and I don’t remember. <br>
<br>
As Im still waking up, trying to control my body from loosing all muscle control, W gets water and F1, F2, and F3 see everything is under control so they can leave now knowing I was alright. About 10 minutes after they left I feel much better, good enough to talk, or at least whisper. The first thing I asked is “Whats going on W?” I don’t exactly remember his response. I get the sense that he almost ignored what I was asking and instead continued asking me how I was doing, if I was alright, and so on. <br>
<br>
8:00pm <br>
<br>
W tells me what actually happened. Supposedly while I was still recuperating from the massive bong rips he said I rested my head down and went unconscious. He walked across the table and tried to wake me up. He lifted my head up and my eyes were rolled to the back of my head and I was drooling vomit, struggling to breathe. W immediately laid me down on my side to help open my air flow and eliminate the chance of me choking on my own throw-up. (W is a licensed life guard and swim instructor, so I wouldn’t have rather had anyone else be there) I was unconscious for 15 minutes and he was minutes away from calling an ambulance. I was shocked. I didn’t believe him until I started to come down from the high, 45 minutes later. <br>
<br>
8:30pm <br>
<br>
When I finally felt good enough I had completely forgotten about who else was here when this was happening. I asked W who the other people were who had come over for a bit. He looked at me strange and replied with, “Dude, nobody else was here, remember, J and M couldn’t make it?” <br>
<br>
I was absolutely shocked. I still cant soak in what happened to me, it seems too unreal to me. I had blacked-out and dreamed other company was there, and I had talked to them and they had watched all that happen. That immediately answered why I had a horrible sense of embarrassment when I had woken up. I felt that they were there and they had to go through watching me almost die. <br>
<br>
Now I have a few possibilities as to how and why this happened. The state I was in when I was unconscious is very similar to a dream I had caused by new medication I was prescribed, Prozac (Fluoxitine). The dream was in no way similar to my experience but the feeling I had when I had woke up was the exact same. I had a feeling of completely believing the dream was true, being in the dream, feelings, emotions, actually believing it happened recently! The other possibility was maybe the incense kicked in the LSD I had ingested 36 hours before.<br>
<br>
Either way that is the worst experience I had ever had and I never want to have my good friend go through something of that severity ever again. This is the first time I considered reporting an experience but I felt that lots of people are uneducated on how strong and horrible a legal incense can be.<br>
<br>
Be fun and safe everyone!<!--   End Body   -->

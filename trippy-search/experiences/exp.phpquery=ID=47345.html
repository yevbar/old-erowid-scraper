My last mushroom trip before shrooms were made a Class A drug here in the UK was easily one of the most profound, incredible experiences of my life to date.<br>
<br>
I was at my best friend A's flat. We had bought the shrooms for what seemed like a very good deal, (200g for £40), and we were planning to split them between the two of us. The setting was A's room and was very good, having had many good trips there before. We were very much looking forward to the strong shroom trip to come. Music and a Giger book were made accessible, and candles and incense were lit.<br>
<br>
In the evening, around 7, we dosed on 2g of Syrian Rue each. Around 20-30 minutes later, when we felt this begin to kick in, we began to eat some of the shrooms. I enjoy tripping at night, in the dark. We washed the shrooms down with a few beers; they weren't particularly bad tasting, just large (the largest I've seen) and tough.<br>
<br>
I got through around 70g before I had to have a break; a few very large shrooms were left. I could already feel myself beginning to come up as I finished eating the shrooms. We smoke a joint after finishing eating, to add to the shroom effects and reduce any nausea.<br>
<br>
Around 40 minutes after dosing with the mushrooms I was already very spaced out, maybe more so then I had been on shrooms before. Another friend, B, had only a single large shroom and got strong effects from it. The effects continued to build over time.<br>
<br>
The intensity of the trip was mind blowing; I had no previous experience that was in the same league as this. The open eye visuals were incredible, large, dark pulsating, liquid. They remind me of visuals I had seen on Ayahuasca once (the one time I had got it to work), they were of a similar style. With eyes closed the space inside my head was a vast, dark space with amazingly vivid and intricately coloured visuals constantly in motion.<br>
<br>
I came close to complete ego loss, which is something I've never experienced on any of my various trips. I forgot everything about my life up until that point, and I seemed to have temporarily escaped the confines of my head and body. I was repeatedly asking my friend A what was going on. He was also tripping very heavily.<br>
<br>
It got weird when the shrooms began to seriously affect my emotions. I'm a lot more vulnerable in this state to emotions, thoughts, and memories. I would erupt into serious fits of crying, near spontaneous, and then into fits of laughter, literally alternating within seconds.<br>
<br>
My friend A helped steer me away from that part of the trip, and we smoke a joint. I find marijuana to be very pleasurable with psychedelics. It enhances the high, giving a flush of warm energy through my system, and it boosts the colour and intensity of the visuals. It also calms my mind, which can be useful if my mind is dwelling on dark thoughts in a trip. A strange and curious thing I noticed was the way I observed myself in this state. Due to the depth of the intoxication, I observed myself as a mammal that had consumed some fungus, and that’s all I could work with. Have never experienced anything like this before.<br>
<br>
After that part of the trip was over (the earliest part of a strong trip, when still coming up, can sometimes be a bit challenging), I was in an excellent state of mind. I kept asking my friend what was going on, because I was on a completely different plane with amazing visuals.<br>
<br>
My friend B played the didgeridoo, which sounded amazing in this state. Music [Shpongle, 13th Floor Elevators etc.] was very enhanced. B's girlfriend had an orgasmatron, this thing with metallic arms that messages your head. The stimulation from this was very intense, felt weird.<br>
<br>
I was by far the highest I've ever been. I was in strong physical and mental ecstasy. This was so intense that I was hyper ventilating and at times I felt orgasmic over my entire body. The high was made better by the fact that it felt so natural and earthy, they make me glow with health. The trip lasted around 8 hours.<br>
<br>
All in all, an incredible experience, and one that I would very much like to repeat in the future. Just a shame that shrooms are illegal here now. Still can and have got hold of more since. I'm tempted to go to the Philippines and take them there.<!--   End Body   -->

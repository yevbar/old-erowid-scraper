<FONT COLOR="#CC9900">[Erowid Warning: The following report documents the ingestion of an unusually high and potentially dangerous dose of 2C-B.  We have chosen to include this report to help document the dose range, but its inclusion does not imply that this dose is safe.]</font><BR>
<BR>
First, off, a word to the wise.  Anyone can just sell a capsule filled with some colored powdered and claim to know how much it is.  Definately not the case.  While this conclusion seems easy to make, it proved to be true for me, even though I was the one measuring it!  Let me explain.<BR>
<BR>
Upon obtaining one gram of 2C-B a few weeks ago, I could hardly contain my excitement as my friend IM'd me at work to let me know that things were all good.  Arriving home, I immediately got out my MX-50 digital scales, which I had procurred because of their hundreth to the gram accuracy and compactness.  For about 120 dollars with shipping, simply the best purchase i have ever made.  After getting used to measuring out 350mg DXM pills on a regular basis, I didn't even give it a second though as I filled an empty gelatin capsule with 2C-B.  25mgs right?  Sounds good to me.  My friend and I each popped one, and immediately left to go to my friends house, who was having a small get together. <BR>
<BR>
Things were going well, and everyone was having fun.  I had brought my bong with me, and it was passed to me with a kb hit packed, ready to go.  I could already feel something coming on, an intense feeling of energy that was flowing through my nervous system like electricity.  Definately a good feeling, something that I could relate to a strong +400 microgram hit of acid, but which was decidedly different at the same time.  Anyways, after what seemed like eternity from the bong being passed to me, I proceeded to take a bong hit and hold it while I passed it to my friend.  I held it in longer then my friend, who smokes cigerattes, and when I finally exhaled, I almost seemed to have the feeling go away.  Silly me of course, it had been a little over an hour and a half at this point, and I hadn't even plateaued yet.<BR>
<BR>
Probably only 5 seconds went by before I could feel the THC hit my brain and absolutely skyrocket me into the next world.  Up till this point, things were decidedly liquid in nature.  After this, colors seemed to just explode around me, and everythig auditory began to become very loud and form echoes.  Upon later reflection, it wasn't echos that I was hearing, but rather what I was perceiving as the minute differences in time that it took various noises from the party to reach both my ear canals.  After looking at my host's girlfriend and the turning to him, probably a 45 degree turn of my head, and having the colors of one face blend like water into the other, I knew it was time to go.  Looking at my friend confirmed this.  Being much less experienced at psychadelics then I, my friend was how should we say, toast.  Abruptly letting my host know that I had to be going right now this very second, I got up and urged my friend to follow.  Standing up was amazing, I was totally weightless and felt like I was walking on air.<BR>
<BR>
It wasn't uncomfortable or frightening in any way, just very disorienting and fun at the same time.  Letting everyone know I was leaving as I stumbled from the house, we quickly made our way home.  By this time, the visuals were incredibly intense, nothing I had ever experienced before, except for high level 1500+ DXM trips, but this was totally different; whereas DMX is like a pure mental trip and a lightshow for you head, 2C-B was playing with reality in a way I had never witnessed before.  Luckily we arrived home safely (never, ever drive on psychadelics, please!) and got into my apartment without incident.  <BR>
<BR>
Firing up winamp proved to be great fun, but the visualizations that I had always loved watching while sober proved to be boring and dissapointing.  My Mac laptop had some interesting ones as well, probably more due to the crisp color of an LCD screen then a CRT.  However, my roomie soon went to bed, saying it was that time.  This was in between the hysterical laughter however, as everything proved to be just too funny.  Toonies, indeed, I felt like I was in a Who Framed Roger Rabbit film.  It really had such mystical qualities.  After it was quiet, some classical music and meditating proved to be one of the most rewarding experiences ever.<BR>
<BR>
Never have I had such motivation to just chill, and let the energy in my body, and especially my brain, flow in and out like water.  A kb hit an hour from my bubbler (I had left my bong in the care of my host since I had the sudden feeling we had to leave immediately) proved to just keep making things better.  The rest of the night proved uneventful, if I could call it that.  I went to work the next day, did a full 8 hours, without a wink of sleep from the night before.  What was strange, but definately cool, I didn't have that edgy, burnt out type feeling I get from high LSD trips, and certainly not from MDMA, although pure, if one can find it, is not nearly as bad the day after.  <BR>
<BR>
A week later or so, I went to my gram to measure out two more doses of 25mgs, and after doing so, I was thinking to myself, 'Gosh, there is no way this could be a gram, I'm almost out, and I haven't even measured out more then 4 yet.'  After much pondering  and questioning, I discovered to my horror (or delight?) that I had indeed measured out 250mg, not 25.  Was it possible that I had done so the first time?  That would certainly explain the event of what could possibly be the most intense single trip I have ever had, especially from what I had thinking it was one hit.  How could this be possible?  I had never read anywhere of anybody doing that much before.  No way, I thought, couldn't be.<BR>
<BR>
After about 30 minutes of checking my scale and going back and looking online and  referring to some math tables just to make sure, that was indeed what I had done.  I had gotten so used to measuring out DXM hits, with multiple 100 gram doses, that I hadn't even thought twice about it when I measured out the doses.  Simply seeing 25 on the scale was enough for me.  However, a decimal point is a big deal.  I then also realized since my scale is accurate to one hundredth of a gram, the 5 in 25 wouldn't show, just the 20.  Damn, wish I had a scale to the thousandth of a gram!!!  I internally scolded myself for being so careless and absent minded.  I didn't mind taking that much, but what if my friend had seriously wigged out or gotten hurt?<BR>
<BR>
I vowed to watch things much more carefully.  I can understand how people overdose on 2C-T-7 so easily now.  Crazy stuff, but awesome at the same time.  Would I do that again?  Hell yea, but not for a while and not very often (thats expensive ya know?)  I correctly measured out a precise 25mg dose, and to my delight, I had a wonderful experience.  Not the intense visual/auditory trip the first time, but definately a good time with lots of energy and color flowing together with music and friends alike.  Highly recommended, just watch your measurements please!!!<!--   End Body   -->

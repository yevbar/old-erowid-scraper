<!--   Start Body   -->


A group of friends and I had been contemplating trying cocaine for quite some time. Once the talk of it became too exciting, we finally arranged the purchase of 4 grams from a local source. The week before we actually tried the drug, I did a lot of heavy-duty reseach on-line. I learned everything I ever wanted to know about where cocaine came from, what it did to the body, and how I would feel the next day. I also spent a lot of time talking to people who had already tried the drug as well as reading personal accounts of coke usage. I felt like I had really done my homework on the matter, and on top of that, I was really excited to try it.<BR>
<BR>
Overwhelmingly, I read or heard of people having amazing experiences on coke; nearly everyone spoke of a feeling of euphoric bliss, an increased libido, and the urge to talk, talk, talk! I was ready to try the drug and experience for myself all the wonders I had been researching.<BR>
<BR>
On saturday, a group of friends and I made our way to a neutral location to ride the white pony all night long. We dumped the white rocks onto a mirror and cut it with a razor until we had the perfect powder consistency. I cut a line, rolled a $20 bill and snorted. It was so smooth, I expected the first time to be less comfortable than it turned out to be. I waited for everyone else to get a line and then we went around for the second nostril. About 15 minutes or so later, I started to feel really good. I was extremely happy, loving and care-free...I felt like a million bucks. But it was nothing like I had expected. The whole time I was waiting for one distinct moment when I would feel a rush of euphoria wash over my body. That never happened, instead it just kind of manifested itself in the form of extreme comfortability with the people I was with. Time did not progress as it usually does. That was probably one of the most bizarre aspects of the drug; the whole night just seemed to fly by, yet we did so much. We talked for hours, walked for hours, and all in all just enjoyed each others company all night long. <BR>
<BR>
There was no option of sleep...coke gets me so hyped up, that I literally cannot sit still. And even when I do, my body will continue to maintain an elevated heart rate. It was like exercising without moving my body. There was also absolutely no desire for food. I was on the drug for 8 hours total and did not need to eat for 12 hours after my last line. But as expected, the drug started to wear off about an hour or so after the last line. I still felt good, no signs of depression or the need (not want) to do more. Unfortunately, everyone else was beginning to come down, some were really  irritable and others just seemed down. Indirectly, this made me feel a bit depressed, so we decided to do some more lines. After this, the happy feelings came back and everyone was back to talking and having a great time. We continued snorting until we all had had at least 200 mg. At some point within this large time frame, I started to get super paranoid, but because I knew to expect it, I could somewhat disregard the feelings. <BR>
<BR>
At this point, I started feeling like I was enjoying the lines a lot more than everyone else, and in my head, I thought everyone was staring at me and thinking what a big cokehead I was. I couldn't stop looking around the room at everyone to make sure they weren't glaring at me. This was very strange to me because I am usually such a calm person, but all of a sudden I became so paranoid and my palms started sweating and I couldn't stop moving my feet. Another side effect was extreme dry mouth. I found that I was constantly sniffing, which caused me to swallow uncontrollably. I couldn't stop swallowing to save my life, and water wasn't really working, so, in my current state, I decided to swallow lubricant (the edible kind of course), and amazingly, it worked like a charm. It coated my throat and tongue and kept the uncomfortable dry mouth at bay. I would also recommend chewing gum, although alone, it does not work as well as with lubricant.<BR>
All in all, I did not suffer from post-cocaine usage depression, nor did I feel that bad in the morning, but then again, I hadn't slept a wink. My heart rate was still elevated in the morning when I tried to go to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
Eventually I slept, but not for long and with lots of startling awakenings form the slightest sound (residual paranoia...). Another thing I did not feel was the urge to do another line. I can honestly say that I will never have to do cocaine again, whether or not I want to is a totally different story. I would offer the following advice to all those contemplating using coke: it is a very powerful drug, but nothing is more powerful than one's own willpower. Know that the drug is not physically addictive, rather, it is very pschyologically addictive. So be very careful and do not misinterpret the desire to do more coke as a need for it. It is very possible to do coke once or often and never form a dependancy on the drug, one just has to be extremely careful with what one is dealing with. Cocaine is not an escape from the mundane aspects of everyday life. I implore people not to use this drug if they are depressed or trying to hide from  problems, which will only perpetuate themselves into an even larger and more dangerous ordeal. But if they are relatively stable and interested in trying something that will make them feel like a king or queen, I suggest cocaine. <BR>
<BR>
The after effects seems relatively small compared to the euphoria felt while on the drug. Just remember: treat cocaine and all drugs with the respect they deserve.<!--   End Body   -->

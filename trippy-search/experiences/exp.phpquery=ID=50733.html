A buddy of mine has a shrink who seems to have little reservation when it comes to writing prescriptions.  So over the years my friend has accumulated a pretty impressive stock of pharmaceuticals.  One night when we had nothing to do and little desire to go out, we decided to open his treasure chest of prescription drugs and give the most recent addition of Ambien a try.<br>
<br>
I don't actually remember much from that night, but from the videos we took of ourselves and with some first-hand accounts from sober friends, I pieced together one of the stranger nights of my existence.  We each popped a 10mg pill around 9:15 p.m. and then just for the hell of it we each downed some rum.  The drug began kicking in around 15 minutes later.  I felt pretty subdued and it was difficult to concentrate on what I was reading.  After that point things began to get hazy.  I know I popped another 10mg pill at the 45 minute mark and two more pills sometime after that.  I also smoked through 1g of pot sometime before I crashed around one or two in the morning.<br>
<br>
While on this cocktail of drugs I remember experiencing hallucinations.  I recall at one point my group (my friend with the Ambien, myself, and my roommate who joined us about an hour in) made its way down to the darkened gymnasium where the wrestling mats were laid out for a recent tournament.  I turned toward my roommate and instead of seeing my roommate, I saw a monster.  When he returned my stare I immediately became frightened and I gave him a violent shove.  He later added that I had him in a headlock so tight he felt his head was about to burst.  We left when a security guard came in to tell us that the gym was closed.<br>
<br>
My friend who supplied the Ambien had not taken it before and he also rarely uses any recreational drugs.  Therefore his tolerance for any sort of mind altering substance is quite low.  One event I had to be informed of the next morning was how I had to carry him up a flight of stairs to my room because he was in no situation to do so himself. <br>
<br>
One of the strangest memories I have of the night involved watching a porno with my friends.  If that's not odd enough, I'll inform you it was the most bizarre film I have ever seen.  It involved a couple gentlemen being sodomized by a dozen women with huge jet-black dildos.  Why we found this to be entertaining is beyond my comprehension, but I sure hope it doesn't suggest that we have a latent desire for that sort of sexual activity!<br>
<br>
Despite my patchy memory of the night, I had a great time.<!--   End Body   -->

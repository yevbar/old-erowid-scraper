<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: 23 grams of oral Cannabis is considered an extremely high dose, and may cause very difficult experiences and/or illness]</FONT><br>
<br>
College was definately a time for me to experiment with a large assortment of drugs.  This particular experience is one that will more than likely stick with me for the rest of my life.<br>
<br>
It was a typical day for me living in a college residence.  I awoke at 9:30am and proceeded outside to enjoy a joint of approximately 1 gram of weed; which was a daily ritual.  Upon returning to my dorm, I realised that I had no more dope for the day!  No problem...a phone call, a trip to the ATM, and an hour later, I was back in business with an ounce of some nice medium-high grade bud.<br>
<br>
It was around 11am and I was in a strange mood.  I was in the mood to do something really extreme.  Then I got an idea.  I called up my friend who lived down the hall from me, let's call him Mike (for the sake of making this story easier to follow), and the two of us went to the nearest grocery store.  Once there, we headed striaght for the baking aisle and began to look around for the best candidate to assist our baking desires.  The selection was limited, but we managed to find a half decent box of brownie mix that also included icing.  We then picked up some eggs, milk, and butter, then headed on our way.<br>
<br>
After we had returned to residence, we read the directions on the box carefully and discovered that you could add more flour to the mix to make a larger batch.  All you had to do was add more eggs and butter in certain purportions in order to keep the right consistancy.  Then, a problem occured to us; we can't cook them in residence or the whole place is going to reak of dope.  So we went for another short walk across the street, this time we headed over to a friends appartment.  We were just about to walk into the building when we ran into him outside.  Let's call him John.<br>
<br>
I explained to John what Mike and I were intending on doing and he was completely psyched about it.  Although I had yet to tell him how much we intended on putting in the brownies.  As it turns out, he was having one of the worst days of his life and this was just what he needed.<br>
<br>
When we got into his appartment, I told him that I had an ounce to make these brownies with.  He was a little surprised, but then he started thinking.  He told us to wait where we were and he'd be right back.  At this point Mike had to leave for class, so he bailed.  Shortly after, John returned and told me that he would pitch in an ounce as well!  That's 2 ounces!  It was about 4pm by the time we started cooking.<br>
<br>
To prepare them, all we did is put all the pot into a coffee grinder and grind it up until it was a very fine powder.  Then mixed all of it (and the crystal that was in the grinder) into the brownie mix.  Of course, we added the right amount of extra butter, eggs, and milk to the mix so that the brownies wouldn't be too dry.  We ended up making 2 trays of brownies.  These were completely done and ready to eat by 5:30pm.  Before we started eating, we each grabbed a quarter ounce of dope to smoke while we were eating.  We were reading to start eating at 6pm.<br>
<br>
We cut each tray of brownies into approximately 30 small pieces.  We each saved 5 pieces to give our friends, and then proceeded to eat once piece every five minutes.  We finished eating the brownies by 8:45pm.  We would take occassional brakes to smoke a few bowls from his glass bong.<br>
<br>
At about 7:30, I was dying for a smoke, so i stood up to go outside and have a cig.  Until this point, I hadn't really paid any attention to how the brownies were affecting me.<br>
<br>
Once I stood up, I was completely floored by the feeling that overcame me.  I was very light-headed and everything around me seemed very interesting.  As I walked outside, I felt as if my movements were very fluid like.  Once outside, I looked up at the stars and I felt as if I were falling into the sky.  I lit my cigarette, and from the first puff until the last it tasted absolutely amazing.  I felt extremely relaxed, but I wasn't tired or burnt out.  I then went back inside and we finished off the brownies.<br>
<br>
After all the brownies were gone and had fully kicked in we sat and chilled for a while.  All sense of time was completely gone.  I can try to explain the feeling I got from this, but I honestly don't think there are any words to describe it.  I was extremely euphoric.  The world outside seemed like an amazing place in which anything and everything was possible.  Everything had a very positive vibe to it.  Everything was very relaxed and fluid.  It was unbelievable.  It was extremely intense, but it never felt so intense that it wasn't enjoyable.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I can't even begin to accurately describe the feeling I got from these brownies.  One has to be willing to spend a couple hundred dollars or so on a single experience.  But I plan on doing it again once I have the spare cash.  Nothing compares to it.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, one last thing.  I went to bed that night at around 1am.  When I woke up at 9:30am, I was still VERY high.  I felt fairly sketched out for the rest of the day, but i was still high for a few hours after I woke up.  Anyways, long story, I know, but I wish everyone could experience what I did.  I would have loved to get into more details about all the other cool things that happend that night, but this is pretty lengthy as it is!<!--   End Body   -->

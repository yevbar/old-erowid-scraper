This is not an account of any one time encounter with drinking; it is what I can recall of letting myself go over the edge with a substance.<BR>
<BR>
Before my junior year of high school all I knew about alcohol was that I had a good tolerance to it; I could handle a lot more than some adults I knew without getting any real effects.  I was 17 at the time and having recently discovered how great pot was I was just open to anything that made me feel high.  The first few times I tried drinking it was just awesome; a lot like being really stoned but much more overwhelming and with a real strong euphoria.  I never got any negative effects like hangovers, and I never puked at all back in those days.  At one point I got a bottle of Everclear and kept that in my house for rare occasions; I could mix a shot or two of it with some sort of juice, smoke a bowl, and expect a great night.  At this time it was such an uncommon experience for me that every time was the same great drunk feeling.  <BR>
<BR>
When school let out and summer started is when I really got into it though.  Up until this point I got drunk in some way, but it was more like being very 'sociably drunk'; I had never actually experienced the full blown intoxication stage.  During my birthday was my first chance at this.  A friend of mine came over with a fifth of whiskey; this we mixed with lemonade (with a sour-mash whiskey it is just delicious) and watched Natural Born Killers, to this day one of my all time favorites.  <BR>
<BR>
Midway through the movie I really felt it hit: it was like an intense head rush and I felt completely liquid, when I tried to stand up to piss I walked/jogged in a fast, half-stumbling gate, I would look at myself in the mirror and laugh at my reflection telling it how drunk it was.  At the end of the movie I was just fucked and must have blacked out; my friend says I told him I was going upstairs to get some blankets but I never came back, he found me passed out still in my clothes in the morning.  That liquid feeling was the best thing I'd ever felt, and I got it again a few weeks later at a party.  I hit a keg like 6 or 7 times and had some whiskey in the course of two hours or so, and then went back to a friends house to smoke and take some shots (probably 5 or 6).  He was still sober enough so he drove me back home afterward.  By the time I got home I was wasted: I was trying to watch a movie and drink some more (don't know why) and I had spinning double vision; I felt dizzy trying to keep up with the movie and turned it off, but then after sitting in the dark for five minutes I forgot why and turned it back on, this ended in my puking from apparently induced motion sickness.  <BR>
<BR>
After those experiences the peak effects of alcohol slowly declined into nothing over the next few months.  I loved drinking so much I started doing it every weekend and actually got bored with pot because it wasn't as strong; I realized how cheap 40's are and this became my number one suggestion of what to do with the day, with two bucks I was good.  I soon amassed enough whiskey in my room to sustain me getting drunk alone every night if I wanted, and this I did.  My dose was half a bottle, mixed with soda, lemonade, or something along those lines.  <BR>
<BR>
Up until this point the only sort of hangover I got felt a lot like being high or just still drunk but less so, thus I would smoke a bowl in the morning to come back up and have a good (albeit slow) day.  Soon this turned into my mom buying me 40's when school started back up; I would just drink during the weekends, every saturday night.  A few times I got curious and decided to get more beer than usual so I'd get really wasted; more than two 80 ounces of malt liquor is a bad idea just so you know.  I did some awefully stupid stuff when I got that trashed, a lot of it is just too ridiculous to waste more space here on.  <BR>
<BR>
The last time I ever tried it was the worst I've ever been: I can very vaguely recall returning from the bathroom and falling over the back of the couch making a huge crash which woke everyone up, but not really seeming to attach any significance to it, my mom said she came down several times that night and I was passed out somewhere, a couple times I was unrousable for a few minutes.  I did fall on my face in front of her when I was finally headed for bed, for most of the night I had been only half conscious, but somehow I had woken up a bit since then and was now very aware of my extreme state, thus this was pretty damn sad.  <BR>
<BR>
After that is when I realized I wasn't enjoying the hangovers as a free high anymore, they were really gross now and I just got a bad headache.  The drunk part itself had all became mundane just like pot had after I abused it; the experience itself is always the same, it's still pleasurable, but nothing is ever knew and exciting about it.  Now I won't let myself get too drunk because I just get every debilitating effect possible from it, and at some point puke my guts out; I have to chug water to rehydrate and ward off hangovers which results in being bloated for a while, and I wake up still feeling fuzzy and out-of-it.  Many people debate hotly with me when I say I was an alcoholic for a while; they claim you can't be an addict for a little while and just snap out of it, especially because I still drink from time to time now.  I know for myself I was at that point though; I couldn't go one day without getting some juice in my body, I even had a friend over once who wouldn't drink and just sat around while I got drunk all night becuase I needed it.  I never binged too heavily or too long so I never got tremors or anything, but I was certainly an addict.  <BR>
<BR>
Alcohol to me now is a lot like pot except still much stronger and more overwhelming, it also is much more inebriating.  When I drink now I do it smart, that way I don't end up doing something stupid.<!--   End Body   -->

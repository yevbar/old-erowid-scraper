This was my 3rd or 4th tryst with DXM. Me and my friend were gonna try to hit 1000mg. (He did, I was just 42mg under). We got to my friends house with the supply of DXM products. I proceeded to slowly take the pills while watching TV, my friend chugged his two bottles and swallowed his pills slowly along with me. I was done taking the pills. I chugged half the bottle of syrup and saved the rest for later so that I could trip harder by introducing the DXM more slowly. We shut off his lights and watched TV until the trip started. When it really hit, I could see in matrix code. I was convinced that I was The One. We layed down on his big bed and started the CEV parade. I don't remember anything of what I saw at first. I opened my eyes after what could have been 10 minutes. 10 minutes was an eternity by this time. I chugged the rest of the bottle (I thought there was a bit left in it, but the next day there was just some water [we still haven't figured out how water got into it]). I went back to my spot on the bed and closed my eyes again. <BR>
<BR>
I was in the matrix universe again. I was the machines, but in a different way. I was a giant omnipitant being made up of all the machines. My robo itch also affected my trip. As I itched my body, with my eyes closed, I could see the giant machine version of me scratching itself. As it did this, patches of little machines would fall off the places that were just scratched. I had glimpses of Trinity and Neo, but they made no sense. I could see snapshots of their faces, but they weren't actually there in my machine world, yet I could feel their presence. I opened my eyes. Everything in the room that I could see was zooming around. My world was spinning. I told my friend to grab his trashcah, and I hurled.<BR>
<BR>
All the DXM had already been absorbed by my body so puking didn't decrease the trip at all. I layed back down and closed my eyes. I was being carried away on a platform of purple glowing heads. The heads were Naiobe, Morpheus, Ghost, and some other people. I was seeing myself being carried away in the third person. I was watching from above. The platform carried me through the wall I was lying against, and I could feel myself go through it even though I was no longer in my body. I'm not quite sure what happened for a while after that, but when I was aware of everything agiain, I was convinced I was a female director directing elaborate underwear commercials. I was directing one particular commercial about dalmation pattern underwear in a ballroom that kept changing size, shape, and even began to defy reality with it's warpings. I opened my eyes and asked my friend if he was still human. He mumbled a response that I took as yes. I closed my eyes again and continued directing my commercials. <BR>
<BR>
I opened my eyes again. I yelled for my friend to get the bucket, but he didn't know what it was. (I found out later that I had been yelling 'barrel!!' and he didn't understand what a barrel was.) I puked all over his bed, and then began on a trip so hard that I don't even remember what it was. I came too and I had been lying in my puke. I yelled for the bucket again, and he gave it to me. I puked again and again and again, my muscles were clenched so tightly from the constant puking that I accidentally soiled myself (#2, ladies and gents). After this, I told my friend I wanted to take a shower because I was covered in puke and feces. He didn't understand why I wanted to bathe. So I told him over and over that I needed to. He continued to not understand why.<BR>
<BR>
Eventually my dad called, (we took everything at 7, it was only 9 but it seemed like days had passed) and I told him that I had puked and needed to come home. I'm not sure how I managed to talk to him. I continued to sit around and stare at my friends radio clock until I heard my dad honk. I managed to get up and grab my stuff and walk to the door. I'm suprised he didn't know I was high. I had the stiffest robo movement I've ever heard of. I got home and showered. This was a really interesting part of it all.<BR>
I was standing in the shower, and I was getting wet, but I don't remember the water ever hitting me or ever even being on. I got out of the shower and looked in the mirror. I was definitely wet and definitely clean from my excrement. I tossed my clothes in the laundry and ran back to my room, hit my matress, and passed out immediately.<BR>
<BR>
It was definitely a worthwhile experience even with the embarassments. I'd do it again, and I plan to hit the 1308mg mark next time. <BR>
<BR>
One more thing. We were listening to Infected Mushroom songs the whole time we were tripping, and at one point we both heard a 5 year old british girl in one of the songs. A few days later, my friend listened to all the songs and could never find a little girls voice in any of them. It's a tad freaky to share an experience with someone on that level.<BR>
<BR>
I'd also like to say to not use the new robatussin gel caps. They cause extreme nausea compared to the syrup.<BR>

I've been curious about herbs for the past several weeks after reading about Salvia. I ordered a bunch of different things online, including Blue or Sacred Lotus, that is, Nelumbo nucifera and NOT Blue Lily i.e. Nymphaea Caerulea, the two of which seem to get mixed up by almost every online vendor I visited.<br>
<br>
First I tried smoking Blue Lotus - I smoked about 2 grams in a water pipe and didn't feel anything that I could really distinguish from baseline. Did the same in blends with Dagga flowers and Salvia. I kept it hot and held it in for 15 to 20 seconds - nothing. So I'll wait for my extract resin to arrive and try smoking that instead to figure if I can get a buzz from Nuciferin.<br>
<br>
On another day I discovered something that I thought was remarkable. I placed a few crumbs and stems of cannabis below a small bowl full of Blue Lotus (~ 1/2 gram). The Cannabis was what a friend had left behind after rolling a joint the night before - It was the kind of thing I'd just brush into the trash. It was nothing. Maybe three small (3-4 mm) stem pieces and a few measly specks. Not even fit for a rasta mouse. I smoked the combo and felt HIGH. It was a slightly different high - I was being silly, and I experienced a heightened visual sensation and a slowing of time. There was also no paranoia. <br>
<br>
All of this is remarkable because I usually have a day's worth of pretty well established tolerance to cannabis after smoking a lot of it the night before. So it seemed to me the Lotus had some synergy with the Cannabis (given that I had smoked about as much pot as I could fit under my thumbnail), which was fortunate. Now I just need to get my hands on some more Cannabis.   <br>
<br>
That day I placed 5 grams of dried Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera - don't forget) in a small bottle together with 2 oz of 190 proof Everclear and heated it in a pot of boiling water on the stove top for five minutes. I then let the herbal extraction sit for a full 24 hours. When shaken the extract had a milky look to it. When I let it settle I could see globules of insoluble extracted material floating around in the alcohol (like oil in water, but not exactly). I took this to mean that it was a good, strong extraction. I mixed 1 oz of this with a small glass of orange juice and drank it down a few minutes before a friend came to pick me up for a poker game. I had already eaten so my stomach was full. <br>
<br>
Within 20 minutes a feeling of calm washed over me. I remember sitting in the passenger seat very loosely, and everything seemed kind of quiet, like driving around downtown at 4 AM - the surroundings are associated with activity and general 'noise', but there is an eerie calm because no-one's around. We weren't driving downtown but that's the feeling I got - no bother from external stimulus. This is despite the fact that my notoriously longwinded friend was STILL talking. That didn't bother me either. I felt good and had a strong suspicion that it was the Lotus extract (and not the Everclear as I drank it on a full stomach).<br>
<br>
The other thing I noticed was that I 'was on'. When we arrived at the poker game we meet a large group of card players (co-workers) I didn't feel as aloof as usual. I felt good about the impression I was making. In a genuine sense - I was relaxed enough to start a conversation with anyone, or cajole the entire group and managed to hold my own. I know now, this was a result of having my mood lifted, which I attribute to the Lotus.<br>
<br>
The Lotus didn't do anything for my poker game though. I would have to say that the noticeable effects of drinking the herbal extract lasted about 90 minutes. Then I concentrated on not losing so badly.<br>
<br>
Of course I could be dead wrong - maybe the reason I felt high when I smoked Blue Lotus with weed is because I smoked it with weed, and maybe the reason I felt good after drinking an Everclear extraction was because I drank Everclear. Still, I thought I'd provide my experiences here and let you judge for yourselves. Seems there wasn't much reported on Nelumbo nucifera.<!--   End Body   -->

I have been using E for about a year, at first the after effects were not at al noticable, the only thing that I can say about it was that I was always very dissapointed as soon as the peak effects had worn off, but then this is the same feeling I get when I use a number of drugs such as alcohol.<BR>
<BR>
About 6 months after I first used E me and a few freinds went on holiday to Ibiza, by this time I had used it 5 times however I do not know the dose as these were black market pills ( I think I probably had 10-12 pills between those 5 Experiences).  Whilst on holiday I used E more than I had ever used it before and since, we were there for just a week but in that time I got through about another 12-14 pills, which in heindsight was a bit stupid but it was a good week!  After coming back from holiday I did not feel any real crash, maybe a bit of dissapointment that the week was over but nothing serious.<BR>
<BR>
However recentley I have noticed that perhaps the expirience is not quite as good as I remeber, I try and put this down to the fact that the pills here, Manchester UK, are not quite as good as the notoriously strong spanish ones in Ibiza.  Also the after effects have increased each time Ive taken E since.  I can never sleep directly after using E, even after dancing like an idiot for 5-6 hours,.  The next day I just feel very blunted, like I dont really care about anything at all, but not in the a good way in a more depressive kind of way.  This feeling usually lasts two or three days, and is directly linked to how much I used in the expirience.<!--   End Body   -->

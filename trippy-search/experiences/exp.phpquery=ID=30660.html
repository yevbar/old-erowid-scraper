Alright, so 2 weeks a go my friend, C comes back from a short vacation to Switzerland, he calls me up and tells me he brought back a few souveneirs, I head over to his house, thinking he got some nice, famous swizz weed. I get there and he shows me these two little gelcaps, and I'm like 'what the hell is this?' He responds, 'It's 2Ci.' I stare at him, wondering what the hell 2Ci was. He says 'its that shit that Alex used to do.' (Alex is his Junky brother) I remember his brother talkin about it now, and say 'Oh snap that sounds awesome!' <br>
<br>
I decided not to do it that night , as I knew little about this drug. I go home, research it, and decide that I would do it. We decided to do the next weekend.<br>
<br>
So I come over C's house, he tells me everything is set up, his parents wouldnt be home 'til 2:00 A.M., and it was 8:00. There is also another friend there, J who decided it would be fun enough just watching us do it, and decided not to try it. So C and I both take 15 mgs of the stuff, and wait for it to kick in. About 45 mins later, I can feel it kinda kickiing in. I feel a slight tingly feeling, and my mind comences to philosophize (is that a word) and anylize the weirdest shit. I ask my friend, 'you feeling anything?' he replies 'I think so.' We than move from C's bedroom to the TV room, and this is where the fun starts.<br>
<br>
We decide to watch the Simpsons. about 30 minutes later I see my first visual, as I can see the tv kind of swaying, and moving torwards me. I look over to C, he seems to staring at the floor. I look to J, and he just begins to laugh, saying we looked like zombies. About an hour later, (about 2 hours and 15 minuts into the trip) I begin to feel really happy and greatful that I had such great friends. The trip is also becoming amazingly psychodelic,(sp?) and I begin to start seeing things warp in and out. Also, I kinda forget about my surrroundings and just stare off out the window. I'm not exactly sure how long I did this for, but later according to J, he tried to talk to me, but I didn't even notice. <br>
<br>
I come back to the world, and am startled to see that no one is in the room with me. I walk around looking in closets for my missing friends. I began to get worried, and my heart started beating hella fast. I walk out of the room and continue my search. After about 15 minutes of searching, I find J eating a freshly ordered pizza and C laying on the ground, staring at the ceiling. I feel totally relieved about finding my friends, and begin to start enjoying my trip. <br>
<br>
As the hours pass by, I feel really happy about everything, and I am in total Bliss. Its been about 5 hours and I can feel the shit wearing offm I still am seeing things, but I no longer am feeling these crazy feelings. I look over to C, and he seems to be falling out of it too. About an hour later, I am no longer seeing anything, and I decided that it would be best that I try to get some sleep. All three of us popp 2 ambiens, and tried to get some shut-eye. I dozed off, and had great dreams. When I woke up, I felt so great about the trip the night before, but also fealt glad to be in my normal state.<!--   End Body   -->

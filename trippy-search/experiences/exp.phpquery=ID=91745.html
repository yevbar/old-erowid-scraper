<!--   Start Body   -->


Set – Not perfect but I’ve had worse. An hours sleep the night before makes me feel sleepy<br>
<br>
Setting – My House, kids due in from school – busy household – I’m used to it<br>
<br>
T+0.00 – Drink 3mgs of dissolved drug<br>
<br>
T+ 0.10 Faint perceptual changes, continue reading my book.<br>
<br>
T+ 0.20 Give up on reading as I can’t follow the narrative, watch my dogs play fighting, grab a quilt & lie underneath it on the settee, start to feel warm yet shivery, this is a fairly standard physical effect I get from a 2Cxx.<br>
<br>
T+0.50 Feels warm & relaxed, introspective – then again I’m alone with two dogs for company so intellectual discourse is out of the question.<br>
<br>
T+ 0.55 My wife rings to see if I’m dead or ill from ingesting the drug. I toy with the idea of not answering the phone – however I do my duty and confirm that I’m alive.<br>
<br>
T+01.10 I make a ham, mayo & pease pudding sandwich then eat it – delicious – so much so I make another. I have a noticeable tingling up my spine & the nape of my neck. This is feeling quite luxurious now. No visual effect to speak of it just feels good. I consider redosing; I consider for about 5 seconds then decide.<br>
<br>
T+01.25 - Take another dose of 3.5 mgs in orange juice.<br>
<br>
T+ 01.50 – My kids come in from school – I orient my mind & begin giving standard instructions such as “uniform in the wash” – “take the dogs out” – “put your bait box in the sink for washing” – “do any homework you have”. My vision is becoming noticeably blurred as the second dose kicks in. Brief CEVs of women – very realistic - like flash frames.<br>
<br>
I’m still perfectly able to carry on conversations so long as I feign tiredness when a I feel there’s a slight lag in mental processing before I respond.<br>
<br>
I find myself in a dreamlike state & retire upstairs to have a bath – the timekeeping breaks down from this point as I got into what I was doing which was more interesting than writing stuff down..<br>
<br>
There’s a definite aphrodisiac quality to the drug – not in the same league as 2CE but definitely present. I coax my wife upstairs & we spend a while in bed. Orgasms achieved x2 – who knows if there wasn’t other activities going on (kids in & out of the house dogs barking etc) how that might play out.<br>
<br>
My wife tells me there is marked pupil dilation.<br>
<br>
At one point I get a feeling of anxiety – it lasts seconds & is dispelled by a unique sense of wellbeing that seems to emanate from the ether – like a superpowers pick me up.<br>
<br>
I begin to drift, my mind wanders, there are inferences of mind movie type visuals which don’t quite materialise, hopefully some of you will understand this interim state.<br>
<br>
I find myself a little more clumsy than usual, dropping a couple of things getting entangled in my clothes as I get dressed to go out.<br>
<br>
We set off into the foggy night – my wife driving – myself sitting with my eyes closed – just concentrating on feeling calm – which works rather well.<br>
<br>
I think I’ve probably overshot the mark for going out maybe 4mgs would have been better suited as my concentration on external things is difficult to maintain.<br>
Anyway we watch the band.<br>
<br>
T+ 7.45 I suddenly come to life the internalising seems to vanish quite quickly & I find I’m up dancing & having a great time & the show ends too soon for my liking.<br>
I find I’m fired up in a low key way (I have a tendency to get very fired up & overly positive at times) & I talk most of the way home & chat with three of my kids when we get in, I find myself play fighting with my youngest son.<br>
<br>
T+8.45 Eat donner kebabs – they taste foul but so moreish – I imagine that cannibalism has a similar effect – you take a bite & think “yeuch” yet are compelled by some strange force ( AKA greed) to eat more.<br>
<br>
T+ 9.45 – The children are despatched to bed, my older son leaves & goes to his house & we eat a couple of diazepam, some codeine & smoke some dope – which puts my on my back in short order.<br>
<br>
T+ God knows when – I fell asleep<br>
<br>
Overall a very positive feeling from the drug, at some points I felt lovely/ laid back blissful, there was some mild confusion at times, though this could have been due to sleepiness & the fact I tend to get confused anyway. I enjoyed it. I shall sample it again in a single higher dose next time and hopefully in a better mindset.<!--   End Body   -->

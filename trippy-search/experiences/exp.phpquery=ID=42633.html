This is an attempt to recount the details of my first experience using psychadelics. I realize the above-stated doses are extreme, but they are accurate. I took these quantities out of ignorance having no prior experience or knowledge of appropriate first time methods. I had this trip 7 months ago and am still recovering.<BR>
<BR>
My mental state going into this was one of 'lets do it man, lets  see what life's all about,' but below the surface I've always had a good deal of anxiety and depression. I took the drugs at an outdoor concert venue in Washington state. First the mushrooms (all) and then the acid within 10 minutes. I was with two friends that I did not know well and did not completely trust. Initially, I felt small changes in sensory perception, beginning with color changes and auditory variations in volume. I made my way to the top of a hill where I could hear the music, and look out over the Columbia river gorge. Shortly after sitting down I heard my friend mention something and I turned my head to talk back. This is when the drugs hit me. When I turned my head, everything smeared visually. I shook my head, but doing this just made the smears start bouncing around and morphing into one another.<BR>
<BR>
Having no prior experience with psychadelics, this was insane and I began to have intense pulsations of fear. I started reaching out with my arms for someone nearby, but my arms would disappear into these smeared geometric patterns and come back to wrap around my face. I tried yelling, but I couldn't understand the words coming from my mouth. Then the panic hit me really hard. My heart was pounding, I was sweating heavily, and I suddenly couldn't feel myself breathing. I then lost all subsequent feeling in my hands, feet, and facial organs. At this point I was roughly 2 hours in. Things got so distorted that I couldn't tell which one of my senses was picking up what. The things I was seeing are unexplainable. Just radical morphing images in my periphery whether I had my eyes open or closed it didn't matter. The things I focused on would lapse into the periphery. I began to have the experience of living distorted memories again, and I was seeing and touching faces, shapes, and forces that were not there (technically). It grew from this into my being just morphing with the sky and the earth. I felt like I was physically coming apart and transforming into different parts of the universe. I felt strongly that I was sitting in front of my body, and my motions were independent of it.<BR>
<BR>
At roughly 4 hours the fear rose to a new level for me. It was a new kind of fear that I've never felt before. I was just completely paralyzed and I knew that I was approaching death. I had wave after wave of panic attacks, but there were also new emotions that I've never before encountered. At this point I couldn't take the fear and the horror I was going through, so I began trying to crawl toward a cliff I had seen earlier in an effort to throw myself off. Fortunately my motor skills were so impaired I was physically unable to move. I remember at that point just crying and giving up control. I just said 'its over let it take you' and in doing so some of the fear left me and I just laid there thinking about my family and friends and trying to connect with them on some level to send them my love. <BR>
<BR>
About 6-7 hours in, my friends had managed to get me to an ambulance crew. There is only one thing I remember during the following 4 hours or so and that was asking the Medic what time it was. He replied '6:30' after awhile I asked him again and he said '6:15.'   I couldn't fully comprehend this, but I can say that over the course of the trip (lasted about 18 hours) I thought years had gone bye. <BR>
<BR>
I honestly cannot recall anything from about the 7th to 15th hours of the trip. I have snapshot-like memories of some very unexplainable things. Coming down was very sad. I was just overwhelmed with empathy for every living thing. I felt extremely detached from everyone around me, and my view of reality and the world was very distorted.<BR>
<BR>
For months after this trip I had severe panic attacks/flashbacks and depression, along with a major change in reality perception. For the first several weeks after I felt like I was drifting on the line of psychosis. I am not the same person I was before this experience. Although I have healed spiritually, I have a hard time relating to anyone who has not had similar experiences and I continue to feel like this reality is a cage that I have to escape from. A note to all: don't take doses like this, I found it very hard to reintegrate myself into reality after doing so. Drugs are not necessesary to reach answers for the ultimate questions in life.<!--   End Body   -->

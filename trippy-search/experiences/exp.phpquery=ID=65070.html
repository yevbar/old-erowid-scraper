::Substances-Doses::<br>
mescaline/peruvian torch - 240ml liquid extract<br>
hawaiian babywoodrose/lsa - 20 seeds<br>
morning glory/lsa - 20 seeds<br>
acoru calamus - 2g extract<br>
kava kava - unknown dose<br>
gingseng - unknown dose<br>
psilocybin/mushrooms - 2g<br>
<br>
<br>
**11:40PM**<br>
I waited until it was late so that most people within my neighborhood would be asleep, and not effect the tranquility I require in my meditations. I began by consuming the liquid extract of Peruvian Torch since (for me) it takes longer to become active then the other substances, which I planned to take within 15-20 minutes hoping all the substances would become active together. The Peruvian Torch had a soapy/oily feel in my mouth but otherwise the taste was very bearable, though, the more I drank I seemed to get a full feeling in my stomach as if I had eaten 10 steaks and needed to purge them despite the normal taste.<br>
<br>
**12AM**<br>
Following the ingestion of the Peruvian Torch I began mixing the ground Morning Glory & Woodrose seeds with the Kava/Gingseng/Calamus powder extract into multiple capsules, then proceeded to ingest them. After I had finished swallowing the capsules, I ingested the 2 grams of mushrooms. At this point I was surprised by how extremely tired I had become. I decided to enjoy some television instead of the continual hours of meditation I normally preceed upon when I ingest psychoactives. I would have fallen asleep in the lotus position as I've done many times :)<br>
<br>
**1:20AM**<br>
The substances had to my surprise began to take effect quickly, normally mescaline would take 2-3 hours to kick in. This also being the first time I've mixed these exact substances together, I was surprised to notice how calming the mescaline experience was in comparison to the speediness and fast visual tracers normally experienced. This was probably from the calamus/gingseng/kava I had added. At this point the visuals were in fact very similar to 300-400mcg of LSD in that the visuals had a slow peaceful flow to them over the fast overwhelming experiences of just mescaline alone.<br>
<br>
**2AM**<br>
After watching tv and finding nothing interesting I decided to lay on my back and enjoy the show my mind was putting on for me, still amazed by how the Mescaline seemed completely masked by the LSA & Psilocybin. So much so that if I wasn't the one who prepared the mixture I would not think Mescaline was active within me at all, I layed and watched my curtains wave about as if a breeze was flowing through them yet the window was closed.<br>
<br>
**2:30AM**<br>
Having to urinate, I left my room and upon entering the bathroom I noticed the toilet flusher/handle was going up and down as if it was flushing itself. I chuckled and noticed my vision had faded slightly as if i was wearing sunglasses, I began to wabble as I walked back to my room. Having heavily used these substances individually and some minor mixes, I knew this was the LSA/Acoru/KAVA reaching their full strength. The rest of the nite continued like this, very peaceful, nothing like I expected to experience especially with the Mescaline I had included.<br>
<br>
**10AM**<br>
When I had awakened there was a pleasant after glow, a sense of clarity without intoxication, increased energy and will to complete tasks as well without the caffeine feeling that comes with an afterglow.<br>
<br>
**Summary**<br>
It seemed like a risky mix but, all in all this mixture was very pleasant and calming, no overwhelming feelings or negative thoughts, great come down and afterglow.<br>
<br>
*Quick Backround*<br>
This information is strictly in reference to my psyche so that one may have a closer understanding of my perspective through this experience. I'm a cancer survivor who found spirituality through use of hallucinogens, I've partaken in many ritual substances including, Ayahausca, LSD, Psilocybin, LSA, Mescaline, Amanitas Muscaria, Salvia Divinorum, Ketamine, Salu Henbane, and quite literly 30-40 other substances from around the world. Iv used these substances in meditative states lasting at times Days, all together I would say I have had around 500 individual hallucinogenic experiences.<!--   End Body   -->

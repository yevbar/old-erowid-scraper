Since my friends and I had previously exhausted my city of all its Morning Glory seeds, I wanted to try a different legal drug.  Having read up on Nutmeg some months before, I made the decision to eat some spice.<br>
	<br>
I am not an experience drug user by any means.  In fact, the only drugs I have tried are Marijuana and Morning Glory seeds.  I have never experienced any convincing hallucinations, and that was what I was looking for in Nutmeg.  As of today, Nutmeg is definitely the strongest drug I have taken.<br>
<br>
(T-1:00) – I ran out to the local grocery store and bought a jar of 12 nuts.  Net weight is 63 grams.  <br>
<br>
(T-0:15) – From the research I did the night before, I decided to eat the 2 largest nuts in the jar.  Should be somewhere between 11-15 grams.<br>
<br>
(T=0:00) – After grinding up only two nuts, I was amazed at how much spice I had to eat.  Since I knew it would be impossible to eat the Nutmeg straight, I fetched some ice cream and some water.  By plugging my nose and using the ice cream to mask the Nutmeg’s texture, I got it all down without any difficulties.  Now I wait.<br>
<br>
(T+1:00) – I went to my friend’s house where I met “K” and “L”.  K was hesitant about trying any Nutmeg because most experience reports said that Nutmeg was not worth it.  L had no knowledge about Nutmeg.  They both ended up grinding up 2 nuts and then mixed the shavings with tapioca.  I told them that plugging their noses would mask the taste, but it didn’t help.  They both gave up after ingesting no more than 2 grams of Nutmeg each.<br>
<br>
(T+1:30) – K and L decided to smoke some pot.  I decided against smoking because I wanted to feel the Nutmeg’s effects alone.  If I’m experimenting with a new drug, I don’t want to take two drugs and mix up the effects.<br>
<br>
(T+2:30) – Nothing more than a contact high.<br>
<br>
(T+4:30) – I think I’m feeling something.  Could be placebo. My other friend “J” arrives.  <br>
<br>
(T+5:00) – I’m feeling stoned now.  I have cottonmouth.  I was so used to only getting cottonmouth after smoking, that I thought I had smoked.  After remembering that I didn’t smoke at all, I realized it must be the Nutmeg giving me cottonmouth.  This was reassuring because I now knew it wasn’t a placebo high.<br>
<br>
(T+6:00) – Definitely off baseline.  I’m feeling very stoned.  I can make myself see minor hallucinations in the wall or carpet.  My memory is shot.  It’s very similar to a Marijuana high.  No nausea.  At this point I’m pretty comfortable with myself. <br>
<br>
(T+7:00) – Feeling sedated.  I felt like I was on a tranquilizer.  I just wanted to sit down and stare off into space.  I have never been drunk before, but I gather this is what its like.<br>
<br>
(T+7:45) – K, L, and J wanted to smoke some more pot.  At this point, I feel really drunk and sluggish.  I tried to take a few hits of the blunt they were smoking but it was unusually difficult.  I couldn’t distinguish the effects of the Cannabis and the effects of the Nutmeg.  I felt the need to separate from my friends and take a walk.  I ended up in my car and waited until my friends were done smoking to reunite with them.<br>
<br>
(T+11:30) – It’s hard to remember what I did after we smoked.  I never felt particularly uncomfortable.  I never felt really good, either. <br>
<br>
(T+14:00) – Went to bed.  Still intoxicated.<br>
<br>
(T+20:00) – I had to wake up to go to the dentist.  I was amazed at how high I still was.  Sitting down and watching my brother play video games was very enjoyable.<br>
<br>
(T+26:00) – I forget what I did after my dentist appointment.  Nutmeg kills my memory more than pot does.  I was beginning to come down.  I went to my friend, “P”s, house.  He commented that I looked “drowsy as hell”.  He didn’t know that I had previously done Nutmeg.<br>
<br>
(T+28:00) – I feel normal again.<br>
<br>
Nutmeg was too long lasting for my taste.  It was also too sedating.<br>
<br>
I now understand why it’s still legal.  I don’t see how anybody could abuse this drug.  I might try it again.  It really takes a lot out of me.  Luckily, I never felt nausea of any kind.  It’s a pleasant, sedated high with minor hallucinations.  The whole experience seemed mildly similar to Marijuana.  Be sure to be patient and not take too much.  It took me seven hours to peak.<!--   End Body   -->

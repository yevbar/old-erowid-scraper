Substances: DPT, Cannabis, Acetaminophen, Caffeine, Naproxen Sodium<BR>
<BR>
Dose: 	DPT – unknown, 3 lines approx. 2mm x 2mm x 3cm<BR>
	Cannabis – multiple bowls<BR>
	Acetaminophen – 500 mg<BR>
	Caffeine – 55 mg<BR>
	Naproxen Sodium – 220mg<BR>
<BR>
Set: This is my first trip since Christmas Day 2005. We just got back from an overnight backpacking trip in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. I had planned to take my dose up there, but since there were very few trailheads open it was crowded up there. The weather was also less than ideal, it snowed on us on the way in. It was excellent exercise for me however and a nice holiday. I thoroughly enjoyed our camping trip. I was understandably tired and a little sore and I worked on this beforehand with a nice bath. I am anxious as I always am before taking a psychedelic, but there's the 'new drug' and eyeballing anxieties as well. I'm glad to have my wife for a sober sitter. No depression lately.<BR>
<BR>
Setting: My new home, our apartment, alone with my wife. The clutter has been picked up for the most part. This is my first trip here, my first time using this substance and my first time insufflating. I'm a little anxious about going too far out and raising awareness of the neighbors. My highest rated instrumental classical, jazz and Ravi Shankar tracks have been randomized and are playing. I haven't eaten since 11:00 (t-10h), when I had some oatmeal with raisins before our hike out.  I am vegan and generally take multi-vitamins and 1500mg of Valproic Acid a day as a mood stabilizer. I have not taken my Valproic Acid today as previous experiences have led me to believe it may inhibit the trip to some extent.<BR>
<BR>
Report: [T-0:05] 'Universal Lover' by Fantuzzi plays. It is the only piece with vocals in this mix. It takes me a few minutes to work up to it. My wife offers to dose with me, but I won't have it since this compound is still unknown to me. I prepared the dose by using a non-serrated steak knife to retrieve some of the powder from the bag and cut it up (there were a few clumps, but it was already fairly powdery). I then used the knife to make two fairly equal lines. I had already prepared a straw by cutting off a 3 inch section to use. <BR>
<BR>
[T+0:00] After singing along with the song, hugging my wife, much mental preparation and many breaths I placed the straw in my right nostril and slowly and steadily inhaled along the length of one 2mm x 2mm x 2.5cm line. At first it didn't burn as bad as I expected. The nasal drip was about what was expected just knowing how these compounds taste. Later on the burn became more pronounced. <BR>
<BR>
[T+0:05] I have my first alerts, body feels mostly. Nasal burn increases. I am looking at Dali books but decide he is too grotesque right now and get “One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish” by Dr. Seuss instead and read it to my wife.<BR>
<BR>
[T+0:10] I’m getting stronger alerts now. A bit of feeling like I had to go and minor nausea, similar to how Foxy can make me feel. Nausea is not bad enough to make me seek solace in Cannabis. Nasal burn is more pronounced now and levels off. Reading has become more difficult. My hair bands are uncomfortable and are removed.<BR>
<BR>
[T+0:20] It feels like I'm going to stay at this level, but I decide to wait 10 more minutes anyway. There is minor patterning on the ceiling with some movement. My headspace is remarkably straight but I am off baseline. I’d say  I’m at a + on the Shulgin Scale right now.  My nose feels 'funny'.<BR>
<BR>
[T+0:30] I prepare one more line and snort double my previous effort. It all goes up the same nostril because the other one was plugged. I don’t find this very difficult to manage.<BR>
<BR>
[T+0:40] There are added effects now, first strong alerts of the second dose. I take one small hit off the bong.<BR>
<BR>
[T+0:45] My trip is definitely coming on now. The visuals are growing stronger and my mindspace is getting much trippier. I’d say a strong ++ at this point. I notice some of the compound stuck towards the bottom of my nose and a few milligrams fall out. Next time I will place the straw a little further into my nose.<BR>
<BR>
[T+0:50] I ask my wife to leave the bedroom. I’m wondering how much I took and how far out it will take me.  I feel it still getting up to full speed. The ceiling seems strongly geometric (lots of pyramids) and seems to be perforated in spots, with a swirling multi-colored display in the background. I didn't make it over to the other side of the perforation on this trip, that is left for future explorations with this drug.<BR>
<BR>
[T+~1:00] Full on Being. Feels like I’m at the shallow end of the +++ pool now. The visuals at this point are definitely stronger than any other substance I've ingested, but not the overwhelming blanket of visuals or “psychedelic mess” some other users have reported. It should be noted however that I rarely get too much in the way of visuals. Music is magical and it’s easy to get “lost” in the sound. I feel like I’m floating on a sensual sea. <BR>
<BR>
The effects continue to unfold. It is a 'soft landing' this time, which was what I wanted given our living situation. That continual waking up to myself, finding myself put into a body again. Never do I feel like I took 'too much' or a heroic dose. This is what I would call a strong recreational dose, no ego death just a nice “Christ awareness”. I invite my wife back to our bedroom. <BR>
<BR>
I mostly just lie down and enjoy the feelings. I worry that my wife is worried. I ask her if I look like I’m in trouble. She tells me no. I tell her “I do from this end,” referring to the deluge of sensory input and waking up feeling but I meant it in a playful way :). This joke is repeated several times this night. I complain about temperature disturbances, like the mushrooms produce in me. My wife's face is a wide plane of beautiful patterns and seems very large but totally proportional. I’m getting lost starring at it. She looks simply gorgeous and radiant. It’s going to take a few minutes to get used to my body. Take 500mg of acetaminophen for my headache which is rather strong and through out my head, it does not allay it.<BR>
<BR>
[T+~2:00] We've moved out to the living room. My wife starts to suck my cock. It feels incredible, lasts a nice long while and has a fitting, incredible climax. The experience was very moving and I felt the love pouring out from my wife. It was very stimulating mentally and physically. The music is still blowing me away. I smoke some more Cannabis.<BR>
<BR>
[T+3:00] It’s starting to wane by now. I eat some enchiladas. My feelings are guiding my thoughts. I think about grace and self-respect and need. I feel thankful for this food after my fast and think about how everything emanates from the Divine. I feel disgust with myself for wanting to scrape the container clean of sauce and think about how what I put in my body affects it. I feel hungry still and think about all those who want for food everyday and thought about what they would do if they had this before them. Then I feel like a hungry child and scraped it clean with vigor, thankful for every drop. <BR>
<BR>
I think about the dance between life and death in this creation and the yin-yang symbol. Fairly strong visuals persist when staring at objects. Looking at my wife’s monitor with the default Windows background I see lots of patterns in the clouds, including many faces. I think about reptiles, amphibians and especially insects, as to me the empty enchilada container looks like a large cockroach. Some Bach organ music plays and seems to be speaking for them, sort of an anthem proclaiming their intelligence and desire for relations. On the “cockroache’s” wings I see some stylized marching insects and a turtle. As is usually the case when I see anything resembling an entity while tripping I feel very ambivalent, unsure of whether I can trust the “entity”. After the song is over I watch some Futurama, ready to relax a bit.<BR>
<BR>
[T+4:00] The DPT has a tail end push like Foxy, I could be up for at least 4 more hours easily. I start writing this trip report.<BR>
<BR>
[T+4:35] Patterning is still visible on the ceiling. More pronounced than it was at T+0:20 but less than at T+0:50.<BR>
<BR>
[T+5:00] I’m quite tired but still feeling the push. I’m pretty much down except for the push.<BR>
<BR>
[T+8:00] I’m going to attempt sleep after much Cannabis and TV. It takes a normal amount of time to fall asleep.<BR>
<BR>
[T+16:00] I wake up on my own with no alarm clock. I have a bit of a hangover, mostly a moderate headache which is diffuse but centered on the back of my head.<BR>
<BR>
[T+19:00] I take a nap for about an hour.<BR>
<BR>
[T+20:00] A Mountain Dew helps my headache some.<BR>
<BR>
[T+26:00] My headache persists, so I take 220mg naproxen sodium.<BR>
<BR>
[T+27:00] The headache is very manageable now, barely noticeable.<BR>
<BR>
Summary: As is usually the case, I got the trip I needed this time. It was my hand-out. I am very thankful to the One for everything I have and am thankful for these crumbs of grace from this trip. Everything in creation is a handout from the One. I did not go to see Hir today, I merely came humbly up to Hir door and gifts rained down upon me. I did not venture over to the other side of the veil, instead I had my “Christ experience” and that hunger was fed. In future experiences I will seek out that other side, but the substance I’ve tried that this most reminds me of is 5-MeO-DMT and it feels like it has the same depth. <BR>
<BR>
Given the time scales with this drug one could be stuck in a difficult spot for some time (granted not as long as with some other substances). Preparation is definitely key for ventures further out, with absolute privacy a must for me. These waters look to run very deep. My trip was not hard to land at all. It was very routine, very much like an equivalent strength 5-MeO-DMT landing but not as hurried. My nose felt funny all night, insufflation is not my favorite way to take drugs. High doses very well may be terrifying, we shall see, but lower doses definitely have a recreational use on par with 5-MeO-DMT and use possibly on par entheogenically. <BR>
<BR>
If it weren’t for the associated headache I’d probably prefer it to 5-MeO-DMT recreationally given their similarity, mostly due to the time profile, but also due to the enhanced visuals and special auditory processing. However the headache makes me disinclined to experiment with this substance too often.<!--   End Body   -->

After hearing about salvia through a magazine article, I began to research the drug and its claims.  After some research I procured some online and received it via FedEx Letter later that week.  It was Jan 2000 and some friends and I took some hits after hitting the bars and while waiting for some mescaline/MDMA conglomeration (strongly discourage this mix) to hit us.  We were sans pot and were smoking the salvia in the wrong mindset. Though I had read several experiences, I was smoking a lot of pot back then and couldn't prepare my mind for a salvia trip.  Also, I didn't hold the smoke in for the recommended length.  After some mis-smoking of the plant, we chalked it up to being nothing more than a sales gimmick and I put the bag away.  Forgotten.  <BR>
<BR>
Move forward almost one year:  December 2000.  I am preparing for mushrooms; reading as much as I can about the effects.  As I came to the Erowid site I see the Salvia category and thought, 'Might this substance be true?'  I read up as much as I could and decided to trip without a sitter.  I had to be in the perfect mindset and figured I could handle it.<BR>
<BR>
I turned off all the lights and put my Geiss music screensaver on to some bagpipes.  I took 2 bong hits and held them for what seemed like a minute.  I lay down in my bed and began to feel a little unbalanced.  I started getting visuals, but not visions.  These visuals were more space and dimension oriented.  Everything in my room seemed to have a two-dimension quality but very much so floating in a three-dimensional room.  Intrigued, and not sure on the strength of my year-old salvia leaves, I decided to smoke one more hit.  After exhaling, I went to sit back against the wall behind me but couldn't find it.  My bedroom seemed to be completely tilted--as if I were standing on the corner of the floor.  If I moved forward I would surely fall into the abyss. I fell backwards and crashed into the wall.  I felt relieved that the wall was there. I got up to walk around and noticed that my whole apartment was the same, but two-dimensional and very distanced from me.  My mind knew that this was the effects of the plant, so I kept waiting for it to fade away (that was the one drawback--I guess I'm too grounded to get lost in enlightenment). <BR>
<BR>
After about ten minutes I lay down on the couch and closed my eyes.  I still had this two-dimensional feeling as if I had just been shown things how they could exist in other's eyes.  A little later, the feeling wore off and I was amazed that I finally was able to see the world differently then before.  <BR>
<BR>
For me it seemed to open up my mind to realize that there are other ways to view the world and other ways to be a part of it.  If we are truly from the earth, and to the earth we will return, it is a gift that we can experience that which MotherEarth has to offer us.  I went from sceptic to believer.  Just wish it wouldn't have taken a year to realize it.<!--   End Body   -->

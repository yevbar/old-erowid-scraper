This is definitely the first time I have ever injected drugs.  I intended to go to sleep around 2:30 am after hanging around with my cousin and studying a bunch before that, but couldn't really sleep, so I popped 4 of his 0.5mg clonazepam pills thinking that would konk me out.  I don't have a toerance to benzodiazepines, so normally that would put me right to sleep, however, it didn't for some reason.  I am ADD, so I have a prescription for methylphenidate, and I took roughly my standard dose of 30mg about 12 hours before, so that should have completely worn off.<br>
<br>
About 1.5 hours later I decided that I was in the mood for experimentation, so I grabbed the roughly 2ml that were remaining in a couple of my cousin's roxicet (liquid percocet) bottles.  Then I decided for some reason that I wanted to finally try injecting some drugs, although I am very aware of the dangers involved.<br>
<br>
I crushed the equivalent of 40mg of methylphenidate into a fine powder, along with a single 5/325 percocet pill.  I tried to cook it up, but found that that acetaminophen in the percocet didn't dissolve very well.  I didn't want to inject such a viscous substance, but yet didn't want to waste it either, so I drank it (it tasted awful).<br>
<br>
Next I crushed up 40mg more of the methylphenidate and cooked that up.  I used a packaged, standard tuberculosis 25 guage 1 inch 1ml hypodermic needle, which I procured from my cousin, who takes Immitrex IM.  I made sure that I used a cotton swab as a filter when I was drawing the ritalin solution into the syringe, to try to avoid injecting insolubles.  I also alcohol swabbed my arm and used a home-made tourniquet to find veins.  Since I haven't done this before, it wasn't hard to find veins in my arm.  I made sure I had hit a blood vessel and proceeded to inject the solution.<br>
<br>
I found that the effects didn't hit me quite as fast as a expected they would.  It took almost a minute for the effects to set in, but the best I can describe it is a powerful euphoria accompanied by a moderately stimulated, very relaxing feeling.  I thought, 'This is awesome'.  It was completely different from say snorting way too much speed, where you feel too jacked up.  It was euphoric and stimulating, but yet relaxing.<br>
So I decided to snort another 40 mg of methylphenidate about 5 minutes after that, although my plans changed mid way though and I ended up injecting that too.  Right now I feel fantastic.  It's been about 20 minutes since my second injection and this is utterly amazing.  Now I know why people inject drugs.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I know that even with all the precautions I took as far as safety, what I did was in fact extremely dangerous.  Injecting pills can clog blood vessels, as well as greatly increase the risk of some horrible infections, and injecting ritalin especially can induce permanent lung damage (still not sure why that is).  Also it's generally not smart to speedball, even on a low level, by mixing an opiate with an amphetamine or amphetamine-like compund, or cocaine.<br>
<br>
It's now about an hour since my last dose and this is definitely the most enjoyable drug experience since when I took 1 5/325 percocet pill with some premium kratom.    I would have to say this is more fun though.  I'm not too fucked up to do anything, in fact, I could get a lot done right now if I wanted.<!--   End Body   -->

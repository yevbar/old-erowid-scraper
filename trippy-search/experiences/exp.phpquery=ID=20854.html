While traveling in seattle I found a book shop, and in the back of the book shop I found an interesting book on ritualistic herbs published in the late 70's.  I read it cover to cover and was interested most in the morning glory.  I had heard it had effects, but never knew the dosage. It was a blue moon, and summer, and how could I not take a chance to try it? Despite protests from some of my friends I decided to whip up a batch according to a recipe in the book.  I found my seeds at a local flower shop.  They did not say they were sprayed, but after some reading, they may have been.  When I arrived at the store there was a wide variety.  I stood there a long time wonding what kind was a good idea, and chose a package of the blue variety.  <BR>
<BR>
First I ground my seeds into a fine powder. I began doing this by hand, and after me and my roommate's hands cramped up we went and borrowed our unknowing neighbors coffee grinder, which worked wonders.  Then I soaked it in water over night.  I filtered out the sludge and put that in a ginger milkshake.  The milkshake was to help get it into my body faster.  At this point I had been fasting for about 12 hours, so it worked.  The ginger was to help stop the nausea, which it didn't, but that comes later.  <BR>
<BR>
It began slowly about an hour later.  Did I mention that this was my first experience with drugs other then weed?  Well, the onset was slow, and I was unsure that it was real, so I decided to go to an independent college play.  I would highly discourage others from attempting to watch independent theatre while on morning glories.  In the hot black box theatre I tried to follow the story line (my roommate later told me that she couldn't follow it sober, so I was ok) and mosty have memories of blurs of red and blue and gold.  When it began to run over 2 hours I gave my roommate a pleading look and we left.  I had been feeling very nauseated this whole time and was very foggy, which was frustrating, since I was hoping for something more spiritual.  <BR>
<BR>
I arrived home and was feeling very introspective, and was enjoying the mild visuals that a poster of a lush waterfall was providing.  I also noticed that the trees were gently swaying and reaching out towards me.  Then I was thinking and I wanted to watch some people.  I asked my roommate to invite over another friend of ours who normally talks like tomorrow he will have his mouth sewn shut.  He is smart, and funny, and someone I thought I could watch talk for a long time.  Unfortunatly he brought another person, whom I am not comfortable with.  I am convinced to this day (as he knew I was tripping) that he was attempting to drive me insane.  I have no proof however, so we shall move on. <BR>
<BR>
Next my trip got darker, and much more unpleasant.  The nausea had gone away, or I had forgotten it.  Another person came over, and the lights went out, and there was a movie infront of us.  It was a war movie.  It was jungle and flashbacks and scary sad story line.  It was not good for me.  I decided that to retreat to my room would be a good idea.  I had cleaned it and my altar before proceeding with the drink, and I was hoping it would be peaceful.  I was also very tired.  However, no sleep came.  There was a bending of the walls and ceiling and fevered attemps at shutting my eyes and telling my body to calm itself and sleep.  Eventually I woke up the next day, but this was the worst part.  <BR>
<BR>
I was hungover in a bad way.  Everything was loud, and bright, and I had to attend classes.  The effects grew steadily less over the next two days, but I remeber repeating to myself over and over agian, 'why did no one ever mention a hangover after this drug?'  <BR>
<BR>
This was my first experience with morning glories, and with any hallucinogen.  I am thinking of trying it again, especially after finding  a more reliable prep method then my 70's text.  All and all, it was at least an intriguing first look, and I am determined to try again and again on various things until I get the journey my soul is seeking.<!--   End Body   -->

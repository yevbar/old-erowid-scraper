My first dose was early in the day, I'd say it was about 1pm. I used 3.52g of Syrian Rue seed that I had crushed up with a mortar and pestle into a powder. I made a tea with this, and drank all of it. This stuff is NASTY. The effects came in about 1.5 hours. They were really subtle and I really enjoyed them. They lasted about 2 hours and did not impair my ability to do any normal tasks. Walking was more interesting and fun. I went to the dining courts on campus with some friends and my RA, haha. I found myself very interested in the spinach I was eating for some reason. I remember that I went to eat at 5pm. I hadn't eaten since 3am the same day. I had a glass of milk, the whites from two eggs, and a plate of spinach. I'm pretty sure all of this is okay to eat when taking MAOI's. I decided that I really liked the effects, so when I got home I started making another brew.<br>
<br>
This is where I made my mistake. I used 10.65g of the Syrian Rue this time when making my tea. I let it heat for over an hour this time; where previously I had only let it brew for about 10 min. I drained the mix through a few coffee filters. I decided that if I ate the seeds it would make for a more... intense experience. BOY was I right! NEVER eat the seeds. I am not sure exactly how much of the seeds I ate. If I had to guess I'd say about half of what I used to make the tea ended up in my stomach. I then forced down the tea over the next 30 min (right now just thinking about the tea is making me nauseous). By the time I had finished the tea the effects were kicking in. I noticed very mild tracers. I was laying down on a futon next to a friend. There were probably 6 people in my room. I remember wishing that they would be quiet so I could enjoy myself. The effects intensified. I yawned, and my jaw popped. I remember this sound echoing over and over and kind of manifesting into a beat for about 30 seconds before it faded away. I remember that one of my friends kept moving around a lot, and every time he would make a movement, it would replay in my head. <br>
<br>
At one point I  grabbed the back of my head and covered my ears with my forearms to block out the noise from my room, and when I did I heard my blood pumping through my arms. I interpreted this as the sound of helicopter blades. The sound was really deep and pleasant, so I held my arms in this position for about 10 min. I was very calm, relaxed, and happy. If I closed my eyes I felt the whole room spinning around me.<br>
<br>
It was around this time I realized that I really had to pee. I sat up, and was instantly completely disoriented. My friends did not know what I had taken, and did not believe me when I told them that I didn't think I could make it to the bathroom on my own. I lied back down thinking about my situation. I had been trying to decide whether or not I was going to throw up for the last 15 min. I sat up again, and  prepared myself to attempt to go to the bathroom (I live in a dorm and had to use the public restroom). I started walking, and was wobbling back and forth through my friends towards the door. Luckily my room is right next to the bathroom. I managed to make it into the bathroom (I probably missed the door handle 4 times before I could open it). At this point the tracers were very intense. My senses seemed to be overloaded very easily, so I tried to keep my eyes closed as much as possible. <br>
<br>
I got to the urinal and as I was finishing up I realized that vomit was imminent. I rushed to the stall and got to the toilet right in time. I threw up instantly. At this point it is safe to say that I knew I had done something wrong. The tracers were now so bad that I would only open my eyes for seconds at a time in order to get a general idea of where things were or where I was or if the stall door was locked. I couldn't decide if I should keep the stall door locked or not. I didn't want people to have a hard time opening the door if I passed out, and I didn't particularly want people seeing me in the state that I was in. Luckily my friends came in to check on me pretty often (about every 15 min) but to me it felt like they were taking hours between each visit. I went back and forth between on my knees vomiting, having diarrhea, and laying on the floor of the bathroom. All I wanted was for this to stop, but I read extensively about other people's experiences, and I knew that my ordeal was far from over. Eventually my RA got wind of my shenanigans and came in to the bathroom. Surprisingly, for the state that I was in I was completely coherent of my surroundings and able to articulate myself fully (except of course when I was vomiting). My RA decided to call the ambulance against my wishes. <br>
<br>
When the “paramedics” got there around 11pm I had managed to pull my pants up. I told them that I had taken a MAOI and that I was just vomiting because I had eaten the seeds. They had no idea what 'MAOI's' were. Well, I ended up in the hospital until about 2am. They gave me an IV because I was dehydrated from vomiting and made me take some nausea pills. I just waited for the effects to fade and they let me go. <br>
<br>
On the way home I vomited again, something that I was used to by now. Walking to my room I realized that I still had pretty intense tracers. However, I was able to walk by myself (something that I was very grateful for)! I laid down, and enjoyed the tracers waving my hand back and forth. I slept pretty well. I woke up this morning (I'm writing this report the day after) and I felt well rested. Almost all of the effects are gone now (It's 10:43pm). Everything still seems a little surreal, as I imagine it will for the next few days.<br>
<br>
Overall, the experience was worth having; even though it was horrible. I now respect my health much more, and I respect the power that some of these plants have. As of now, I do not want to ever try Syrian Rue again. I may just stick to light drinking once and a while. I don't really feel like I need to search for a crazy high anymore because my experience was pretty horrifying.<br>
<br>
If you are thinking about taking this, please consider what happened to me. Don't eat the seeds whatever you do.<br>
<br>

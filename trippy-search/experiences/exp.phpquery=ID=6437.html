8am Woke up-Drank 2 glasses Cranberry juice with 2 Centrum Mental clarity. Nothing to eat since 11pm last night<BR>
<BR>
10am Drank 1/2 liter Water - Mesured out 100mg 2ct7 and divided into 8 even parts.<BR>
<BR>
12pm 12-17mg Oral 2ct7  - 1 glass Cranberry<BR>
<BR>
12:15pm 1 glass water<BR>
<BR>
12:45 No noticable effects<BR>
<BR>
1:15 Silght Visual and Audial Distortion (like 1/2 hit lsd) Slight Stomach discomfort<BR>
<BR>
1:30 Strong visuals 5+hits lsd  - Not as sick anymore<BR>
<BR>
1:45 Vomit for 5 minutes<BR>
<BR>
2:15 - 6pm Visuals so strong I cannot see what is acutally infront of me. I know that my wife is there but when I look outside it appears like the visuals I have in the dark when on acid. I cannot hold thoughts for more then a few seconds. I cannot comprehend letters. Everytime I look at my wife and my dog I cry. Nothing matters except them. I feel as though I have taken an ounce of mushrooms. I gag every few minutes. Jesus Christ, 1mg should have been enough. This is in no way, shape, or form, a light dose. I feel that if I have taken more then this that I would have died.<BR>
<BR>
7pm everything is still moving like 5 hits of acid, I am calmer, but all I can do is apologise to my wife. I party maybe once every 5 weeks or so (somtimes not for 3-4 months at a time), but I have conviced myself that I have a drug problem. My wife explains to me that everything is going to be fine, I do not have a problem, its just that this drug blew my mind and fucked with my emotions. It takes me several hours to realize that she is right, but until then I have this fear that I fucked up and her and my dog would be taken away any second.<BR>
<BR>
9pm light visuals, much calmer then ever an hour ago. We sit down to watch the Sopranos.<BR>
<BR>
10pm - I try to sleep. My head feel like I have be hit with a hammer (kinda like when you hit your head on an open cabinet) I take 2 pain killers, ever an hour later the pain does not subside. <BR>
<BR>
1am After not being able to sleep, I get up and take a shower. Where my kidneys are, is sore.<BR>
<BR>
2am I watch TV and have a chicken sandwich.<BR>
<BR>
3am Still light visuals - Very annoying at this point, MAKE IT STOP AND LET ME SLEEP. +15 hours<BR>
<BR>
4:30am I lay down in bed to try and sleep. I lay there for an hour before I finally do, feeling pain like I haven't feel like since the day after my last 2 week heroin binge.<BR>
<BR>
8:00pm +32 hours Still disorented, still tracers. Maybe tomorrow morning everything will be normal.<BR>
<BR>
 I'll stick to shrooms not that the rainy season is comming. 2CT7 is too much. Had I know that was what was going to happen a such a light dose I would have never taken it. I cannot believe that someone would snort 3-4 times what I took orally..<!--   End Body   -->

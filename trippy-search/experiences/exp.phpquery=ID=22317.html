I've been curious about the dissociative experience for a while. The notion of being cut away from my senses to live in a world of mind alone intrigued me, and the possibility of encountering alien entities and vistas seemed interesting. Accounts I had read in William White's FAQ had a very Lovecraftian tone, albeit much more benign, and I found that to be a particularly alluring facet of the DXM experience. I thought it might give me some insight into Lovecraft's writing and into the work of other artists preoccupied with alien form, motive, and substance (Giger comes to mind).<BR>
<BR>
After a particularly profound, transformative DPT experience (see <A HREF="exp.phpquery=ID=21923.html">Nihilist Mysticism</a>), dissociatives began to interest me for other reasons as well. My essentially mystical contact with the concept of death made me wonder: people on dissociatives often seem to be indifferent to whether they die. Why? What is it about the experience which seems to destroy our practically instinctual fear of dying?<BR>
<BR>
I thought a high-dose DXM experience (third or fourth plateau) could serve as a sort of allegorical death; dissociation would represent the cleavage of mind from body. The question that preoccupied me was this: if it's possible to look at dissociation as a death-like state, what does that imply about the mind? What can we learn about where the mind goes after death from the dissociative experience? Philosophically this is a bit suspect - I don't even know if I believe in the idea that the mind persists after death - but it's something I'd like to explore more in the future.<BR>
<BR>
In short, my interest in dissociatives stemmed partly from desire for more mundane insight (deepening my essential understanding of certain works of art) and partly from a fundamental philosophical curiosity. Although the experience that follows didn't shed light on art at all, it illuminated certain aspects of using the dissociative experience as a model for death; it also made clear to me that I don't want to repeat the DXM experience - at least not at the same dose and in the same form. Any further exploration with dissociatives on my part will probably begin with ketamine instead.<BR>
<BR>
Without further ado, here's what went down:<BR>
<BR>
I picked up a 237 mL bottle of 3 mg/mL Robitussin Maximum Strength cough syrup a few weeks back. I have a strong stomach, so I was pretty sure I would be able to handle the miniscule amount of alcohol and the thickening agents. My plan was to drink the entire thing using the method laid out in White's FAQ; if you do the math, that turns out to be 711 mg of DXM. I weigh about 55 kg, so that works out to 12.9 mg/kg, a high third plateau to low fourth plateau dose.<BR>
<BR>
I got around to doing this last Friday around 3 PM, when a friend, L, came over. L has previous experience with dissociatives, and we've tried many different substances together, so I asked him to be my sitter. He readily agreed. My set was fairly gloomy; I had performed disappointingly on a test that morning, and the grey weather and slushy streets that had persisted all winter were really starting to get me down. I was excited about the experience, though, and felt it wouldn't affect things appreciably. My setting would be my comfortably furnished room; I planned to stay in bed the whole time. <BR>
<BR>
As L and another friend looked on, I slammed the bottle of syrup as quickly as possible (I had been eating some crackers and french fries shortly before to dampen the shock to my kidneys). I decided to lie down so that once the experience began in earnest I would be safe; L sat down in my easy chair and kept me company. Another friend, W, came in and started playing Animal Crossing, and I was happy to have the pleasantly repetitive music lull me into what I was sure would be an amazing experience.<BR>
<BR>
After about an hour, I wasn't feeling anything except for a little queasiness, and I was burping a bit. L walked off for a while, leaving me in the room with W. Soon I felt sick enough that I finally got up and threw up most of the food and cough syrup. Although I thought this would probably terminate the experience, I was sorely mistaken.<BR>
<BR>
Within about two hours I was feeling faint, and my sense of touch began to deaden - I could still feel myself touch things if I concentrated, but it took a lot of effort. Soon my sense of touch became too unreliable - I felt what I suppose were sensory echoes instead of actual sensations - and I began periodically asking L if my heart had stopped. I would ask him this question multiple times throughout the afternoon and evening.<BR>
<BR>
This question was motivated by a feeling of both apprehension and invincibility; in fact, this is the only part of the experience which was relevant to my philosophical questions about why dissociatives destroy fear of death - in me, anyway. I was so convinced that death would be identical to the state I was in that, were I to die, it would simply be permanent dissociation. I'm definitely not convinced of that now, but it's one of myriad disturbing hypotheses about what occurs at and after the moment of<BR>
death.<BR>
<BR>
After an hour or two of feeling uncomfortably anesthetized, I somehow hauled my body out of bed to the bathroom, L in tow. I slumped to the ground next to the toilet and started retching my guts out. The rest of the experience is very much a blur, but the general outline is this: L sat on the floor reading and checking on me while I passed in and out of consciousness and the dissociated state. Every once in a while I would either spit some phlegm or continue vomiting. The entire time this was happening, I hallucinated about the slushy streets of the city; I had endless visions of looking down on a wet patch of road.<BR>
<BR>
An hour and a half or so later, I felt better and got up. L was relieved, because at one point I had passed out for a few minutes; between that and the fact that my pupils were asymmetric, he thought I may have suffered some brain damage. I dragged myself into bed nevertheless and went to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
When I woke up it was around 9 PM, I was still very intoxicated; in fact, I felt quite brain damaged. I got up anyway, and walked around the dorm for a bit. I was highly amused by the robowalk; I felt as though all of my limbs had 8 joints which wobbled and rippled as I moved. Onlookers later told me that I was walking perfectly normally but extremely slowly, which seems to contradict the description of the classical robowalk (huge, flowing motions). This provoked some comment and some concern, but I had already started to feel more normal, so I wasn't too worried.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, I went to sleep. When I woke up again the next day, I definitely felt unmotivated. I also felt acutely for maybe the first time that perhaps my approach to exploring the wide world of psychoactive substances was getting a bit self-destructive. After all, what if I *had* suffered a brain hemorrhage?<BR>
<BR>
With that in mind, I've resolved to consider dosages a little more  carefully when trying new substances in the future. More importantly, I've decided to tone down the frequency with which I go tripping. I wouldn't want tripping to become a commonplace, humdrum thing, and this way my weekends won't fall into a pattern of tripping and recuperating.<BR>
<BR>
Even so, I'm excited about what lies around the corner. There are so many interesting substances to try, and they promise *such* a depth and variety of experience. One unpleasant trip lacking in insight out of a large number of joyful, informative, and transformative ones isn't that bad. And now that I'll be spending less time tripping, I'll get to sample new and different experiences *outside* of my head. The future is bright.<!--   End Body   -->

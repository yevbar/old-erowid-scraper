I started taking valerian to ease some anxiety and general stir-craziness.  I was at the point where I was easily aggitated by many tiny stressful situations.  I took these pills with a cup of water before bedtime usually around midnight.  This first time I took one valerian pill, and felt tired within a half hour, the next day I woke feeling like a saint, and felt unusually kind during situations that bothered me before.  I also had felt more energetic the whole day, after an hour or two of mild grogginess upon awakening.  The next time I took two pills and had the same effects.  It began as a miracle.<br>
<br>
After taking a week break, and having such success I decided to try it again.  Two pills did nothing for me the third time, except make me tired and somewhat unwilling to sleep for 2 hours while being exhausted.  The fourth time I took it I felt aggitated and could not sleep for 3 hours, the next day was never the same, and I felt no different.  So I cut the dose to 1 pill the next day, and I felt like my dreams were becomming too deep, I would wake up several times in the middle of the night because of numbness in my arms and legs.  <br>
<br>
The sixth time, the numbness came on within 30 minutes of lying down.  The seventh time I tried to dodge the numb feeling by taking it immediately before bed - this time was weirder because I felt like I couldn't wake up, like I had been paralyzed.<br>
<br>
Finally, the eigth time I took this pill, I had the worst dream inside dreams.  I felt like I wanted to wake up - I decided I would start moving my arms - but the more I tried to move them the more numb / restrained I felt.  Then I tried to do a sit up and felt completely paralyzed.  I felt like my entire body was being crushed.  Then an overwhelming pain entered my brain - like my jellybrain had been turned into a giant brittle potato chip and that someone was crushing me in.  I was certain this was the end - that I had finally killed myself with herbs.  I told myself 'No, you can't let it end this way' and willed it away.  I don't know it was a dream or reality to this day, but I suspect it was a dream inside a dream.  It is a shame because I was so sure the effects were GREAT and then it never worked the same.  Even when I cut the dose to half a pill I had the same insomnia/numbness.<!--   End Body   -->

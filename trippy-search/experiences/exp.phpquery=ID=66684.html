<!--   Start Body   -->


I took ecstacy for the first time at this huge rave in LA. It took a while for me to start feeling something, but I would say the first sign was that I couldn't stop dancing. I normally don't like electronic music, but I didn't mind it at all when I was rolling. I would say I got a body high more pleasant than acid, kind of similar to being really coked up at a club or something (but not nervous or jittery though). Anyway, my body felt amazing as I was moving around.<br>
<br>
Some people say that E makes you really emotional and horny, but I didn't really feel too much of that. Maybe it's because I'm not really a romantic person and am more private with my emotions. I did feel more emotionally close to my friends though, but it wasn't anything  too intense like what I was expecting. I definetely feel more 'one' with the world and feel love towards people during the first two or three hours of an acid trip. <br>
<br>
Anyway, after about 5 or 6 hours of dancing, my friends and I left and drove back home. We smoked a bowl of some pretty strong weed in the car, and that's when I started tripping balls. It was kind of like acid, but also really different.<br>
<br>
First, I started to hallucinate, similar to an acid trip. My friends' faces looked different and from the corner of my eye some stuff looked really unusual (for example, I kept on seeing my friends face looking out the window in the passengers seat when in reality she wasn't even faced towards the window...)  I was starting to get a little nervous, but then I told myself that I am safe. I was looking out the window and I was fascinated my all the streetlights. I couldn't decipher what alot of things around me were, things that I would normally be able to comprehend. Then I started having close eyed visuals, but with bright lights, not intricate patterns. The unusual thing was that as I closed my eyes, I started drifting away from the universe. I couldn't comprehend what my friends were talking about and became really in tune with my mind and body.  Then I started to dissociate, and my mind and body were completely detached from one another.  It was the most bizarre feeling I have ever felt, I can't even explain it, but it was amazing.  It was almost as if my skin was vibrating and slowly drifting away from my body, I couldn't feel my body at all (it's not the same numbness you experience on opiates), but my mind was still functioning. <br>
<br>
I then started to think about about all these philosophical connections between body and mind, unfortunetely I forgot what they were. I was able to snap out of it, but I didn't want to because the feeling was so weird and so amazing. Oh yea, I also 'stepped out of myself', meaning that I was able to observe myself from a completely detached point of view, so I would 'watch' myself walk. My perception of depth and space was off, I thought things were closer by than they were and vice versa. <br>
<br>
The main difference between this and acid is that on acid, I feel the world around me is surreal, but when I was tripping on e/weed, it was me who was surreal.  When I got home, I brushed my teeth and washed my face, but even then I felt like my mind was totally seperate from my body. <br>
<br>
My friends didn't experience this, so I didn't have anyone to talk to later on who could understand what I was going through. I've never tried K, but I imagine it's something similar to what I felt. This experience has definetely gotten me more interested in dissociative drugs.<!--   End Body   -->

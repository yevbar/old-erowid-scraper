On a dull afternoon during the summer, I spent part of the morning hanging out with a close friend of mine who was currently big into the business of selling Adderall at his school, despite the legal risks. Around 1:00 PM, he offered me one of his 30mg Adderall capsules, which he had been prescribed for his ADHD. I am a naturally calm person and have no disorder even close to hyperactivity, so I knew an amphetamine would effect me to a high degree. I took it reluctantly since I was inept at swallowing pills, but got it down successfully nonetheless.<br>
<br>
After about a half-hour, I experienced a newfound burst of energy. I could not stop walking, and my legs seemed to be powered by remote controls and were moving in whatever direction they desired, as if searching for some task that needed to be done. This action created a strange sensation, in which my upper body felt detached from my legs at the waist and was struggling to keep up with them. I also became uncharacteristically social, jabbering on endlessly to my friend, who seemed to be in silent awe of this odd new personality that had risen up from inside me. Normally, I dislike talking too much and will just make brief statements with few details. But now I was embellishing on the simplest things, throwing in every possible analysis for something as trivial as a grease spot in the middle of the street.<br>
<br>
I loved these sensations, but after an hour, the effects seemed to be wearing off. Since I had been so energized previously, the slightest fading of this stimulation felt like a comedown to me. So, I pleaded with my friend to have the last pill in his bottle. He was supposed to take his last dosage for the day before his next refill, but it went to me instead. Around the hour mark, I ingested another 30mg capsule and decided that would be enough. That was an understatement. It was MORE than enough.<br>
<br>
Another half-hour or 45 minutes passed, and the feelings I'd experienced after the first pill greatly intensified. All of the effects I felt while 'peaking' washed in during a 90-minute bike ride we went on after dark. This was when I felt I was losing touch with the Adderall (if you will) and that the effects of it were dominating me instead of me safely controlling them. Some of these new sensations got to such an intense apex that they frightened me.<br>
<br>
The easy socialization was a plus, and I enjoyed it immensely. Rather than stumbling for words like I usually do, entire paragraphs were flowing from my tongue as if I was reading from a piece of paper. My friend and I had switched roles. He was usually the talkative one, but he was now merely the listener, and I couldn't thank him enough for putting up with me. But then, the weirdness set in. I crossed the threshold of appreciating my friend's company and began to get a sensation of being all-powerful. I would look at him with a feeling of repugnance, as if it was foolish of me to be hanging around with somebody of much lower than intelligence than I. I had completely forgotten the last two years we'd spent hanging out and having great times. I now looked at him as a lowlife. Since my legs were so strong and I could pedal my bike for a long period of time without so much as breathing heavily, it was incredibly tough for him to keep up with me.<br>
<br>
Finally, we settled back at my house and I was expecting to sit down in my computer chair and jolt right back up. Instead, every muscle in my body sank right into the grooves of the chair and calmed down to near-numbness. Once I felt I was settled, I didn't want to get back up. Eventually, I had to go upstairs for the meal. We had pizza for supper, and two bites into my slice, I was shocked by my distaste for any kind of food or beverage, and I did not foresee any bathroom urges coming on for quite a while. As we went back downstairs, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and saw that my pupils had bulged to an alarming size. My new goal was to stay as far away from my parents as possible, to avoid detection.<br>
<br>
Around midnight, we went to bed. My friend settled into a sleeping bag and was out in a matter of an hour or so. I, however, did not have the typical thoughts going through my mind around bedtime. Usually, I would think about the happenings of the day and what I would do tomorrow. This time, I felt as if the day was just beginning and was considering prodding my pal to put his clothes back on so we could go for a drive. I ditched the idea and spent the entire night wide awake, but with my eyes closed. No amount of effort towards emptying my mind could get me to sleep. I killed time in the early morning hours by pondering theories of astronomy, while jumping at every creak. The darkness of my room brought on major paranoia.<br>
<br>
I got out of bed at around 7:00, taking note that all of the effects had flushed out and I was now my normal self. However, new feelings had crept in, and I identified this as the dreaded speed hangover. Since hunger was now an issue, I gulped down a bowl of Frosted Flakes, which did not settle well. My stomach had a dull ache running through it, that was different and more unpleasant than the traditional stomachache. About 20 minutes later, I vomited my breakfast and felt MUCH better. I was still exhausted like I'd just run a marathon, minus the sweating and rapid heartbeat. The hangover lasted most of the day, and it was not a fun thing. I was abnormally sluggish and had a nauseous feeling constantly running through me, but it would never accumulate to an urge to throw up. It would just remain an uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach. The sleep I got the night after the hangover was great.<!--   End Body   -->

A few years ago I had the chance to taste this rather exotic tryptamine. I only got one capsule containing 15 mg, so I couldn't share the experience with friends. Rather than tripping with friends on different substances, I decided to take the capsule while being alone - though I usually don't do psychedelics on my own.<br>
<br>
The guy who sold me the capsule hadn't tried it himself, and didn't know very much about it. Except it shouldn't be too long-lasting, and that the dose would probably be a bit on the weak side for people experienced with psychedelics.<br>
<br>
T-0:00 : About 7 pm I ingested the capsule. Doing a bit of writing on the computer, while listening to some nice music.<br>
<br>
T-0:25 : I feel a first alert. Definate tryptamine-energy creeping up my spine. Maybe a slight bit of nausea. I decide to quit the computer, and just lay on my bed to see where this is taking me.<br>
<br>
T-0:35 : This stuff sure kicks in quick. I check in the mirror, and my pupils are moderately dilated. The music sure sounds nice, but no visual effects whatsoever.<br>
<br>
T-0:40 : It's getting impossible for me to relax at all. I feel extremely stimulated, but don't really want to leave my small dorm room. I'm sure it's very obvious I'm tripping at this point, and people are a bit up tight about that around here. I decide to try to learn myself how to juggle, with different things laying around the room. My mind is racing a bit, but not in a distinct psychedelic kind of way. I change music a lot. I never learn how to juggle, though I try for a long time. Having fun, though.<br>
<br>
T-2:30 : Can it be that the effects are already subsiding? I had hoped for a longer experience. No visuals manifested at any time during the trip.<br>
<br>
T-4:30 : Just a slight bit of effect left. I go to the dorm kitchen and drink a couple of beers with some friends. I get a good night's sleep after a couple of hours.<br>
<br>
This compound reminded me definitely most about 5-MeO-DIPT. Same kind of restless tryptamine push, and nothing too deeply psychedelic. However, I had the feeling that larger doses of this substance might be much more worthwhile than large doses of 5-MeO-DIPT. The stimulated feeling was more comfortable and not quite as pushy.<!--   End Body   -->

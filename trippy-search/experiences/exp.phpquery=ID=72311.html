<!--   Start Body   -->


I am a 19 year old male with a fairly wide experience of drugs, and in terms of psychedelic substances have experimented with LSD, Psilocybin mushrooms, Ketamine, Nitrous, LSA seeds and Yopo seeds. I am a habitual marijuana smoker and studying Maths at university in the UK.<br>
<br>
Several weeks ago, I managed to acquire a sample 2C-E through a reliable source, as well as some 0.001mg scales. Over the next few weeks, I sampled the substance in a few different doses, from 2 mg insufflated to 14mg orally. The latter of these was not too intense at all, though visuals were overpowering at times.<br>
<br>
For my experience the setting was almost perfect, just moved into a house with some of my student friends the day before. I had a free afternoon, so carefully weighed out 17mg.<br>
<br>
T + 0:00 - I swallowed the dose wrapped in a small piece of paper. I went round the house, told my house mates I had just taken a potent research chemical so I didn’t have to try and explain after I started tripping (its possibly my least favourite thing). I felt fairly normal for the first 50 minutes or so, and just spent my time tidying my new bedroom. <br>
<br>
T + 0:40 – Visual disturbances start occurring, shadows forming over shapes and plain walls, patterns forming<br>
<br>
T+ 1:20 - Disturbances in my visual field became more and more obvious, a tribal diamond like shape formed everywhere, connecting marks on the wall as if those marks were important points on the shape. My flat mates were hanging around and I started to feel uncomfortable, the feeling of a necessity to change body position, it became difficult to remain comfortable. As the visuals became more and more pronounced, I suddenly felt myself being propelled into what I could only describe as an extremely overpowering “different world”. I was somewhere I had never been before with any psychoactive substance. <br>
<br>
Closed eye visuals were very colourful and in what appeared to be 3 dimensions. I was overcome with the most intense paranoia I had ever had, but I did not even know what i was paranoid about, even at the time I knew I had nothing to be paranoid about, I was in the safe hands of my housemates, and there was no one coming to get me. The mindset I was in, and the setting of the experiment was almost perfect, it was just too intense for my mind to cope with.<br>
<br>
T + 1:40 - I walked around the house to try and calm down, trying to distract myself from the feelings I was experiencing. I went into my mates room, told him I was the most fucked I had even been and was never going to get that high ever again, then insisted on playing some guitar through his effects pedal. As I played, it didn’t feel like I was there, as if it was not my body, the guitar floated in my hands.I couldn’t continue this for long, I felt uncomfortable again and persisted to move to a different room. At one point, my friend gave me a pen and paper to draw and help me calm down, but I couldn’t cope, I was drawing lines which were just making me panic more.<br>
<br>
T + 2:00 – Paranoia persisted. Started to see the ‘Universes in the walls’ that I tend to see when I am tripping. Very sensitive to the warm and cold or slightly uncomfortable positions. Time dilation by this point was very extreme, I felt like I had been in a place for several hours when really it was most likely several minutes. I noticed when watching the television, that the movement of people on the screen seemed broken slightly, as if my own vision had increased its ‘frame rate’ to a speed of which is greater than the television image. <br>
<br>
T + 5:00 – By this time, I was still tripping very heavily, but paranoia had stopped. This was either due to the fact it was dark outside by then and I had less fear of people coming to get me in the night, or the fact that I felt more controlled under the influence of the substance, I understood how to control myself and my thoughts.  <br>
<br>
T + 11:00 – Now 3am, I still felt in a very altered state of consciousness, very confused about the day, my life and everything, I decided to get some sleep. Difficulty in sleeping, very strong closed eye visuals still exist.<br>
<br>
T + 48:00 - I still do not quite feel back to baseline, there are still visual disturbances occurring on empty walls, shadows appearing over areas and moving across them, and a definite altered perception (colours seeming more vivid and people seeming larger) which I hope will disappear within the next couple of days.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, this substance should be approached with extreme caution, trips are very long lasting (I won’t expect less than 6 hours for any dose). I do not expect to be back to reality for quite a while. The experience can be difficult in the sense that getting comfortable and being ‘happy’ throughout is not particularly easy to achieve. I'd definitely avoid this material if I didn't have experience with any psychedelic, as an Acid trip is an ‘easy ride’ in comparison (in my opinion).<br>
<br>
It will however be a substance I will experiment with again, but with plenty of free days following it. It was a very insightful experience but even after 60 hours after dosing, I am still concerned that the 'shadows in space' are still commonly in the forefront of my visual field.<!--   End Body   -->

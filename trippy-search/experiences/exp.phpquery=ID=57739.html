Ok lets cut to the chase - this wasn't a meticulously engineered cocktail. Things just unfolded as they do in my crazy life. My friend came down to London and suggested that we score some hallucinogens. We decided to be good citizens and go legal. A shop in Camden made that happen. The woman at the counter was a complete waste of space, she had zero credibility and blithely assured us that 4 seeds would be plenty, but having done HBW once and been sorely dissappointed by the lacklustre experience of mild dizziness and occassional blurring of vision  - We decided to up the ante and go for 12 each. We got home in a hurry and and chewed the lot thoroughly after a determined searched for a mortar and pestle yielded nada. It did not matter as the seeds crunched easily under our teeth, tasting slightly bitter. We both braced ourself for an hour or so of chewing the fat before feeling an effect. <br>
<br>
Minutes later however we were both experiencing a certain edginess suggesting the faint but definite prodrome of a trip. We had both eaten a substantial meal about 2 hours before. I lay on the bed reading a book, while Ronin - my friend, watched TV in the living room. A half hour later both of us began feeling really drowsy. My body tingled a bit and I closed my eyes, but there were no closed eye visuals. It was a bit like the tail end of a weed trip and about as exciting as taking an antihistamine. I must have dozed off for a few minutes, experiencing dream like imagery that I cannot recall. We both sighed and cursed our luck, wondering whether this was going to be the glorious entirety of the trip. Waves of nausea, overcame us every fifteen minutes or so. This was not severe but it did diminish the pleasantness of the trip and heightened our anxiety. The sedation diminished when I walked around and I found that it was a good way to increase my energy levels. Like other hallucinogens - the HBW edginess could transmute into a sexual state. <br>
<br>
Ronin found himself masturbating, having decided that this transmutation would be more enjoyable than anxiety. I was banished to the living room. I walked around trying to relax but found my self feeling nauseous. I wondered whether the nausea for a physicalization of a psychological state of worry. Going by my earlier ayahuasca experience I thought this could be so - it was difficult to separate the two. Both fed into a kind of vicious circle that tended to perpetuate each other. I went to the toilet and tried to vomit. I only managed to retch a few times, but felt much better thereafter. Lying down on the couch in the living room I began to to think -  'OK. Lets not go into the usual bad trip traps of sexual or existential angst.' I threw out my old scripts and decided to think up new ones.<br>
<br>
I would deconstruct my psyche using my knowledge of Jungian psychology. The next few minutes were incredibly productive. I had profound insights into myself and moments of intuitively grasping all that I had read - solidly grounding the theory I had read earlier. I interpreted the anxiety as a tempermental anima, a female archetype that according to Jung resides in the psyche of all men. Characterising it as such enabled a creative emancipation that made me laugh and sigh. The world was a beautiful place again! About 2 hours had passed by this time. Lace like patterns raced across the ceiling and patterns swished around the shadows. I was enjoying introspecting so much, I didn't really fancy shooting the shit with Ronin. <br>
<br>
He came out of the bedroom with a vial of Amyl Nitrite. He was clearly having a pleasurable rush. He offered me a deep whiff and I instantly felt an intense popper rush that intensified my visuals and left me ecstatic in a way that does not really happen when used by themselves. The poppers interesting changed the nature of the closed eye visuals, I was experiencing - making them more geometrical and DMT like.<br>
<br>
An hour later we both took some Zaleplon. For those not in the know, Zaleplon by itself has interesting mildly hallucinogenic effects. It also reduces anxiety which in itself I speculated could reduce nausea. The combination worked like a charm and minutes later we felt much better. The nausea was reduced but not eliminated. Poppers were highly pleasurable and euphoric with the combination. The added tripiness of the Zaleplon worked synergistically to create a novel mind ambience that was similar to 2CB - psychedelic with an mdma like feeling of relaxation. I thought that premedication with dramamine or cinnarizine several hours prior would be a good idea next time and made a mental note. I tried to beat one out too later, just for the heck of it, but I was as useless as a rubber chicken in a brothel. <br>
<br>
I was rudely interrupted by Ronin, who was now cribbing about how staying in the house was giving him bad vibes and how he needed to go out and try to pull women. I decided to be a dissenter and stay at home with my thoughts, but Ronin's pestering was seriously fucking my head up, and I wanted to get him off my back. 'What the hell', I rationalised, 'lets do it .... all for the experience'. I put my clothes on fighting back waves of nausea, which seemed to increase the more I stood up and walked around. We walked into the cold night air, Ronin instantly feeling better and me feeling more nauseous with every step. Screw it I thought. Lets retch and get it out. I did and felt better.<br>
<br>
We go to a cocktail lounge/dance club near my house. Ryan is happy as can be and sets about getting himself a JD and Coke before he strutted his stuff, targeting some broads. I couldn't have cared less about the impressive range of ass on display. I was enveloped in a psychedelic bubble of indifference and mild disdain for the entire scene. Strangely this seemed attractive to some women there who kept trying to chat me up. Perhaps I projected a good energy. It was pretty amusing and kind of surreal - almost hallucinatory! A very attractive girl came up to me and asked me about my glasses. Ronin seized the opportunity to dance with her friend, who was very pretty. Ordinarily I would have been on her like greased lightening. At the time though I just felt slightly bemused, wanting to go home and be left alone. 'I can't handle this', I thought.<br>
<br>
Later Ronin danced with the girls for sometime, while I stood on the side, wanting desperately to leave. Ronin was in a good mood, said he experienced a nice sexual buzz on the floor - very much like mdma. He danced with the women a bit, who were friendly and receptive. I dragged him out soon enough though and we walked back home. About 7 hours had now passed but we were still tripping. We got back home and watched TV for a bit before going to sleep. I had many interesting closed eye visuals before I nodded off. They were similar to post mdma/dmt closed eye visuals. Sleep was deep and refreshing. The morning after we both experienced a sense of well being and a strange premontion that it would not be too long before we did this again.<!--   End Body   -->

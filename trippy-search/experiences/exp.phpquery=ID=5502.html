Just thought I'd report an 'alternative' form of ingesting HBWR seeds.<BR>
<BR>
My first HWBR trip was amazing. In my first report, I compared the experience to MDMA -- in that it presented me with wave after wave of a kind of almost unbearably delirious happiness for about 3 hours (6 seeds ground up in water & chewed & swallowed immediately). My second trip was marred by nausea and wretching (8 seeds ground and made into a tea -- bleecch!), and after that night, I was reluctant to try HBWR again.<BR>
<BR>
Then I had an idea. Considering LSA dissolves in water, then perhaps it can be absorbed sub-lingually, in the same way that LSD-25 and salvinorin-A are administered. My intent was to prove that I could absorb enough LSA without having to actually swallow the seeds. And believe it or not, it worked! Here's some notes from my experiment, followed by my conclusion.<BR>
<BR>
7PM Saturday -- I mash 4 seeds with a hammer and a rock. I put the powder in a shot glass and add a teaspoon of cold water -- stir. Five minutes later, I add a squeeze of lime juice and some sugar, stir, and shovel that whole mess into my mouth. It takes some getting used to to have a mouth full of seed grit. The seeds have no noticeable taste (thank god). I can only hold onto the mixture for 15 minutes, but I've already noticed a kind of light buzz, and a change in how I focus my thoughts. After spitting out the slurry, I enjoy a light, sedated feeling, very pleasant -- time is going by fast, then slow, then fast. The music is extremely enjoyable. My heart is racing, and my thoughts are positive. After an hour, I am able to go about doing chores etc.<BR>
<BR>
11PM -- I grind up another 6 seeds. I want to see if LSA can be 'boosted' withough losing effectiveness entirely. This time I add a couple of teaspoons of water, then a tablespoon of orange juice. The lime juice I added last time seemed to make my mouth salivate a bit much. I then hold the seed grit in my mouth for about 15 minutes. This time, within 5 minutes, I start to notice cartoon buddha CEVs, and I think to myself, holy shit, this is it.<BR>
<BR>
The sedation is very strong. I can see why people would classify this plant as an intoxicant as opposed to a psychedelic. I think it's a little of both, actually.<BR>
<BR>
For about 3 or 4 hours I am just lying there, wide awake and yet dreaming. Spirits enter the room, then leave. I finally start to gather my senses together, and I realize the radio has been on the whole time, and I vaguely recall having heard the new P.J. Harvey and liking it a great deal, even though I can't recall a single note of it. I get up, my stomach is fine. No puking! 5AM I kind of go to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
7PM Sunday -- having one more night to kill, I decide to use up my remaining HBWR seeds. I take 9 seeds, mash them down in the same way, add a little water, a little juice, and then hold the results in my mouth for about 20 minutes (you get the idea). An hour after spitting out the seeds, I feel very very relaxed, but my mind is working 'normally', and I decide a glass of wine would probably top off the relaxative effects (I'm normally so sick at this stage that I can't drink or eat anything).<BR>
<BR>
Then I suddenly realize, I cannot walk without staggering! I'm slurring my words, and then I'm laughing at everything. Wow, that hit me hard and fast. I continue drinking wine and smoking pot, and I am getting so wildly intoxicated. I feel so good, and I realize that I've only drunk 2 glasses of wine. The waves of gentle happiness are crashing over me, and there's dreams and I'm talking directly to friends from long ago and far away, and they're answering me. I'm seeing double, and I need to lie down. There are tracers everywhere, and when I close my eyes I instantly start dreaming -- sleep and wakefulness are merely a function of eyelid position. My body is so relaxed, and seems thankful that I've made the decision to just say hell with it, let's get blitzed.<BR>
<BR>
I came to about 4 AM, and I felt pretty good, a little groggy and over stimulated, but none the worse for wear.<BR>
<BR>
Conclusion:<BR>
<BR>
I believe that sublingual absorption allows me to experience the very pleasant intoxicating effects of HBWR without the nausea. I simply take my normal dose and add half that amount (eg: if I normally take 6 seeds swallowed, I use 9 for this method). I Grind the seeds as finely as possible, almost to a powderlike consistency. Then add a teaspoon of water, and a teaspoon or more of juice. Wait 5 minutes. Pour into mouth (including all the seed grit). DON'T SWALLOW any of it. Swirl the mush with the tongue every once in awhile. Hold for 15-30 minutes. Spit out. Go lie down, relax, have a good time.<!--   End Body   -->

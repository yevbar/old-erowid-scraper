<!--   Start Body   -->


Substance: 	17 mg 4-ACO-DiPT taken orally at 3:00 PM<br>
Date:		September 7, 2008<br>
Weather:	Sunny, a pleasant 70 degrees<br>
Other: 	        10 mg Hydrocodone taken at about 11:30 AM for back pain, still feeling  minor effects at 3:00 PM.<br>
Mental Set: 	A bit irritable from the Hydrocodone comedown, but otherwise feeling pretty relaxed and calm.<br>
<br>
T+00 - I poured the powder under my tongue and took a large swig of water. My tongue was assaulted by the worst tasting RC I have ever experienced.<br>
<br>
T+15 - I did a bit of house cleaning, then headed upstairs to get ready to go for a walk in nature with my lovely wife, I noticed first alerts as I put on my socks.<br>
<br>
T+20 - My terminally dedicated sober sitter wife took the wheel and drove us along the highway to an appropriate spot where I could experience the drug in an outstanding natural setting.  As we zoomed down the highway towards our destination, I found myself coming up uncomfortably quickly, and as I often do when taking psychedelics, I was attempting to hold a fake smile weakly upon my face, with the motivation of tricking myself into believing I was having fun.  The rumble and sway of the vehicle made this phase most unpleasant, and I was feeling a strong compulsion to get the hell out of the car.  I felt as if my brain was being buffed with a medium grain sandpaper.<br>
<br>
T+30 - We arrived at a beautiful spot along a river bank, in a gorge as wide and deep as it was breathtaking.  When I got out of the car I felt rather unsteady on my feet; detached and confused, but the feeling of solid ground beneath my feet was a welcome change from the moving automobile and I immediately began to feel better, more at ease.<br>
<br>
T+45 - Despite coming on like a hurricane, in a short time things began to smooth out quite a bit, and other than some trembling due to excess stimulation, I was beginning to feel less distracted by the body load and was able to sink in and enjoy my surroundings more.  I had thought I was in for a rocky ride, but as quickly as it had come, things had leveled out to an easy plus 2 on the Shulgin scale.<br>
<br>
T+1:00 to T+2:30 - We walked along the river, letting our bare feet sink down into the mud, which felt amazing against the bottom of my feet.  There was a benign nature to this experience, and although there were many other people in the area, I didn’t have the associated feeling of being overly conspicuous that I often have when tripping.  my impressions of strangers were warm and comfortable. This substance was mildly heart-opening.  <br>
<br>
Visually, there didn’t seem to be a lot going on, although we were in an outstanding natural area that was amazing in it’s own right.  At times there was a gentle swaying or breathing on the landscape that was certainly inspired by the substance, but it was subtle.<br>
<br>
I was feeling more connected to my surroundings, and more open emotionally to those around me. Stopping to talk to a stranger on the shore was easy and at no point did I feel unable to communicate nor was I concerned that I was acting strangely.  My wife and I had a wonderful walk together, looking at various creepy crawlies slithering in the mud, and taking silly pictures of each other walking along a precipice alongside the river.  Eventually we made our way back to the car.  The substance was definitely wearing off, and I felt no ill effects from the come-down, other than being a bit more tired than I ordinarily would be after a leisurely stroll in nature.<br>
<br>
T+3:00 Back at home, I took a bath and prepared for dinner. I felt comfortable and hungry and we enjoyed a delicious meal together.  I wasn’t quite at baseline at T+4:00, and still had a bit of confusion setting the DVD player up for a movie, but effects were very minor by this point.  Sleep was a bit difficult at 10:00 PM (T+7:00), but nothing that wasn’t solved with a Benadryl, and in the morning I felt awake and refreshed.<br>
<br>
Overall, I would give this substance a positive review, although at this dose it wasn’t overly impressive.  The come-up was abrupt and intense but it soon leveled off, so I think next time I will take a higher total dose, but administer it in two separate doses spread say an hour apart.  I would have liked to have a bit more psychological activity, and I definitely would have enjoyed more visuals.  I found this to be a very subtle substance at this dosage.<!--   End Body   -->

<!--   Start Body   -->


For two first-timers (190 lbs and 120 lbs) <br>
<br>
Preparation<br>
===========<br>
6 g Syrian Rue<br>
14 g Mimosa Hostilis<br>
1000 cc Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)<br>
6 tbsp Lemon Juice<br>
Filtered Water (approx half gallon)<br>
<br>
I crushed the Rue by hand with a mortar and pestle until it was almost a powder. This took at least half an hour of pretty hard work (I got a good-sized blister on my hand), so if you have a coffee grinder, you might want to try that instead. Then I shredded up the Mimosa into one inch long strips, about 1/4' wide each. Don't try to crush those by hand, you won't be able to and you don't need to. <br>
<br>
I prepared two solutions of filtered water, somewhere between a pint and a quart each, and added one 500 cc V-C tablet and two tbsps of lemon juice to each. <br>
<br>
I tossed one of the water solutions, and all the Rue and Mimosa, into a metal saucepan and heated until it was a low boil. Stir it often. Don't let the concoction go dry - add water as needed. I kept about an inch deep of brew. After 20 minutes, strain the brew through a metal meshed tea strainer into another container. Press down on the mush to get all the liquid out. Set container aside.<br>
<br>
Put the mush back into the saucepan and add the second water solution. Repeat process (I cheated a bit and went a bit short of 20 minutes) and empty into container.<br>
<br>
Repeat process a third time, except this time I used straight filtered water with 2 tbsp of lemon juice (no V-C this time). At this last stage, I took a potato masher and smooshed up the Rue and Mimosa in the bottom of the saucepan, to make sure I got full mileage out of the concoction. Then empty into container. You are done now with the mush and can discard it.<br>
<br>
Take the solution that's in the container and if needed, you can simmer that for a while to reduce the amount of liquid. I started to do that, but there was only about two cups total in there anyway so I skipped this last step. I poured the solution into two coffee cups, giving myself about 55% and my wife 45%. In retrospect, given our weight difference, I probably should've got more like 60/40. But perhaps it wouldn't have mattered all that much. Let stand for a few minutes to cool down if you like.<br>
<br>
Experience<br>
==============<br>
<br>
(Note: I have had some experience with Psylocibin and LSD, but it was over 20 years ago)<br>
<br>
I knew how awful the stuff was going to taste so I literally held my nose and gulped down the brew in about 4 swallows over the space of a minute. I kept my nose plugged for several minutes afterwards. I think this helped me tremendously. It prevented any automatic gag reflex which would've wasted the entire thing. My wife used a difference tact and sipped hers slowly over about 20 minutes, nostrils fully open. She seemed to want to experience it more fully, bad taste and all. She's more brave than I am.<br>
<br>
A side note - my wife hadn't eaten anything for 12 hours prior; I had eated about 6 hours prior, McDonalds no less. I am ashamed. Not really.<br>
<br>
After about 20 minutes, I started to feel a little loopy, but it was more like being slightly stoned then anything else. I suppose this was the Rue kicking in, but it's hard to tell since both ingredients were cooked together. Pleasant, relaxing, a little tingly, but not much else. After about 40 minutes I began to wonder if I had not made enough. I deliberately used less Mimosa than was recommended by almost every experienced tripper because I knew how potent DMT was, and I wanted to err on the side of caution. I would've preferred no trip at all to an insane and dangerous one. At least I had experience now in cooking the brew!<br>
<br>
My wife decided to go lie down due to her constant nausea. I had a little bit of stomach upset, but it seemed very much in control. I drank a glass of water at this point. This may also have helped out in the overall process. After that, my nausea went away completely. 100%. Whatever was going to happen, my stomach would have no part in it. I joined my wife in the bedroom and laid down. <br>
<br>
It was at this point that IT KICKED IN. Oh, my god. I was trying to say something to my wife, and my thought process just stopped. A little gremlin was in my head throwing colors all over the back of my eyelids. Curiously, my wife asked me right then if I was seeing crazy spinning colors, so I knew she was going into a similar place at the same time. From there, it quickly grew into a hard driving, frantic, spirographic, nightmarish exctasy that was to last for the next 3 hours. <br>
<br>
The best way I can describe it is have you look at the inside cover for Guns & Roses Appetite for Descruction album. The picture of the demon jumping over the fence to slay the rapist robot. Those are the imps that ran the film projector for the event. Totally bizarre and sometimes frightening images dancing madly across the ceiling and in my head. Could these be the maninkari, the spirits the ayahusaqueros talk about? Probably not. If anything these were simple puppets controlled by forces unseen by this entry-level tripper. Fortunately, I never felt threatened by them. They were just there to entertain, and not dominate - I'm assuming because of the low dosage we took.<br>
<br>
The colors were astonishing. I can't describe the vibrancy. Spinning wheels of flourescence and dancing gemoetric patterns were constant throughout the entire experience. Thousands of vacant eyes popping out of the walls. Mouths opening up on the ceiling as it breathed. Brilliant lights shining through any crack, real or perceived.<br>
<br>
By the way, it was almost impossible to talk. I tried to describe my experiences to my wife, and she to me, but neither of us could get very far before we had to drift off to stare with dropped jaw to yet more craziness. I babbled like a toddler for a while. <br>
<br>
As it became more frenzied, the gremlins became more bold. Smiles turned into grimaces. Laughter turned into teeth gnashing. I had the opportunity to go deeper. I was asked by Them if I wanted to go deeper. I considered it, but decided against it.<br>
<br>
I needed to maintain a hold on reality. For one, my wife was having a difficult experience and I needed to keep my head around that. Two, I am not young anymore and I didn't want some dumbassed cardiac failure. And three, this experience was so new, so novel, that I didn't know where it might end up. I guess I'm a cautious tripper if that isn't an oxymoron. So, I got up and left the bedroom and fed the cats. I put a couple of dishes away and then returned to bed. It was difficult to walk, but I was able to see just fine. My cats didn't become dogs, and my dishes didn't run away with the spoons. It felt good to know I had self-control for the experience. Perhaps at some later attempt I'll truly let go, but it's better to have this grounding at first, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
From then on it was just pure enjoyment of the show. It lasted a couple more hours before I was finally able to drift off to sleep. It's funny that the images became more mundane as the brew wore off, but no less visual. 1960s metal lunch boxes and classic highway billboard advertisements were buzzing around for the next 45 minutes. The colors became more subdued, yellows, light blues, light greens. Much different from the insane color explosions earlier. Very pleasant but also somewhat painfully nostalgic. Weird. <br>
<br>
At this point I became very introspective. I unpeeled myself to see if I could see anyone in there. It was frightening at first because I didn't find any core, only the onion peels. Was I just a shell of a man? Well, maybe. But then I realized that my life was a series of experiences and that it's the experience that makes the man (so they say), so I didn't despair too much. I did realize how self-centered I've been all my life, and I vowed to the gods and to my wife to change that. <br>
<br>
My wife, unfortunately, had a less thrilling experience. Although she saw wonderful, awe-inspiring things, it was tempered by her constant nausea. Finally, after about three hours into it, she finally was able to purge it all out and was at least able to drift off into colorful sleep. <br>
<br>
I stayed awake for another hour or so, letting the experiencing slowly seep away. One thing I was grateful for was how little of a hangover there was (none). Just less and less intensity until I was back to full reality. Very nice. I woke up the next morning still kind of high (gentle buzzing) and I pleasantly sobered up throughout the day.<!--   End Body   -->

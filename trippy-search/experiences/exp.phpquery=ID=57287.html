I slipped into the K-hole..<br>
<br>
I saw myself as a child playing on the playground of my elementary school, I saw my days of gymnastics class, tap, ballet jazz, and toe.. I watched myself as I started running toward the vault.. I told my teacher it was too high.. that was the day I smashed my face into it, broke my nose and quit gymnastics.. Too bad I was pretty good at it.. I remembered the awesome feelings of flying through the air on uneven bars, the nervousness of trying to stay on a 4' beam in times of pressure.. and the rush from each tumbling pass on the floor..<br>
<br>
I saw myself as a pre-teen playing basketball, volleyball, tennis, softball, soccer, and bowling.. I saw my old teammates, I talked to them.. I caught up with them.. I saw myself on the stage during academic track performing an interpretive reading. I saw my old friends, we all looked so young.. I saw band class where I learned to play the clarinet.. I watched myself smoke my first cigarette with the neighbor kids in the woods, the first time we got our hands on some wine coolers in 7th grade..<br>
<br>
I saw myself as a teenager just trying to get through the day.. The feeling of being outcasted came back as if I was still there. I saw myself in classes, my old teachers, and peers. I watched as I went to my first party and smoke weed for the first time.. I watched as I lost my virginity at the age of 14.. I saw myself with ex boyfriends, relived the pain of breaking up.. I relived my parents divorce, my mom screaming that my dad had done something terrible.. how I locked myself in the bathroom for hours, half in shock.<br>
<br>
And then the worst of it.. I met my son.. the son I aborted at the age of 18.. He said he understood, and that he forgives me.. he was beautiful.. The perfect child.. and at that moment I just began to cry.. how could I do such a horrible and selfish thing.. I saw myself laying on that table, I screamed and tried to stop myself.. not go through with it.. I wanted my baby.. But I watched as that doctor ripped my son from my womb, I saw myself scream in pain, it was the worst moment of my life and I was being forced to relive it.. I turned back to the beautiful child standing next to me, and he started bleeding everywhere.. his arms were ripped off, his legs.. it was the most gory thing I have ever witnessed.. he looked at me and said 'goodbye mommy' and then the doctor grabbed him by the head, and twisted until it popped off..<br>
<br>
This was definately an eye-opening experience.. It was scary and extremely depressing.. but I do not regret it.. I have been locking away grief and it found a way out.. It may be some time before I do this drug again.. but I will.. I am glad it happened.. it gave me a reason to look at it, and now I can start to deal with it.. and hopefully finally heal..<!--   End Body   -->

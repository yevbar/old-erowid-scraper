Let me first say that I am a very experienced user of DXM and have done it many times.  I will briefly summarize my multitude of experiences before going on and describing what my experiences are currently like.  <br>
<br>
My first experience was very harsh and unenjoyable.  A friend of mine that is a friend no longer gave me a third/fourth plateau dose of DXM in capsule form.  I had such intense hot flashes and nausea mixed with sensory overload (it irritated me to hear others speak) that it made me never want to try it again.  This trip was much harsher than LSD, and I wouldn't advise anyone who isn't 1)fearless and 2)very mentally stable and strong-willed to try DXM at higher plateaus.  <br>
<br>
I stayed away from DXM for about 6 months after this experience, but one day I began to remember that I had seen on the DXM FAQ that the lower plateaus were markedly different than the upper plateaus.  I'm very glad that I remembered this now because I would have missed out on some truly unforgettable experiences.  I began to take doses of DXM within the first plateau range (according to the DXM FAQ), which amounted to 1.5-2.5 mg DXM/kg (usually about 3 to 4 capfuls of Robitussin Maximum Strength Cough, and sometimes Cough and Cold, which also contains pseudoephedrine, a slight stimulant safe at lower plateau doses).  <br>
<br>
Sometimes, I would creep slightly on over to the second plateau, especially if I sustained my trip by redosing.  For example, one very memorable time (during the year 2000) was when I took an initial dose of DXM within the first plateau range (4 capfuls for my weight) around 6 PM.  I tripped from then until the early morning hours on the first dose, and I then took another few capfuls around 2 PM and another few capfuls around 6 PM.  I continued to trip until about 10 in the morning.  During this trip, I coined the nickname 'devil' for myself when I looked in the mirror, saw a fiery glimmer in my eyes, and said with a feeling of invincibility: 'I am the devil.'  I of course didn't think I literally was the devil as Christianity sees it; my meaning was more one of being a fiery rebel that doesn't give up.  During that same trip, I had a philosophical breakthrough on many topics of great depth, and I tape recorded much of what I had to say, which I later transferred onto a computer document.  Towards the late part of that trip, I lost the ability to speak and had to write down the rest of my thoughts in a journal.  Within the space of less than half of the journal, I basically wrote a clear and concise view of how life really is.  I plan to expand upon and publish these thoughts one day.  <br>
<br>
The DXM FAQ gives very good descriptions of the effects that one can expect from different plateaus of tripping on DXM, and it also provides a very reliable overview of DXM, what it does, and its potential benefits and dangers.<br>
     <br>
Now that I've summarized a bit, let's jump to my current experiences.  I now take 2.7 mg DXM/kg as an initial dose since I have been using DXM for quite some time (this amounts to approximately eighteen 5 mL doses of Robitussin Maximum Strength Cough or four and a half capfuls for someone weighing 215 lbs.).  Although I have had periods of using with greater and lesser frequency than this, I try not to use DXM more than once a month.  The DXM FAQ advises not to use DMM at lower plateaus more than once or twice a month, and I think this is sound advice.  Too much of any mind-altering substance (alcohol included for those that instantly think illegal drugs here) is not good.    <br>
<br>
Anyway, sometimes I stick with just the intitial dose and sometimes I take a bit more.  Either way, I always have a blast on DXM.  This is where I must intercede: Although I always have a blast on DXM, no one else that I have ever tripped with has had as good of a time or found as much benefit as I have (in excess of 15 people, males and females).  Most people I know do not like DXM very much, and most of the ones that do just see it as a cheap high, not a truly awesome experience.  Having said that, DXM tops my list of favorite substances along with MDMA (Ecstasy).  Both of them tend to bring out creativity in me, although in different ways.  <br>
<br>
Also, as a slight side note, some tabs sold as MDMA (ecstasy) are in fact DXM; I know because I'm experienced with both and can tell them apart.  I've had fun on DXM tabs because I enjoy taking DXM, but I've seen several people who were expecting MDMA have bad experiences on DXM tabs.  The point of this tangent is that I am careful of street 'Ecstasy' actually having DXM in it instead of MDMA (true Ecstasy).  <br>
<br>
Getting back to my DXM experiences, I usually take an initial dose of 4 1/2 capfuls of Robitussin Maximum Strength Cough.  I take this with lots of water and salty crackers to offset nausea caused by too much syrupy sweetness.  I may get nauseated, but I usually don't throw up anymore.  I start feeling woozy after about 45 minutes, and DXM takes full effect by about 2 hours later.  I drive very well on DXM.  <FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</FONT> I become very objective and attuned to details.  I can practically read others minds by observing their body language and mannerisms.  Getting a head rush is common for me, although this was stronger when I hadn't used DXM as many times as I have.  This head rush combined with being very talkative and open about things reminds me of rolling on MDMA (Ecstasy).<br>
<br>
Okay, back to what DXM does to me.  It brings out the devil in me.  Although I am naturally determined and have a high self esteem, my feelings of determination and belief in myself are amplified.  I feel very energetic and spirited, basically unstoppable.  I am able to approach things from many perspectives, 'to see outside of the box.'  My philosophical creativity is often heightened, and my ability to analyze seems to increase.  Emotional barriers that normally keep me from certain conclusions fade away, and use of DXM has helped me to see things more clearly altogether, devoid of dogma, traditional thought, and emotional filtering.  DXM is somewhat of a truth serum for me in that respect.  It has also helped to rejuvenate feelings of determination and belief in myself at times.  Whereas I have written several poems while rolling on MDMA (artistic), I tend to write philosophy or scientific discourse on DXM (analytical).  I am naturally a very deep and emotional person, and I normally write poetry, philosophy, and thoughts on difficult topics.  <br>
<br>
More on DXM...I can dance all night and day on it.  It powers me up about as much as MDMA.  DXM takes my hunger away completely, much like MDMA.  DXM can give me that feeling of being 'outside of myself.'  I sometimes feel like I'm on the outside of everything and am looking in; I think this is part of why DXM makes me very objective and observant of detail.  Vision can sometimes come in frames, and this effect is especially apparent when looking at a fan in motion; I will not see the stream of motion caused by the spinning fan but will instead see only choppy frames of the fan as it passes in different positions.  <br>
<br>
I generally feel very good the next day and the week after use and have no hangover, but this is after a full night of rest (7-8 hours).  Even though I'm not really hungry, I usually drink nutritional supplements in order to keep nutrients in my system as I trip and the next day after.  I have taken both MDMA and DXM while on Effexor.  I have had no negative effects as a result of this. Well, that's it for me folks.  Laterz.<!--   End Body   -->

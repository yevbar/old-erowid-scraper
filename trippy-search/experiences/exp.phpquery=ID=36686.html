<!--   Start Body   -->


Setting: Club, good music, good friends<BR>
Substances already present in the body: Cannabis<BR>
<BR>
02.45am<BR>
Took the pill on an empty stomach. Was feeling quite under the influence of cannabis, to the point where standing up was not an option.<BR>
<BR>
03.05am<BR>
Felt fidgety and nervous. Whether this was the onset or just me wondering what I'd just done is difficult to decide. I think in restrospect it was mainly the latter.<BR>
<BR>
03.15am<BR>
Extreme dialation of pupils was observed, (from about 4mm to about 10mm). Was no longer fidgety. All 'stoned' feelings had completely disappeared, replaced by a sudden energy.<BR>
<BR>
03.20am<BR>
I danced...and danced...and danced. Felt about 500% in myself. Felt under the influence, yet clear-headed at the same time. Vision was effected such that focusing on close objects was near-impossible without one eye shut. Vision at distance seemed improved, objects at distance appeared 'sharper'. Lots of trailing of lights and severe eye-wiggling (but whether you count that as good or bad is subjective). <BR>
<BR>
04.00am<BR>
Left the club. Embarked upon a 50 minute journey home by car (I wasn't driving). Enormous feeling of well-being, a feeling of connection to people like nothing ever experienced before. Had a dance music CD on; it was like I was appreciating music on another level, subtle changes in the music's rhythm seemed very apparent and noticeable (variations of drum patterns etc). <BR>
My thoughts were rapidly changing. The only way I can think of describing the feeling is that I couldn't think in a straight line. Was very easily distracted by the morning sun, and by how it appeared such a deep orange colour. My companions (who had not taken anything) told me that it looked no different to normal.<BR>
<BR>
05.00am<BR>
Arrived home. Chilled in the living room with a few joints and some more music. Felt a bit self-conscious in some respects as I was the only one 'out there.' Was chatty relative to normal standards though; felt more at ease talking to my friends than I normally would have.<BR>
<BR>
06.30am<BR>
Still felt very awake, but went to bed anyway, don't recall any particular trouble sleeping.<BR>
<BR>
02.30pm<BR>
Awoke. Didn't laze in bed, but got up feeling like I'd had an amazing night's sleep. Was happy to spend the afternoon just mooching around the house, was still feeling a bit like i was in my own little world.<BR>
<BR>
It was a truly amazing experience.<BR>
<BR>
My advice to people wanting to try it. Do so, with sober friends to keep an eye on you, and a couple of friends who want to do it too. My second experience I was with friends who were also on it, and it makes for an incredible evening.<BR>
<BR>
I did not experience any comedown on this first time. In fact, I continued to feel quite 'up' for over a week afterwards. Clearly this effect was psychological, rather than physiological.<BR>
<BR>
MDMA is a powerful substance that has changed my life, I feel, for the better.<!--   End Body   -->

<!--   Start Body   -->


I have never done any psychoactive compounds before, mostly just an occasional beer or some marijuana every once in a while, but I soon got to reading about HBWR seeds and became a little curious. I decided on purchasing some ‘Hawaiian’ variety which they said were ‘potent!’ The 25 seeds came in the mail and I separated 13 seeds and began to clean them. First I scraped of the seed coat, then the fuzzy layer as best as I could (That contains the stuff that breaks down into cyanide in your body and some people say it what causes the most nausea).<BR>
<BR>
I ground the seeds in a coffee grinder and set them in some distilled water (I’ve heard that tap water that has chlorine in it can break down the LSA molecules) and a bit of ginger to help relieve nausea. I let that sit in a dark place for 24 hours, stirring occasionally. I ate a bowl of Cheerios for breakfast, no lunch and no dinner, but I’d have some water throughout the day.  At 4 pm the next day I took one Dramamine, then at 5:00 I drank the odd tasting mixture slowly, including the seed remnants. It didn’t taste bad, but it definitely was a bit bitter and plant like.<BR>
<BR>
After I drank it I went to my friends house, A, who was there with his girlfriend B. At about 5:30, I noticed that I would seem to stare at ordinary things for a while for no apparent reason and start thinking about them, like how they work or how have I used them before. It was almost like a very low marijuana thought rush. A said that my pupils seemed to be a bit big, but not really that big yet. I proceeded to drink some old flat sprite which seem to quell the slight nausea pangs that I had. They weren’t severe, but it seemed like I could feel a small rock of something in my stomach.<BR>
<BR>
By 6 I could definitely feel something. I would stare at something and the outer edges of my vision seemed to swirl around it, not really a lot, but I could tell. My pupils were getting very big by now, noticeably big B said. Another of our friends came over now, called C. We all got into A’s car at that point and went to a CD store, which was about 45 minutes away cause C had to trade in some of his old CD’s. When we got in the car something definitely hit me, I was in the back seat and the street lights were casting shadows on the seat back in front of me.<BR>
<BR>
It seemed like the shadows were a play of my life, including the future. I saw myself graduate, get married, have kids and so on, and I felt very happy and relaxed, as everything I saw was good. I didn’t feel any panic or anxiety rush that a lot of people say they experience on psychedelics the first item they use them. We soon passed onto the highway and all the lights, street and car, turned into octopuses of energy (That’s the best way I can describe it). Each light seemed to have its own personal pattern of tentacles, some were long and stringy, others short and fat.<BR>
<BR>
By 6:30, I could feel the vasoconstriction effect of the other alkaloids kicking in. My skin was a bit dry and my legs felt tingly and heavy, like a very large buildup of lactic acid after running for a while. I took my shoe of and B said my foot was pale, but not blue or anything I should be worried about yet. (I did this throughout the night and each time it was fine.)<BR>
<BR>
At around 7:00 we got to the store. Between 7:00 and 7:30 was what I call the bad part of the trip. My eyes were jumping out of their sockets and I had no iris left. I guess it’s true what they say about ‘eyes like piss holes in the snow.’ It hurt to walk yet I felt it necessary to pace around the store looking at nothing. I seemed to be outside of the store’s reality, a ghost simply observing human life. The nausea had grown steadily, and it seemed like the world that was beyond ten feet from me started to twist into a spiral. I would see passing shapes whenever I blinked. They would either be one of two things: A blue diamond with a triangle in each corner or a five by five row of green star-like objects. Suddenly, intense paranoia and fear crept up on me from out of nowhere. I had to get out of there, so I went outside and puked up the seed mess. (Not a good idea to do in the crowded parking lot of a strip mall type deal.) After this I regained my composure, cleaned my mouth out with some water, and went back in.<BR>
<BR>
At 7:30 it seemed like a door had opened somewhere and I could feel something better then happiness and contentment together. Everything was bright and colorful, and I could mold reality into things its not. I looked at my face in the mirror and I could make myself look old or young at will. On the ride home I saw in almost a deep meditative state thinking about everything in my life that I had done and how I should go on. The pain in my legs was severe, but it didn’t matter. The car headlight were giving me some nice streaks to look at too.<BR>
<BR>
At 8:00 we were back in A’s house. He has this carpet with rows of stars on them and I was completely mesmerized by how I could manipulate them. I would focus on the start, then lose focus and focus on something that seemed not to be there and the start would start spinning. The walls, covered by magazine cutouts and band posters, turned almost to a thick liquid, and colors started running together. This is about the peak I believe. At some point during my trance at the carpet and walls some weird feeling came to me, something completely new that I had never felt before. I can’t really describe it but its almost a transcendent feeling, and everything felt exactly as it should.<BR>
<BR>
At 8:30 I left A’s house with C and we met up with D and E, who were driving around looking for something to do. It was then I noticed how bright everything was. It almost seemed to have gotten brighter since I left A’s house, after it was already dark. C said they could drink at his house, so we found F, who had a carload of people who we gave money to and went to try and get beer. While they were doing that I had an incredible craving for food so we went to Wendy’s. Me and D went in to get the food and I realized how bad I still was. The walls were like curtains and would sway back and forth. It seemed like everything that had a normal geometry to it turned into some moving breathing entity. The corridor to the bathroom which was actually only five feet long seemed more like fifty and twisted down to a ‘very’ tiny door.<BR>
<BR>
At 9:00 we were driving around still, and I was perfectly content eating my five chicken nuggets. They seem to taste perfect, and each time I took a bite I was happy, like a kid who is given a piece of candy for a good job. As D drove around, I continued to think and became very happy and serene. We found out they couldn’t get the beer so I went home and laid on my bed till about 12:00 just looking at my ‘white’ walls which were covered by overlays of intricate blue designs. I thought about everything and seem to come to a realization about everything I thought about. I can’t imagine a time when I was more content then that. I felt like I had been given some sort of knowledge that no one else knew and it was my job to make sure that I used what I learned to better my life. <BR>
<BR>
I had some of the most lucid dreams that night too. I could control what I did and interact how I wanted to, and I realized it was a dream too. When I woke up, I could still see some faint overlays on my wall, and If I stared hard enough I could distort the edged of my vision. Apart from my legs feeling as if they were thirty pounds heavier, I had no ill effects. In fact, I feel relaxed and happy, and completely content. I think I am still going to wait about a month of so to use the rest of the seeds, or till I can get some actual LSD that I won’t have to throw back up.<!--   End Body   -->

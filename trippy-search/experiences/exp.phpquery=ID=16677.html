I had read all of the catnip reports, and finally decided to try some.  A friend and I went to the grocery store and bought a bag of catnip and a can of the least expensive cat food (so it would look like we had a cat, which probably didn't work, but oh well).  I took the stuff home and kept it until I got three other people to try it out with me.<BR>
<BR>
We went back to a clearing in the woods, and the experienced pot user of the group began to make some catnip joints (we called them garfields).  I finished one off, and felt nothing but a bad taste in my throat and mouth.  Thinking that I hadn't smoked enough, I had my friend make two more for me.  By now the taste was horrible, but I finished them off.  <BR>
<BR>
I looked around, and the only effects I noticed were that I had less peripheral vision, and my friends red shirt seemed much brighter.  I thought I was imagining both though.  We had all smoked about as much as we could, so we walked deeper into the woods.  I felt something, very small, although I can't quite put my finger on what it was.  <BR>
<BR>
I got the bright idea of hyperventilating myself, and it was actually quite cool.  it only took like 10 deep breaths, and it made me feel light headed and confused for about 15 seconds at a time.  Not long after this, the small 'something' was gone, and everyone else said they were 'coming down'.  Through the whole thing, they said they felt a slight buzz, and I thought they were faking or imagining it, because I felt nothing.  <BR>
<BR>
Even my friends who claimed to feel something said it wasn't worth it.<!--   End Body   -->

At about 10:30 pm, my two friends and I obtained a ten-strip of what was called 'acid'--a bad mistake, as we later found out that this was DOI. When my dealer originally called me and told me that he took 'four' and tripped for 36 hours I called bullshit. There is no WAY a drug can last that long, I said, especially not acid, which I had done before.<BR>
<BR>
I was sadly wrong.<BR>
<BR>
We consumed the doses around 11:00 pm in the evening at my friend's cabin in the mountains. This was a very safe place, as there were no parents, cops, neighbors, etc., just the pristine beauty of the mountains. To begin we all ate just one hit, understandably, as a 'test' dose. My dealer recommended we wait two hours before taking another hit to see if we would be able to handle it. Our first mistake was getting bored with the slow come-up and deciding to take two and a half (each) more hits at the 1:15 mark. <BR>
<BR>
I'd like to describe this drug as something like acid, but rather then a mind 'fuck' it is more of a mind 'melt'. My vision, thoughts, emotions, change to a sort of fluid that ripples and waves back and forth, just like the nature of the trip itself. In fact, the drug almost felt like waves; the DOI would come in, crash upon me, then recede, then crash, then recede, then crash, then recede, on and on and on and on. <BR>
<BR>
At about the three-four hour mark my memory becomes relatively confused. I feel like the second and third doses kicked in about here, leading to a +++ at the 'crash' stage and a ++ at the receding stage. Colors, especially oranges and reds, became intensified, beautiful, and shifted in a helix-like pattern. Everything seemed to spiral up, producing more feelings of the wave-like patterns. This stage of the trip was very enjoyable for my friends and I, we watched a movie (The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou), played ping pong, and sat on the back porch of the cabin staring at the spiral moon. <BR>
<BR>
The hours began to gradually meld together, as 3:00 am became 5:00, 5:00 became 7:00, etc., until we knew that this drug was not going to leave hold of our minds at any time soon. The ++ to +++ 'crashing' effect was still completely present, and there was no sign of a comedown or any other exiting of the trip. At this point I called my dealer, fairly frightened, asking what time this would be over. He gave me the time of 5:00 pm, telling me that this was not really 'acid', but the designer drug 'DOI', like acid but much longer lasting. <BR>
<BR>
Having heard this time (5:00) straight from the horse's mouth, I proceeded to hunker down in a comfortable position, focus on positive energy, and 'power-trip' for the next several (3-5) hours. One friend of mine had a very difficult time believing that the drug would last that long, and started to become almost hysterical, bordering on the edge of tears. 'When is it going to end?! I've gone completely insane, and it's never, ever going to change!' He would moan, and it took me and my other friend constant effort to keep him calm. <BR>
<BR>
2:00 in the afternoon hit, all of us still maintaining this difficult, +++ to ++ 'wave' effect, and I realised that, though we needed to get out of the cabin, there was no WAY any of us were going to drive out of it. One friend of mine called his girlfriend, and she proceeded to drive up to the cabin with one of her friends. I praise the dear lord for these girls, they arrived as the 'freakout' friend was seriously contemplating 'ending' the trip, through whatever means neccessary. To describe all the shifting color patterns at this time would be unneccessary, as all I can say is that the sunrise was unbelievable--the orange, red, and pink was all accentuated with the glow of frost, waving and changing right before my eyes. The waving pattern continued all day, into the early evening, when I decided it was time for me to go home, as I had to attend a Christmas party for my church. This was at about 5:00 pm, the target comedown time, so I hoped that I would be alright. Once again, this was completely wrong, and as I took a shower to get prepared for talking to parents, their co-workers, and church friends, I knew this was going to be one of the most difficult experiences of my life. <BR>
<BR>
As we left the cabin, 'Freakout' was still freaking-out, telling how he would not be able to handle the real world, and that all he wanted was to go back and stay in the cabin, but then he didn't want to stay in the cabin alone, so he was forced to come with us.  My other friend's girlfriend proceeded to drive B and T home, while her friend took me to the christmas party. <BR>
<BR>
I came inside, still ++ and 'crashing', and felt that my parents knew immediately that something was wrong, but I attributed it to being extremely tired after staying up all night and then day hiking a 5 mile trail. This seemed to work well, but my constant pupil dilation might have made them suspicious, as my pupils would go from tiny to very large once every five seconds. I kept trucking on through the night, 8:00, 9, 10, not seeing any signs of a comedown or a way out, though probably not experiencing a full ++, but more like a + and a half. At 10:30, all the guests left and I headed straight to bed, trying to avoid all parental questions and hoping for just some small bit of sleep. Surprisingly, I fell asleep almost immediately, as I guess my body was just so exhausted from the now 24 straight hours of tripping.<BR>
<BR>
I woke up and looked around at my room--any movement? No. Praise God, there was absolutely no spirals, curves, waves, or anything, besides a very gentle feeling of the drug in the back of my mind. I was ecstatic that I had finally came down, and hoped that I didn't fuck up my relationship with my parents or any of my friends, and swore off drugs for a good deal of time.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, I, and my friends, were not prepared for the LENGTH of this drug. I was able to handle the lack of sleep psychedelic effects, but the 24 hour trip was pure madness. Although I managed to keep a positive attitude and focus for the majority of the trip, some points I felt utter despair, a feeling that I was completely insane, and that I would have to live like this for the rest of my life. This was quite a drug, and not one that I will experiment with any time soon. In fact, I feel like flushing the other four hits down the toilet right now, so that no one else has to go through the same things that my friends and I went through, at least from me. Honestly, we were poorly prepared for this drug, and it gave us a royal ass kicking. It was one long roller coaster ride.<!--   End Body   -->

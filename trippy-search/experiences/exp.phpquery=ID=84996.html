In this trip, I dosed up on 20 mg of 2C-I and then proceed to smoke JWH-018 for the first time. This combination led to a VERY interesting trip. The trip was definitely different from my previous trips with 2C-I and 2C-I/weed, and I attribute this to the effects of JWH-018. <br>
<br>
I found myself in a ridiculous position, the only one in the room who was tripping. I was losing my mind much more than in my previous 2C-I trips. I found it hard to concentrate on anything. As we were watching a movie, all I wanted to do was either melt into the floor or hug someone. I saw swirling effects. Everything I looked at seemed to be moving from within, like something underneath the surface was moving around. These visuals were very apparent and clear. <br>
<br>
At one point we looked at one of those optical illusions on the internet--the kind that you stare at for a long time, then look away and see the wall moving. Well. I was already seeing that shit anyway. And I can say that if you're already having visuals on 2C-I, TRY LOOKING AT OPTICAL ILLUSIONS, it's amazing. When I looked away at the ceiling, it swirled into itself like a slow whirlpool.<br>
<br>
The interesting part of the trip came when the cops showed up. I noticed out of the window some flashing lights and a cop parked outside of our apartment. Luckily they weren't there for us and were simply closing the gate as they do every night. But holy shit... it scared me a lot. For 6 hours after that my heart wouldn't stop racing. The initial rush of quickly hiding the stashes of our various drugs had boosted me up into an all-new headspace. My trip had been transformed into something very strange. I couldn't stay there. I got the hell out of there. I walked really fast over to a friend's apartment.<br>
<br>
When I got there I found myself with absolutely nothing to say. I felt completely out of place. My emotions were becoming irrational. Everything that came out of my mouth had the wrong inflection; when I said something it sounded like I was upset, even though the words themselves were not out of the ordinary. I was never able to get out of this, and ended up having a pretty awkward evening at my friend's apartment.<br>
<br>
When I got back home I couldn't sleep. I was too busy being paranoid and crying. I didn't understand any of it. The night had been insane. Since then I've tried JWH-018 by itself and haven't had the same paranoia. I want to caution everyone to remember their setting when combining 2C-I and JWH-018. It seems to me that the combination can definitely lead to a great and unique kind of trip, but it may be a little hard to retain your composure. But I'm willing to try the combination again.<!--   End Body   -->

This is a true story about my friend who I witnessed go through the most intense trip you can have on these mushrooms without dieing or going to a hospital, here is a time line of the events, the times will be pretty close to the actual time of the events.<BR>
 <BR>
2:30am-sitting in a room filled with 8 people my friend starts to eat 8gms of dried amanita mushroom with wild cherry pepsi, grams are weighed using a very good digital scale. <BR>
3:10am-friend eats 7 more grams of dried mushrooms with mountain dew soda, also eats cookies. <BR>
3:30am-friend starts to experience upset stomach but not nausea, he runs to the bathroom but has shit in his pants. After going to the bathroom he comes outside were everyone is smoking dried mushrooms with opium, I think he took 1-2 hits.  He is begining to notice the effects. He is getting bursts of energy and begins to dance, he looks up at a passing plane in the sky with blinking lights and says whoa thats awesome<BR>
<BR>
4:00am-this is when my friend starts to go crazy. We r all back in the room. Everyone is fucking with him now because he cannot put any words together to make a sentence. He says repeated words then says wow at the end of the statement. It gets worse, he starts to express diferent emotions first happy then crying and sits in the closet. He is talking about the devil and god alot. Everyone is fucking with him now because they cant believe he is this fucked up. Someone pushes him and he punches them in the face. Someone punches him in the face and he does not move or feel it. <BR>
4:45am-friend runs out of the room into the living room where he says where is the shower and removes all of his clothes and is naked, he pisses on the rug<BR>
5:00-he is chasing people naked and does not look in control of his body. I am not seeing everything going on cuz I am laying on the bed fucked up myself from something else. He is chasing people naked and seeing things<BR>
5:30-the person's whos house we are at mom wakes up for work and says what the fuck is going on  is he drunk, my friend starts to say things like I'm on drugs help me, call the cops I'm dieing. She thinks he is drunk and goes to work<BR>
<BR>
6:00-its getting worse for him. He goes outside with two kids who r trying to help him by giving him water to drink so he can throw up. He keeps sticking his fingers real deep down his throat to puke. He starts to drag himself on the dirt then lays across the bbq grill. <BR>
6:30-they bring him inside and help him on the bed where he lays down. Everyone leaves the room but me and another kid sleeping on the floor. Out of nowhere he sits up and pukes out so much shit its like the movies. It goes all over the wall and then onto the kid sleeping on the floor face. He runs out of the room saying what the fuck. My friend gets down from the bed where I help him out. He looks pretty bad still. Cannot talk right and says things like my right eye is god and my left is the devil. He says I got to puke so I bring him to the bathroom. I'm in there with him and another kid. He cannot stop trembling and is having bad muscle twitching. The thing that freaked me out is that his wrists were ice cold. I had my other friend feel to confirm this and he said holy shit. He did not know where he was. We put a sweatshirt on him because he had no shirt on. He knew the name of one kid who asked him to tell him who he was but then he said the other kid was god. <BR>
<BR>
I brought him back into the room. He kept trembling bad, his face was real white his lips were white  his wrists were ice cold. He kept saying he was going to die  and that the devil wants him to go to sleep. He says I have to puke or something  I help him remove his sweatshirt then he proceeds to take off his pants and get naked. I'm holding a bag up to his face while he is naked holding him because it looks like he is slipping in and out of consciousness like maximus in the movie gladiator. His eyes r rolling to the back of his head. He pukes mushroom colored liquid into the bag<BR>
8:00-still fucked up he lays down till 9:00 wakes up and is still fucked up  goes back to sleep till 10:20 he is starting to act normal and can talk right but still is fucked up because he wants to take a bath and I help him to it but he is stumbling around like he is drunk but seems alright. I sit in the bathroom with him to make sure he is alright taking a bath>he goes back to the room to lay down and starts to tell me some shit that happened to him>he said the room was all white<he was playing basketball with god<jesus and the holy ghost. The devil was telling him to go to sleep but god was telling him to puke>god asked do you want to stay or go, he remembers certain things but not most. He said god told him to never do drugs again. <BR>
<BR>
We let him go back to sleep after questioning him about this shit. He sleeps from 11am to 6pm  wakes up and is fine. . . . This was a fucking intense trip for him and one he did not want to take because he did not know the power of these mushrooms.  I suggest not taking over 10gms of the red muscaria mushroom at a time unless you have experienced people by your side. The shit can start to get insane<!--   End Body   -->

On a summer afternoon, a day or 2 after a toil with ecstasy which had me using about 20 or so pills ( yes 20 or so pills )I decided to smoke some weed to make the stomach cramps go away because I get extreme cramps after doing a lot of ecstasy.  I was also experiencing a lot of body cramps from over exertion.  So anyway, I smoked the buds on my kitchen counter with a keychain mini bowl my friend got from a convenience store.  it was perfect.  I started feeling pretty high within the first 20 minutes but all of a sudden things got really odd and creepy.  I concluded that the reason everything was getting so damn visually weird was because when you do a high dose of ecstasy, its like the minimal after effects of acid, like things are still moving around a little but its not considered tripping.<BR>
<BR>
Well, once the weed started to really kick in, it was as if I took about 4 hits of good acid.  I couldn't believe what was happening, I was just looking at everything melt off my field of vision.  Everything was all wavy and it was like I was looking at heat wave distortion.  A friend had called and asked if I wanted to go to the mall with her so I said yeah of course cuz I thought it would be cool to go to the mall tripping the balls I was definitely tripping.  I went into the bathroom to mess with my hair and I looked in the mirror. wow was that the biggest mistake I ever made.  I think it took me about 5 minutes to figure out who it was in the mirror.  I knew it was me, but I looked so much different than usual.  It was as if I never seen myself before and I was looking for the first time.  I started blurting out things to myself in the mirror like wow you're fuckin ugly, do you act Italian, and wondering how anyone would ever want to look at me.  I started to get really scared just looking at myself seeing every little thing that makes up my personality.  I was getting visions of my true self and seeing exactly what I really was.  IT SCARED ME!! I don't look at myself the same anymore!! I never went out with my friend that day because I ended up standing in my bathroom for a few hours. Unless you wanna see what you really are, don't look at yourself in the mirror!<!--   End Body   -->

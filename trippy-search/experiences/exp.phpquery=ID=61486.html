Well, I read about Voacanga africana containing similar chemicals as ibogaine, and thought it would be fun to get fucked up on it. I purchased both the seeds and the rootbark.<br>
<br>
This stuff is seriously weird. It contains several chemicals with dissimilar effects. Several hours after the seeds have been chewed (not swallowed whole) I felt a strong sense of lethargy and sleepyness. I came up with this dose after some not terribly cautious experimentation. I would actually suggest setting an alarm for an hour later, as a different chemical/chemicals take effect. This is where things become interesting.<br>
<br>
Music began to sound very good. The electronica, of which I'd lately become bored, became interesting and fresh again. In between the songs, I discovered that I could make out what my neighbors were saying. The supplier claimed that some indiginous people somewhere used it for hunting. I believe this to not be because of it's stimulant properties, but rather because hearing becomes much much more acute. I was also struck by the realization that my neighbor's conversations were incredibly inane. Think - apartment chemical druggy warfare!<br>
<br>
These seeds also had a very strange effect on my spacial perception. It appeared to make things more 3d, in an impossible to explain way. I normally have a disorder which interfears with spacial perception (Gertsman's Developmental Syndrome or something like that). I noticed for the first time on my favorite 1st person shootemup game, that one of the levels was not quite physically possible. Bizarre.<br>
<br>
Along with my increased sense of space, came interesting mathmatical effects. I discovered, while attempting to up the dose, that I was completely unable to count above 30something. After 30something I would inevitably be unable to continue. This provided me with much amusement (Dude! I can't count! AWESOME!).<br>
<br>
The head space was fairly similar to other hallucinogens I have done - but somewhat less disorienting than say, equivalently strong doses of acid. Lastly the visuals were not terribly prominent. There was a bright sparkly texture to the air, slight swirlyness of vision, and such. For much more interesting visuals, I take a benzo (like ativan).<br>
<br>
Oh yes, this stuff contains ibogaine, and perhaps has antiaddictive properties? I have come to the conclusion that this, and most likely the iboga plant, is a placebo in that regard. At best it may cause mild, temporary remission of withdrawl symptoms (in this case nicotine).<!--   End Body   -->

This experience was a huge wake up call for me.  I hope all of you who read this can learn from my near fatal mistake.  <br>
<br>
My friends and I like to go out to dance clubs and occasionally take drugs.  While my friends and I were making plans for the night I asked them all if they were going to be getting any drugs.   Everyone said they were all just going to drink, so I figured it would be a night of alcohol only.  Fine with me. Since I was short on cash, I decided I would get a cheaper start to the night and drink before I got to the club downtown to avoid the expensive prices.  I had 2 glasses while I was getting ready and split one more cup with a friend in the car on the way down there. (I know...not smart) I wasn't driving and I was with 2 of my girlfriends, my boyfriend and his best friend all in the same car.  <br>
<br>
About 11:00pm  which was an hour after we had arrived, my boyfriend and his best friend approached me and said for me to follow then to the unisex bathrooms.  I thought, 'Alright...they have drugs'  And sure enough they pulled out a small bottle of GHB.  I only had one vodka and redbull and was nursing a cape cod so I thought, why not?  We all took a small capfull and went out to dance.  <br>
<br>
For the next 30 minutes or so I had a great time.  I was dancing and I could tell I was really out of it.  I was dizzy and  lightheaded, but I had taken GHB before so I was expecting it.  But that's when everything changed.  I have no memory of what happened next AT ALL.  The only reason I can tell you this is because I was with several friends who saw everything.  <br>
<br>
Apparently, after I'd been out on the dance floor I went to the bathroom again around midnight with one of my girlfriends and took another capfull and she took one.  I then waited for her to use the bathroom and when she was finished I grabbed her and started kissing her. (I am in a serious committed relationship with my boyfriend of a year.  I love him with all my heart, so this was not normal for me.)<br>
<br>
After we stopped kissing in the stall, we went back out to the dance floor with everyone else.  I'm still fuzzy on the details because I've gotten mixed stories from different friends but some say I went to the bar and they were buying all of us shots. (Of what, I have no idea)  However, a few friends told me that I wasn't taking any shots with them, I was just leaning against the railing while they were taking them...who knows.<br>
<br>
After that I was told I was dancing for a while longer and then I was leaning over the rail around the dance floor.  My boyfriend said he began to scratch my back slowly asking if I was ok.  He said, I stood up and looked at him with my eyes rolling back in my head and just stared at him blankly.  He assumed I was fine...just messed up on GHB and began dancing only to turn around immediately after that and see me and his best friend kissing and leaning against the railing.  THIS is totally unnatural for me.  I am in no way interested in his best friend...I would NEVER have done that.  My boyfriend got angry and went upstairs and about 15 minutes later one of our other friends came up to get him and told him I was passed out outside and coughing up blood.  He said (still pretty mad) 'How can she be passed out AND coughing up blood?'  And our friend told him it was serious and he really needed to get down there.  I still don't know if I was really coughing up blood...some say I was and some say I wasn't. (???)  <br>
<br>
He went outside and I was already strapped in an ambulance with a 16 gauge IV in my arm, oxygen mask on, and totally unconscious. This all happened right at 1 am. (Just 15 to 20 minutes before I was kissing his best friend on the dance floor...??)  My boyfriend went with me to the hospital in the ambulance and I almost flatlined on the way. Luckily they were able to flush enough fluids into me and get oxygen into my lungs and I am fine, but imagine how scared and shocked I was when I woke up 4 hours later in a hospital room strapped down with an IV and people asking me if I knew where I was.  At first I was telling them I was at the club.  I thought, what a crazy question...of course I know where I am...but I couldn't figure it out.  <br>
<br>
I had taken two capfulls of GHB in two hours before and had a great time.  I have even taken two capfulls along with a few drinks and been fine.  It was just that either this GHB was stronger or maybe I had too much alcohol.  There is really no way to determine a safe combination of the two.  Regardless...it was an almost deadly combination.  I will never take GHB again.  Not only because it's dangerous but because of the things I did while on it that I NEVER would have done under ANY other circumstances. <br>
<br>
After it was all over I was very tired and dehydrated.  I was severely depressed for two days and didn't want to return any of my friends phone calls or see anyone.  I was sick to my stomach.  My boyfriend forgave me but I felt horrible when I was told what I'd done...although I don't remember one second of kissing either of them, and I have a HUGE hospital bill I'm still paying on. BUT the worst part was the soreness in my legs and back, and bruising all over my back and elbows.  I could hardly sit, lie down, or walk up the stairs and was in pain for a couple of weeks.  <br>
<br>
I later found out that the club bouncers had carried me outside and dropped me on my back on the concrete, unconscious.  This explained some of the soreness and extreme bruising on my back.  And in the few days following that night I began to have flashes of things that may or may not have happened that night.  One flash that occurred to me while I was almost asleep one night was of me leaning backwards over the railing, someone leaning on top of me, and the railing digging into my back.  I don't know if this was something that happened or if I was just staring to dream.  I guess I'll never know the full details of the night I almost died.<!--   End Body   -->

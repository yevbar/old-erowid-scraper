The beginning of summer in 2000, memorial day weekend to be exact, I consciously left my body on journey of an alternative reality.  My setting was a music festival in California.  I thought I was injesting 10-20 hits of good liquid LSD.  I find out later I got a 'Chunk' in the last of the bottle.  A tiny little Crystal of LSD.<BR>
<BR>
I really don't think I was in the appropriate setting for this type of extensive interfacing but there I was.  In the Moment.  Past Present and Future lined up into one and created a lattice work of moving eternity so I jumped on.  I went through many synchronicities lining up people in my life events coming into place.  At one point in the reality I was in I Birthed universes for the future or past or the infinte.  Time has a funny way of bending and contorting in this altered state.  <BR>
<BR>
The birthing process brought me closer to oneness.  I had a hard time re-entering my body.  Everything turned to ones and zero's and negitive one like on the internet.  I actually felt like The planet had a big net over it and to re-enter I had to go through it.  Very unpleasent in a digital way.  The most interesting thing happened to me after this experience.  My eye color changed for three days.  I have green eyes and after this experience I had bright piercing electric blue eyes.  People around me were commenting as well as my boyfriend.<BR>
<BR>
I have made an explanation to my self about this.  How scientifically sound it is I don't know.  I know lighter eyes let more light in them.  So on my journey I believe I interfaced so much with so much light(truth) that my eye color adapted to that frequency of learning on that level.  As far as set and setting, the universes I birthed there was me pissing my self here, I ended up hanging out with rock med.  I would not trade my experience for ANYTHING.  I also woundn't take such a high dosage of any thing in a festival setting with out someplace to go where you can let it all out if need be.  It is important to have acess to a space on this demension that can haddle your body mimicking what is going on in other demensions you may be traveling. I use this and all other alternative reality experiences every day to further the study of self. <BR>
<BR>
It is funny how one experience can impact you so intensely that it is still teaching you in a year.  This memorial day weekend I attended MINDSTATES2.<!--   End Body   -->

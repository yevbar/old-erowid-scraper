The first time I tried coke I was really nervous. I knew I had an addictive personality, and I knew I was depressed and mentally unstable, but at this point in my life I felt like I had nothing to lose. My friend was very experienced with coke, and when I went over to her house, I watched her do it. She did a line or 2 and seemed pretty normal to me. She then set up a line for me, to which I reluctantly obliged. It felt great. I remember saying 'I bet this is how normal people feel' over and over again. I felt happy, carefree, and safe for the first time in years.<br>
<br>
However, all I wanted even after only 2 lines was more. I had to slap myself back to reality and reason with myself that this feeling is from a somewhat dangerous drug. The next time she came over, I was so excited to do more blow. Except we did way too much, and considering I had zero tolerance and she had built up one over time, I got kinda sick. I did 6 lines basically in a row, and after a bit a wave of what felt like car sickness and an intense fever struck me. And yet, I still felt amazing. This was a surreal feeling: knowing that I feel sick and yet being completely content. <br>
<br>
I'm glad I had both of these experiences because it has made me realize that I need to have control over myself and that this drug can take over if not carefully monitored.<!--   End Body   -->

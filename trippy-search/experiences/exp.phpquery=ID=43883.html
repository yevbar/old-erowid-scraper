I had received 5 2mg Hydromorphone pills earlier that day from a friend of mine whom it is prescribed to for jaw pain. I bought them for 15 dollars total. (an outrageously sweet price, I know). Later that day I went to a friend’s house where I hung out with several of my non-using friends. I had a pretty good time. With that, and the security of knowing I would get smacked out later that night, I was in a pretty good mind set.<br>
<br>
When I got home later in the night, and waited an hour or two for my parents to go to sleep, I crushed up the five pills underneath my ID, with a screw driver, and the chopped it finely with a razor. I had divided the pile into a dozen or so small lines. With past experience I've found that large lines, snorted too quickly will block my nasal passage, therefore not allowing it to take its intended course and drip down, and blocking the other portion of my powder to not make it past as well, which creates a snowball effect. After a couple of minutes, I successfully insufflated the entire pile completely, and had no problems, therefore all 10 milligrams got into my system.<br>
<br>
I went to my living room with the big T.V. and started watching Jay Leno, not by choice, but because Conan O'Brian wasn't on yet. As the Hydromorphone took effect gradually, yet exponentially I came to establish later, I noticed that Jay Leno was much funnier than usual. When the Hydromorphone was taking a further hold of my mind and body, I began to feel this rush, this sensation traveling all throughout my body. I welcomed this warm, pleasant sensation to reach every part of my body, relieving all tension, pain, and stress that were present beforehand. I was very pleased with this dosage, and I had wanted to voice it, however I was in just too much bliss to do so. I constantly thought to myself during this that I was peaking, only to be submerged even deeper into the opiate ocean. I could never pinpoint where I was peaking and starting to come down, which leads me to believe a line graph of the high would show an exponential increase as the start, and a rounded, not flat plateau. <br>
<br>
When Conan came on, it seemed like everything in the world was right, and just. I hadn't had a cigarette in days, but even that didn't seem to bother me. Laughing at Conan's humor was practically orgasmic. During the plateau of my experience, I distinctly remember totally loosing concern for my surrounding world. It was just me, and Conan O'Brian on T.V. I even became totally focused on the T.V. and everything else became completely dark and irrelevant to me. At this point, I couldn't keep focused on the T.V. any longer, only the severity of my wonderful opiate high. So, I decided to go to bed. <br>
<br>
I managed to get upstairs with surprising ease. Taking steps seemed pleasurable, not just some chore. However, this sensation was very subtle, but I imagine it would be more apparent in higher doses. So, I get into bed, and begin to feel the epitome of comfort. I decide to meditate in my bed, because meditation and opiates is always a good combination. I slowed my breathing to a consistent pace, and focused only on breathing. I found myself in a few minutes unable to feel my body touching my bed or my sheets. I felt as though I was completely floating in midair, like I was in outer-space remaining motionless. <br>
<br>
This was, by far, the best feeling I've ever felt. A meditation trance can easily be broken by thought, which it did, and the effect didn't last as long as I would have wanted it to. Not long after, I had nodded off into an opiate coma. There I had a vivid dream that America had been encompassed completely by nuclear explosions, therefore being totally destroyed, and all the people living there were killed. I remember the ones who caused this to happen said that there would be more land for themselves now, however I explained to them that their logic was flawed since an area decimated by a nuclear explosion would be uninhabitable.<br>
<br>
I was woken up the next morning and had been told I was to do community service that morning (as a part of the terms of my probation). I remember groaning because my neck had a severe cramp in it, and the opiate high had worn off. Arising from my bed I had a strange form of hangover, where I felt unsatisfied, and a little strange. I could describe this as being very slightly drunk and beginning coming down from it. I went to the senior citizen's house and did three total hours of work, which went by surprisingly fast. I threw up in the car ride on the way home, and I had been feeling nauseous all throughout the work time. I got back to my place at around noon, and slept until 4:00 in the afternoon.<!--   End Body   -->

A couple months ago my sweetie and me did 2ct7.  we both did 10mg nasally -- in part to make 20mg go farther, and in part because the very slow come-on of doing it orally sounded, well, very slow.<BR>
<BR>
Within 10 mins of doing it, the effects were strong, and they just got stronger. For about 30 mins we were both incapacitated and uncomfortable.  there were many swirling colors and a strong, odd body-ache.  It seemed best to be lying down, but even that didn't feel too good.  it was very trippy, but there was a strong component of 'oh god, I hope this stops soon'.  there was some nausea; more for me, having just eaten beforehand, and i got sick, about 30-40mins into it.  After that I felt a bit better, and a good friend asked me to go for a walk.  walking around cleared my head a lot.  there was still a fairly overwhelming *woosh* of disorientation and color.  I was kinda stunned.  It was hard to talk or follow what was happening.<BR>
<BR>
After about an hour, it became more pleasant.  The 'too much' feeling passed, leaving a colorful, trippy space.  I still felt pretty unable to interact with people.  I had been planning to add mdma at some point, and other people present had already started on mdma, so I took 100mg mdma around 2 hours into the 2ct7.  By that point, the 2ct7 had definitely passed peak and was settling into a colorful trippy glow.  <BR>
<BR>
In combination with the mdma, the rest of the night was somewhat like a combination of mdma and 2cb.  The mdma perked me up, while the 2ct7 kept things trippy, sort of 'washed out', and colorful.  I boosted the mdma after a couple hours, and came down from both mdma and 2ct7 more or less in sync.<BR>
<BR>
So 10mg of 2ct7 nasally, for me, came on fast, reached peak in about 30-45 mins, in the middle of about 30-45 mins of 'make it stop' unpleasantness.  After the first hour or so, there was a long slow pleasant decline, reaching baseline, more or less, about 6 or 7 hours later.<BR>
<BR>
If I were to do it nasally again, I might try doing 5mg, waiting 30 mins or so and doing another 5, to hopefully make the first hour more bearable. I also would not eat beforehand.  nasally, it burned slightly and tasted yucky, but wasn't too bad.<!--   End Body   -->

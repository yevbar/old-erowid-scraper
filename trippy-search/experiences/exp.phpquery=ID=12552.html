It was the start of Superbowl Weekand, and I was excited to take a road trip to visit my friend. Little did I know what an adventure I was about to embark on. Late Friday night, we traveled to his apartment after a house party. My friend had mentioned earlier that he could get me a psychoactive drug called AMT. I had tripped before on LSD, Mushrooms, and 2C-T-7, so I had little problem experimenting with a new drug like this. Before heading back to my college the next day, he gave me 120 milligrams of white powder in a small black bag.<BR>
<BR>
I got back to school, and after telling a few of my close friends about the drug, two of them told me that they wanted to be Guinea Pigs and try it with me. My friend Dave was tripping on Mushrooms at the time, and not knowing if mixing the two drugs could have an adverse affect on him. We decided that it would be better if we did it late that night after we went to a party. I drank about five beers at the party before stopping, and drinking water to flush out my system and prepare myself for the trip.<BR>
<BR>
When we got back at 3 AM we divided up the powder on a scale, my friend Dave and I taking 45 milligrams each, and my friend Scott took 30 milligrams. We dumped the powder into the back of our mouths, and chased it with water. I remember thinking that it tasted much worse than Molly on your tongue. 30 minutes after we ingested the powder, I felt something other than the remaining alcohol sweeping through me it faint waves. I remember feeling quite good, sort of like I was on a small amount of MDMA. Soon, my friend Scott and I went to get a drink from the soda machine. I felt restless and was quickly becoming nauseous. I felt that I needed to throw up badly, stopped talking, and ran outside. After dry heaving twice I felt that the wave of nausea was over. We went back upstairs and there were tons of people in my room. I felt confused but interested in what was going on. I wrapped myself up in a blanket, and sat in a chair, not knowing quite what to do with myself.<BR>
<BR>
After about one hour my perception of everything in the room had changed significantly. The room seemed very narrow and smoky, and the tapestries on the walls were much bigger than they had previously seemed to me. Now I felt another wave of nausea. I shivered briefly, and suddenly i felt vomit coming up my throat. I tried to open the door, but could not find the strength to open it as it seemed stuck. I finally got it open a split second before throwing up all over the hall. After this I felt much, much better. I went back into my room, and asked my two friend who had also taken the AMT if they felt okay. They both felt great, and were now talking a lot. We decided to let the others sleep, and go into Dave's room down the hall. We gathered some blankets and a bag of pot, and went to his room. Dave had no shoes, and we could not find any for him, so i gave him one Birkenstock, and he told me, 'Hey man, ones better than none,' and seeming satisfied he sat on the couch.<BR>
<BR>
After 1.5 hours, we all felt good and were tripping hard, so we got out a Hooka and began to smoke. This enhanced the trip greatly, but it hurt my lungs each time i took a rip. We all kept thinking that we weren't getting good hits, and then we would exhale huge amounts of smoke. The music during this time had been Phish and Pink Floyd, and I realized how amazing the music sounded to me. It put me in a really relaxed mood, but I noticed that each sound put visions in my head which made little sense and were incredibly random. During the song 'Run like an Antelope' by Phish, I closed my eyes and saw an Antelope spinning around a rotating gear inside a giant clock. I remember wondering how an antelope could hold onto something since it has hoofs rather than hands, and realized that I must be really messed up. We were all in great moods as we talked and laughed for hours about all sorts of things.<BR>
<BR>
About 3.5 hours after we took the AMT, we decided that the trip had started off feeling like we were on Ecstasy, and then increased in intensity until we felt like we were candy-flipping quite hard. The hallucinations were becoming strong now, as patterns twisted and turned around the room. The patterns in the tapestries were moving in and out of one another, and the posters on the wall displayed images we had never noticed before. My friend's beard was constantly moving back and forth as I talked to him. All of our pupils were fully dilated, and we agreed that the hallucinations were incredibly intense. I remember saying that it felt like I was on .2 grams of molly and three hits of LSD.<BR>
<BR>
After hours of smoking and having fun in Dave's room, we became restless, and decided to walk to the store. At 7 AM, we walked to a gas station. The second the cold air hit me, I felt so uncomfortable that I wanted to run back inside. My friends told me to stop being such a wuss, and we continued towards the store. None of us could walk straight, and everything outside was moving alot. This was the peak of the trip for us, and it was at this time that we realized how serious it was to be in public on a drug of this potency. As we walked by some skiers who were packing up their car, we began to laugh uncontrollably as they wondered what was wrong with us. We stumbled to the convenience store scared shitless by the cars driving by because we couldn't figure out how close they were or how fast they were moving.<BR>
<BR>
In the convenience store, it took us five minutes to decide what to get, and we had no clue as to how loud or akward we sounded. My friend tried to sign his name on hid credit card receipt, but he could not do it for about twenty seconds. After we rushed out of the store he told me that he saw five different moving lines on the receipt, could not figure out which one to sign. On the way back, we spotted a cop, and I remember being incredibly paranoid about a confrontation.<BR>
<BR>
We got back to Dave's room, and i was in a state of awe. I could barely move, and was so fucked up that there were not only distinct movements throughout the room, but my vision was quite blurred and I was getting large stretched trails as I looked around the room. The room seemed to also be a different size than usual, and the lighting patterns were different than every other time I had spent in the room. At about 9 AM, my friend suddenly got very excited and stated, 'Guess what, in 15 hours, the Patriots will have won the damned Superbowl.' We all became extremely excited about the game, and talked about it over the course of the next couple hours.<BR>
<BR>
We smoked and enjoyed ourselves until noon, when Scott had to go to his girlfriend's house still tripping balls. A friend picked him up and drove him away, so we went to my room. We watched tv for a while, but I had no idea of what was happening in the show. The plot seemed completely unconnected to us. We downloaded a program from the internet which plays mathematical fractals on the computer. For those of you who have seen a fractal when you're tripping, you know how crazy they are. They move in and out even when you do mot play them, but when you find a really intricate fractal, you can turn it on, and the picture will repeat itself over and over, causing the picture to move all over the place.<BR>
<BR>
We went back to Dave's room and got gum because we had been clenching our jaws for hours. At this point it was 1 PM, and I was tired from tripping for such a long period of time. I took a shower and came back to Dave's room, feeling refreshed. We both agreed that we were not having the depressing thoughts which go through your head when coming down from a drug such as acid. Instead we both felt like we still candy-flipping, and were not thinking about much of anything because we were so fucked up. My friend left the room for a while, and when he came back he told me that he had vomited twice. I found it odd that we both threw up, but during different phases of the trip.<BR>
<BR>
At about 2:30 PM we both tried to get some sleep before the Superbowl. I was so exhausted that I became overwhelmed with a headache. I wanted to split a strong Ibuprofun with Dave because he mentioned that he had a headache too. We soon took the pill and tried to relieve the throbbing. Zepplin was playing over the speakers, and the sounds were becoming out of control. I heard loud and disturbing scratching sounds, and helicopters seemed to be flying right outside our dorm. At about 3 PM, we finally fell asleep. <BR>
<BR>
I woke up that night during the forth quarter of the Superbowl, and became quite upset that the AMT had caused me to miss so much of the game which I had been so excited for the entire trip. I went and visited my friends around the hall and discovered that many of them had come to visit me and talked to me for good periods of time, and I had no recollection of such conversations taking place. I had missed too many important events that day, and realized that the trip is very intense and a lot of fun, but it lasts for far too long, considering that time goes so slowly during any trip. I realized that my consciousness was still considerably altered when I awoke, and wondered what kind of permanent affects it could have on your brain. I knew it was a rare research chemical that was very potent, and had no clue how much anybody knew about it.<BR>
<BR>
I would recommend AMT only to people who have considerable experience with psychoactives, and feel prepared for a long and intense journey. Nobody should ever trip on this in a dangerous or public environment. It certainly isn't a recreational drug, and should be taken with great care. I am still unsure what lasting effects, if any, there are, but I know that it is a bad drug to put into you're body. I would say that this AMT is a lot of fun while your on it, but should be taken in low doses in a very comfortable environment. <BR>
<BR>
In short: AMT is an enjoyable conscious altering experience, but involves a lengthy time committment, and is a intense factory drug which should never be abused.<!--   End Body   -->

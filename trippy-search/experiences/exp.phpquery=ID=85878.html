<br>
The day started off by me and one of my friends doing shots from a bottle of vodka. We continued to take shots until I was pretty buzzed. I ended up drinking about a fifth of vodka to myself. I was to the point where I was 'blacked out' and don't remember much of what happened an hour after this. <br>
<br>
We had previously bought some magic mushrooms to take that night. These were very good mushrooms and the caps were gold in color. We ate them around 2 hours after the drinking. I barely remember eating them and even forget that I ate them. But then once they hit me I got a little scared and wasn't sure what was happening. But my friends calmed me down and I began to trip. <br>
<br>
Just as a background, I have taken shrooms at least 8 times before this. I knew what to expect and how to handle it. I remember laying in my friends living room and looking at the ceiling and the lines in it looked as if they were waving and moving back and forth. I stared at the ceiling for quite some time and was very entertained. Then I seen a wooden statue that had been carved to look like a Native American. I looked at the face and I could have swore that it was trying to talk to me and I thought it was evil. I had to turn it towards the wall because I couldn't handle looking at it. <br>
<br>
I liked the experience with alcohol due to the fact that it increased the effect and also I felt the shrooms a lot sooner than I ever had. But I was kind of mad the next day because I didn't remember much and kept hearing new things from my friends that I did that night. But overall it was one of my favorite trips.<!--   End Body   -->

Hi All, I recently completed an extraction.<!--   that loosly followed the <BR>
instructions from the URL below.  This is now my <BR>
prefered method of extraction.<BR>
<BR>
http://www.erowid.org/plants/salvia/salvia_extraction1.shtml  -->

<BR>
<BR>
I took 100g of salvia leaves and washed them in a rag under cool  water for about 5min. A lot of brown and green water was rinsed out.  I then dried the leaf, and put it in a blender and turned it into a  semi-fine powder. I dropped the powder into a large glass bottle. I  ran to OSH, and picked up one can of Acetone (cant remember the size,  but it was a normal rectangular can of it, nothing huge), a funnel, a  metal strainer, and some coffee filters. I tested the acetone, and  all seemed good. I poured roughly 3/4 of the can of Acetone into the  bottle with the leaves (I, without thinking, used the plastic funnel  to pour the acetone in. I checked the liquid, and noticed no signs of  any sort of plastic residue in the mix, and inspected the plastic  funnel, and saw no signs of melting. BE SURE not to use plastic with  Acetone! Even though I could not notice any signs of dissolved  plastic, Im sure there was minute ammounts that are not healthy for  me).<BR>
<BR>
I put the lid on the bottle and swirled it around (carefuly not  to get acetone near the lid that has a plastic ring underneath it)  and put it in a cupboard for 17hrs occasionaly swirling the contents  around the bottle. The Acetone was now a black/emerald green. After  this time I poured off the Acetone into another glass bottle (leaving  the wet leave mush at the bottom of the original container, and added  the last bit of Acetone from the can. I let this sit for an  additional 5hrs. When I got home from work, err i mean, after this  time I placed a rag in a clean glass bowl and poured the contents of  the leaf/acetone mush into the rag, wringing out the acetone into the  bowl. I then threw away the 100g of salvia, and added the previous  decanted acetone. I set this outside to evaporate (be sure to read my  warnings about Acetone below). <BR>
<BR>
I went into my stash of salvia leaf  and picked out 10g of nice big dry leaves and set them aside. once  the Acetone was evaporated down to about 3/4 its original volume I  added the leaf and mashed it down so that it was all covered nicely  in the remaining Acetone. I placed this in a window sill, and by  morning It was mostly all evaporated, with only a slight smell of  Acetone. I got a new glass dish and dumped the contents into it, and  made sure to scrape up all the residue stuck to the sides of the  bowl. I placed this back into the sun, and 4hrs later I had no smell  of acetone, and very, very black leaves. I crushed these up, and  placed them in a bottle for a later date. Or so I thought.<BR>
<BR>
That night a friend of mine was in town from NY, and he had  previously smoked salvia with me before, so I thought what the heck,  Ill try the new extraction. We were in a dark living room, with the  television on as the only light source. I placed a pinch in my bowl,  and finished it off in one hit. As I held it in I felt strange, but  It was a familiar feeling. Before I could hand the pipe over to him,  I was repeating 'oh my gosh, oh my gosh' over and over out loud. I  fell back into my chair and watched as a circle of wood planks  emerged from around my television and began spinning. I couldnt hear  what my friend was saying to me, but I managed to mutter out that  this extraction was very strong, and that I was sorry if it was too  strong for him (he hadnt yet smoked it). I felt a deep sencerity  towards him, in making sure he understood that it was stronger than  anything I had smoked before, and that I was sorry. <BR>
<BR>
He took his hit, and set the pipe down and proceded to get up and shut the front door, almost falling over. We were laughing very hard and both not sure  what was happening. He began describing what He was seeing in the  corners of the room, and I kept just saying 'wow' and 'oh my gosh'  over and over. I tried standing at one point and felt as if there was  a huge stone tied around my neck. I managed to get back into my  chair, and stay their for the remainder of the visuals (about 15min,  with a 20min come down). I could describe the trip in greater detail,  but this is meant to be a note on the extraction method, not the trip.<BR>
<BR>
CONCLUSION: This extraction was stronger than anything I had tried  before. I thought I had 'broken through' before this, but was really  wrong. Last night was my first breakthrough (ill stick to that till I  smoke again probably) even though I have had Salvia in my possesion  for over 2 years now, and have smoked it many times, and tried many  extractions. This is however the first time Ive used Acetone. You may  have wondered why Ive capitalized the word 'Acetone' throughout this  message, well its because I have a new respect for it as a salvinorin  exctractor. I was sure It wouldnt work because of the short time I  let it sit. I was accustom to using 99% Isapropyl and letting it sit  for days or weeks, with only so-so results. But this is amazingly  strong. The recipe is for 10g of 10x Salvia, but its really more like  10.1x (right?) since I didnt take out 10g from the original 100g used  in the process. I used an additional 10g to evaportate the extraction  onto. <BR>
<BR>
Needless to say Im very happy with it. Be VERY careful with  Acetone though. One strong smell of it will leave your head spinning  leading me to beleive the fumes are very toxic to your brain cells.  Be sure you have plenty of vetilation, and nothing that could create  a spark (including synthetic clothes, or a fan motor) Acetone fumes fill the room very quickly. Whenever it is uncovered in large  quantities work very quickly. Also be sure not to get any of the Acetone/Extraction on your clothing or counter tops. The clorophyl (im too tired to lookup that word, or to think how to spell it right, sorry) stains very easily.<BR>
<BR>
Hope this helps some people out there.<BR>

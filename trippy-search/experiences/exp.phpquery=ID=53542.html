Here's a brief description of the effects of a low dose of 4-HO-DiPT in myself. I hope it will be as interesting for you to read it as it was for me to experience it. I'm in my early thirties, don't use any medication, and have some experience with other substances, but none in the last several days, except for my regular (a few cups per day) coffee habit.<BR>
<BR>
My mindset was relaxed, interested in a bit of gentle experimentation, and possibly planning to go into town later.<BR>
<BR>
At home, on a saturday evening, 15 minutes after a sandwich dinner I took 3.5 mg of 4-HO-DiPT powder oral with water. The powder was black powder, as it had been kept unrefrigerated for a fair amount of time. The stuff tastes bitter with a tryptaminy taste. What is it about these substances? The more interesting the effect, the nastier the taste? Bleechh.<BR>
<BR>
Some 10 minutes later I feel a bit of belly-butterflies, and wonder if that's just anticipation, or a first alert? Naah. As I had already started typing the notes for this report at the time, I noticed some trouble with my spelling, some 15 minutes after the dose. I briefly wonder if this is or is not an effect. As I didn't feel anything else yet by 30 minutes, it probably wasn't.<BR>
<BR>
40 minutes after ingestion I start to feel some neck & shoulder tension, a bit of dizzyness, and the aforementioned butterflies. 5 minutes later the effect is quite clearly there. The music I'm playing suddenly sounds a lot better, I feel all happy & euphoric, and there's still the muscle tension. Nausea, CEV, OEV, and even the breathing & swirling of surfaces I've often seen is quite distinctly absent. Only the decoration cloth behind my computer seems to breathe a bit. (That particular effect is strongly associated with my computer being turned on, and much less so with me being turned on.)<BR>
<BR>
At T+50min I go to a bar that's within crawling distance of my house. I come there fairly regularly, and expect to meet some of the regular interesting people there. I ended up talking to some of them that I hadn't really talked to before. One of them told me he could not distinguish between memories of dreams and memories of reality. This was very interesting to me philosophically, as I had recently been thinking about the whole subject of identity and memory. <BR>
<BR>
In general I felt slightly more aware, confident, and calm than normal. While I was writing up these experinces later in the evening (at T + 03h15), I considered that this may be a combination of reduced inhibition and enhanced self-acceptance. Of course all my thoughts seemed more true, relevant, and insightful now than they normally are :-) The question was whether that's my perception of my thoughts, or my actual thoughts. In retrospect, I think it's a little bit of both.<BR>
<BR>
At T+03h00 I left the bar, I was just done with being there. Normally I probably would've stayed for another hour or so, until the place closes. After I left, I had a brief look around town for some cannabis, but no place was open that sold any. (Yes, I live in Holland, and yes, 'coffee shops' do close before other bars in this particular town.)<BR>
<BR>
When I get back home, 10 minutes later, I feel like having some yoghurt (appetite still quite ok). The strawberry yoghurt tasted incredibly good. Interestingly the next morning the cup of strawberry yoghurt is still sealed, and the cup of peach yoghurt is open. (It really did taste good!) On the way up, I took some time to sit in a chair in my living room and just sit for a while, instead of going straight to my bedroom. This is not something I'd normally do, normally I'd just consider it for a second, and then go straight up. <BR>
<BR>
This substance does seem to reduce inhibitions a bit, not sure whether this is through enhanced energy/motivation, or reduced inhibition. I think it's enhanced motivation.<BR>
<BR>
Still no visuals at all, music is nice, slightly enhanced. Still very much awake, bit of butterflies still. The effect did start sloping off after about an hour in the bar, so around T+02:00. I still don't notice any OEV or CEV whatsoever. At home, I do notice more underarm smell/sweat than usual, which in my experience (and body) is typical of pharmacological stimulation.<BR>
<BR>
I notice that I'm doing some fairly useful thinking about own behavior, and interaction with others. Not in the euphoric way that I know from MDMA though, but more insightful feeling.<BR>
<BR>
Having some interest in the details of pharmacology, I did of course have to figure this one out as well (T+03h45)For those who are interested in such things (only me on that particular night): No change in sexual function (apart from slightly enhanced tactile sensitivity).<BR>
<BR>
By T+04h05 I feel pleasantly tired, and sense myself drifting into and out of dreams, so I decide to go to sleep. After about an hour I realize that me deciding to go to sleep, and actually going to sleep are not the same thing. Incidentally, by this time there's a very subtle waviness when staring at the speckled bathroom floor.<BR>
<BR>
As the sleep thing wasn't working, started watching a movie in stead, Tarkovsky's 'Stalker'. It's a fairly complex but slow movie, and I dozed off half way through the movie. Until then I had no trouble following it, or keeping my attention on it.<BR>
<BR>
The next day I sleep in, as it was fairly late when I went to sleep. After waking up I enjoy watching the rest of the movie (and eating the rest of the peach yoghurt), while not experiencing any noticable hangover. The next several days, I don't recognize any hangover effects either.<BR>
<BR>
In summary, I had quite a pleasant, gentle (I guess comparable to one or two glasses of alcohol), and insightful experience. I'll definitely be visiting this substance again, possibly at a higher dosage, possibly at this dosage.<!--   End Body   -->

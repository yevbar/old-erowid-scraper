I have two stories, one of recent recreational use that turned out well, and one past story with a not so happy ending.<BR>
<BR>
#1 To start this out -- I'm actually prescribed this stuff. I'm bad at taking it on a regular basis and am supposed to use it for panic attacks and what not (I do and it really helps). I also use it recreationally. My partner and I took about 6g of Clonazepam (though you can adjust it for your weight or as desired). It usually takes a while to kick in (like a half hour) but has a very long half life (you can feel it still the next day -- this can be good or bad). Its much like Valium, and in fact is a member of the same class of drugs as Valium.<BR>
<BR>
Back to the story... My partner and I had just gotten done with a busy day of packing and moving and were ready to relax. We are currently in the phase where drinking doesn't appeal much to us, so we decided to take a few of the Klonopin. Once it kicks in, it is similar to a drunken stupor-- with a clear mind. My body begins to feel a little rubbery and very very relaxed. Makes me feel happy, actually.  I can either get stuck to my chair -- or go for a very fun walk. My eyes feel as though they are moving twice the speed of my body. Bodily coordination is not the best (staggering and such). <BR>
<BR>
My body feels heavy, and if I bend over too quickly everything spins like mad. I find it a great way to have a fun evening. We drank a lot of grapefruit juice while doing it. I've heard (and this may be a rumor) that it is supposed to increase the effects of benzos (among other pharmies). If anyone knows otherwise, I'd be happy to listen. <BR>
<BR>
Klonopin doesn't hold a candle to Valium. I myself do not like Valium because I feel messed up for days after I take it. It also makes me incredibly sleepy. I like the more subtle, less potent stuff.<BR>
<BR>
#2 In a drunken accident a few years back, I took a few too many Klonopin (10-15mg tabs I think-- not sure) along with some other meds. I ended up with an ambulance ride for 4 blocks with 5 attempts to get an IV in my arm (no success). I ended up drinking activated charcoal (YUCK) and managed to hallucinate due to the tegretol (the other medication that was too high in my blood stream). Needless to say, I couldn't stand up without help for two days because my legs would buckle beneath me. <BR>
<BR>
With this in mind, make your decision to do any drug wisely. Don't be an asshole and test the limit like I did. Use your drugs responsibly and know how much is too much.<!--   End Body   -->

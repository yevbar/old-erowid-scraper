To save a long story and a bit of rambling, suffice it to say that I had 10 pills of generic vicodin ES (7.5/750mg).  Not really knowing any particular recreational dosage, I went online and found report of 1 to 4 pills.  I also read a bit about acetominaphen(sp?) being bad for your liver in high doses, so I decided to take three of the pills and do a simple cold-water extraction.<br>
<br>
6:something PM<br>
<br>
The process was very basic- break each pill in half, crush into powder.  Fill a 1oz shotglass a little under halfway with cold water from a Brita Filter (standard household water filter), add the entire three pills worth of powder to the glass, stir well, and put in refridgerator.  Half an hour later most of the aceto (filler) had very clearly sunk to the bottom.  The entire contents of the shotglass were poured, very slowly, through an unbleached coffee filter, into another shotglass.  <br>
<br>
The filler material had become a chalky paste-like goo, so I poured as much as possible into the filter, added more water to the original shotglass (to clean out the remains), and filtered that as well. After a few minutes, I had a cloudy, but much less so than originally, half-shot of solution.  This sat on my windowsill with the window open for about five hours, mostly unintentionally.<br>
<br>
11:11 PM- <br>
Ingested the filtered liquid in a glass of Orange juice (store brand with calcium.)  I didn't really notice any particularly bad or different taste to the mix, although it did leave a strange aftertaste.  That could be because I've never had this particular brand of juice before, or it could be the vicodin.<br>
<br>
11:24 PM-<br>
I haven't eaten much for dinner tonight, just a soup made from chicken and vegetable broth with some rice and egg, and this IS my first experience with vicodin, but I think it is starting to affect me already.  There is a very slight pressure in my head, the kind usually associated with any departure from baseline sobriety.  I am sitting in my bedroom in a house which I have just recently moved into, and finished setting up today.  So my surroundings are a bit unfamiliar, but very comfortable.  There are no lights except for a blacklight along one wall and a lava lamp on the other.  The computer monitor, however, is bright white, and I think that in this setting, it would be irritating my eyes regardless of ingesting any substances.  I'll continue writing later.  Before I take a break from writing I must add that the effects are definately beginning now, very typical opiate body load.  I am 'spacing out' frequently, and do feel quite relaxed.<br>
<br>
11:47 PM-<br>
Definately not sober.  The feeling is extremely similar to being drunk, without the difficulty in keeping a train of thought.  I feel very warm, although it may be my room.  I am definately much more sensitive to light, and every time I look at the computer monitor, it takes my eyes a second or two to readjust.  It takes longer still when looking back into the darkness of my room.  This is making typing difficult as the keyboard is shaded from the light of the monitor.  My kitten is asleep on my lap, and having turned on some relaxing music, I feel as if I could be purring as well.<br>
<br>
On a side note, during the onset (almost immediately after consumption) I was experiencing a bit of doscomfort in my stomach, almost like a hunger pang, which it may well have been.  In any case, it is gone completely, and I feel a bit numb (physically, not mentally).<br>
<br>
12:30 AM-<br>
The effects haven't intensified yet, if they're going to at all.  On the other hand, they haven't lessened either- very consistant.  Dark Side of the Moon is playing, my cat is still asleep on my lap, and I'm reading a great story.  It may just be the doasge I've taken tonight, but I don't find this to be such an incredible substance.  I know that I have an addictive personality, and could quite easily become addicted to opiates such as this, simply because it's a very pleasurable, calming, peaceful intoxication, which doesn't make you feel stupid, like alcohol or marijuana can.  On the other hand, it's not that great that I'd want to do it all the time, and fortunately, I can neither afford more or procure more if I wanted to.  But for the time being, it's very nice.<br>
<br>
1:30 AM-<br>
The Floyd playlist is over.  I've moved on to NOFX.  I feel less intoxicated.  Definately still not sober though, sort of like one or two good hits of marijuana, or a couple of beers.  It's hard to tell if I'm less intoxicated than I was, or the change of atmosphere (music) is making me feel that way.  I took three pills worth tonight, minus whatever I lost in the filtering process, and next time I think I'll bump it up to five.  That'll leave me with two, which will be nice to have in case I actually need a painkiller, or a little something to put me to sleep.<br>
<br>
Considering the fact that I'm still not sober, I won't end this log quite yet.  I'll stay up a while longer to see if there is a noticable comedown, and I'll write again before I go to sleep.  I think I'll wait until morning to finish this, so I can comment on 'morning after' effects, if any.<br>
<br>
2:56 AM-<br>
Surprisingly, I'm stll feeling the effects of the vicodin.  It's possible some of it is just plain being tired at this point, but I'm definately still intoxicated.  I'd love to stay up and see just how long it lasts, especially since I've heard (read) that the comedown is rather sudden, but I'm about to fall asleep at the keyboard here.  I think I'll find sleep easily tonight, and wrap this up in the morning.<br>
<br>
----------<br>
<br>
Next day, 5:15 PM-<br>
I fell asleep last night almost the instant I hit the pillow, and didn't wake up until my cat started nuzzling my face.  When I first woke up I felt a bit groggier than normal, but that could be a result of changing my sleep pattern.  I've been going to sleep at midnight and waking up around 10 AM consistantly, and last night I went to sleep around 3:30 AM and woke up around 1:30 PM today.  Once I got moving though, the groggyness went away.<br>
----------------<br>
<br>
Would I use vicodin again?  I might, if I had nothing better to do.  I wouldn't do it recreationally, as it doesn't seem worth the trouble of finding and buying the pills, and filtering them.  I'll mostly likely use the last of what I have left, and then if the pills find me, we'll see.<br>
<br>
I would HIGHLY recommend filtering out the filler.  Just looking at the chalky white crud that filtered out is enough to dissuade me from simply popping the pills.  I hope this report has been informative and helpful.  And as always, don't base your actions solely on this report- read as much as you can, including the other reports here on Erowid, the facts and dosage information, and especially the off-site links.<br>
<br>
Love and light, good karma and vibes.<!--   End Body   -->

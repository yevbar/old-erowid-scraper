After reading all about dimenhydrinate on the web, I thought it sounded like fun so, me and a friend tried it out the other day.  I recently robotripped for the first time, and thought it was fun, so I figured I should try the dramamine.  We both ate 12 motion sickness pills with 50 mg dimenhydrinate each, then smoked a bowl.  It seemed like just after we were don smoking, the pills kicked in.  Everything started to feel funny, and I was very tired.  We ate a couple caffeine pills to stay awake.<BR>
Now I was really fucked up.  Everything was moving, sort of like a weak acid trip, and I kept hearing voices in the distance.  I dont know if I was just hearing shit, or if there were really people talking far away and my perceptions were just increased.  I noticed with the visuals, I could almost see the watery fluid in my eye moving around, and I would see faint 'strings' in the air.<BR>
<BR>
It was very hard to concentrate.  My friend and I would talk, and forget what we were talking about right in the middle of the conversation.  We had a sober person with us who would help remind us of what we were talking about.<BR>
<BR>
I was only really fucked up like this though for a few hours.  The trip lasted somewhat longer, but after about 2-3 hours I was able to talk like a normal person and the visual and auditory hallucinations had lessened.  I found it very easy to fall asleep that night and woke up the next morning feeling fine.  I think the next time I'd like to mix it with cough syrup and see how that is.<!--   End Body   -->

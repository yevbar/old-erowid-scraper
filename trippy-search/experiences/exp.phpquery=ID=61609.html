One cold evening, I came back to my dorm after drinking 4-5 beers. I was tipsy and definitely feeling the alcohol (I'm a lightweight). I decided to smoke some of the 10x Wormwood Resin I had recently bought 3 grams of online. I put 1.5 grams into a bowl and smoked it. <br>
<br>
I took the following notes on the experience the day after:<br>
<br>
The dollhouse effect existed slightly, every object in the room seemed like it was in its 'right place'. Everything was good with the world, and I felt a very mild euphoria.  But it didn't “hit” me, there was no rush. The feeling was extremely subtle in its build-up. <br>
<br>
I felt extremely at peace with what was going on around me. My friends were coming into my room having partied all night, and I was glad to see and interact with them. I felt much less inhibited than normal, I'm an introvert and often listen more than I talk. However, my desire to interact and talk with others increased. In fact, I had a lot of fun talking to one kid who I find extremely annoying when I'm sober.<br>
<br>
I was definitely energized. It was going on 1:00 AM and the sedating effects of the 4-5 beers I had drunk were in full force, but after smoking wormwood, I felt highly energized. I was motivated to get out of bed (where I had smoked) and do things. I felt focused and motivated to be productive. Simultaneously, I felt relaxed, and content with my current situation. It was a pleasant mixture of calmness and a readiness to get things done.<br>
<br>
Interestingly, after about 4 minutes, it seemed that the wormwood had almost completely wiped away alcohol buzz (from ~4.5 beers). I became more in control – it was like smoking the wormwood sobered me up from being tipsy. When I say 'sobered me up,' I mean that the uncoordination from drinking alcohol went away. <br>
<br>
I became more introspective, and more thoughtful about everyday things. I had a discussion with a friend of mine who can talk for hours without realizing you don't care what he's saying, but I didn’t get bored. I just wanted to know how he felt and wanted to let him know how I was feeling. <br>
<br>
There were no bloodshot eyes, no headache, and no dry mouth. The smell lingered for a while afterward, the next morning when I woke up, the smoked wormwood odor was apparent and unpleasant.<br>
<br>
When lighting the substance (which was powdered), it was hard to get it smoking. <br>
<br>
Over the course of the night, I dropped a shot glass out of my third story window (it had nothing to do with being uncoordinated form the wormwood, I didn't lose any motor control from it). Under normal circumstances, I never would’ve gone down the elevator, passed the guy who checks you in at the front desk, gone outside into the snow, and retreived it. But I felt motivated to do so, and did. Normally I'd be too lazy, but it felt like it would be easy to do - and was the right thing to do. So I brought it back.<br>
<br>
I experienced no visual hallucinations. However, everything seemed slightly surreal – I was in complete control of my body and mind, and I could see perfectly clearly, but it was as if there were a layer between the world and me. I experienced settings I was very familiar with (like my dorm room) in a slightly new way. <br>
<br>
It seemed like consequences didn’t really matter that much, since everything was ok – i.e., I could go to my resident advisor and tell him I just smoked in my room, even though he could report me for that. I didn't do that and wasn't planning on it, it just seemed like the world was at peace and minor infractions weren't important. <br>
<br>
I fell asleep easily when I went to bed about 2 hours after smoking. Overall, it was not a body high at all – it was very much a cerebral high. I was clearheaded, but my perceptions of things were altered. <br>
<br>
I became more inquisitive and felt like talking (this is slightly unusual for me). And physical activity was a lot more fun than normal – my roommate and a friend were wrestling around in the foyer of our floor, and it was fun to watch and participate in the revelry. <br>
<br>
When talking to people, I maintained direct eye contact for more time than would be normal if I were sober. I looked into people’s eyes much more as they spoke (but not in an awkward way). I felt more connected and interested in other peoples' feelings.<br>
<br>
I also thought about a bad argument I'd had earlier that day with my girlfriend, and it didn’t bother me as much – I simply acknowledged it and thought, 'everything’s okay.' <br>
<br>
I smoked some more in order to intensify the experience (and hopefully achieve some visuals), but it seemed like I had reached my limit and couldn't get any higher than I was. This was slightly frustrating, as I wanted to be more powerfully affected, but overall the experience was extremely positive. I enjoyed very much the psychoactive effects and want to try it again. It's an intriguing and agreeable experience that I want to feel again. Perhaps I'll try a liquid extract to see how the experience differs from smoking it.<!--   End Body   -->

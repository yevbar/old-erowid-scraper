To read the quick version of this story, scroll down to paragraph 5, but I'd like to give you the background story:<br>
<br>
I tried marijuana for the first time when I was 14. I was introduced to it by some friends I knew from high school. My first experience with marijuana was quite groovy. While high I understood why people did it. My whole world was amazing and beautiful. It made me feel like the happiest person alive.<br>
<br>
It was a while after that where I wasn't smoking, but if anyone offered I wouldn't have turned them down either. That period lasted about two years, until I moved to a new school and met new people that smoked weed. I wanted to be accepted as a 'Cool Kid' so I decided to hang with them.  Unfortunately, they didn't live too far from me and I had easy access to their house.  I decided I wanted to get high before school one day, so I lied to my mom and told her that I was going over a friends house to help tutor them with some math homework (which I am completely horrible at)and that they were going to take me to school.<br>
<br>
The biggest sign that it was a bad idea was that it was dark and rainy at 6 in the morning. It took a good 20 minutes to walk to their house, all the while I was nervous thinking about what I had lied about, and what I was about to do.  Once there I knocked on the door and a man I did not know answered the door. I knew my so-called friends nickname so I asked for him, once they heard the nickname they let me in. 'Leave your shoes at the door.' the unfamiliar man said. I did accordingly and began to sit and wait to see my friend. 'You know anybody lookin' for a computer?' the man asked. I replied 'No, but if I find someone I'll definitely let them know'.<br>
<br>
Our small talk continued until my friend woke up (I was there quite early) and we began to talk and catch up. I found out the unfamiliar guy was his brother, and I met his other brothers, one the youngest and the other the oldest. Keep in mind the setting was already horrible, I didn't know a lot about my friend or his brothers, visiting his house for the first time, on a dark rainy morning.  Eventually his oldest brother got us a blunt wrap and proceeded to roll us a blunt. 'Your mama know you smoke?' the oldest asked. I don't quite remember what I said but my friend replied to my comment by saying, 'I told mines I wasn't stoppin'.'<br>
<br>
Eventually the smoke began to fill the room as the blunts were being passed. Someone turned on a cd and I was already experiencing the onset, I felt comfortable and euphoric. After what felt like 20 minutes I began to feel like something was wrong. I took another hit and I realized I couldn't feel anything. The younger brother said something to the effect of, 'Man, you smoke like a chimney!' I nervously laughed.<br>
<br>
Before I knew it I felt like hours had passed and I was just sitting in a chair, watching the world continue around me. It felt like my legs had sunk into the floor and I couldn't feel them. The younger brother started talking to my friend and I literally couldn't understand what he was saying. His phrases began to loop and repeat and I started to get scared out of my wits. My friend decided out of nowhere to do a freestyle rap. <br>
<br>
To this day the melody of that rap is the most demonic I have ever heard. I don't remember his words, just the melody. All the while I was thinking to myself about all I had ever heard about street drugs. I heard my parent's voices mocking me for being so dumb. I eventually asked out of curiosity 'How do you guys think?', because I was literally that desensitized. The response just made things worse, the oldest smiled and said, 'We don't.' I began to think 'What is the world coming to?! Is this what other teenagers are doing behind closed doors?'. <br>
<br>
I eventually came to the conclusion (that wasn't really founded, anyway) that they were trying to get me addicted to some type of drug by using marijuana as a cover-up. They were trying to take advantage of me. No, they were trying to kill me! I asked to be shown to the bathroom, my friend just lazily pointed his finger toward the kitchen door without even looking up. Somehow I found my way to the kitchen and eventually to the bathroom where I turned on the light and looked at myself in the mirror. My eyes were completely bloodshot-red (which is logical seeing as I had just smoked marijuana) and I looked just straight out of it. I looked at my cell phone to keep track of time because it felt like I had been their for hours. <br>
<br>
I had only been there for basically an hour-and-a-half. I prayed and asked God to forgive me, seeing as I was and still am a Christian, and walked back out to the living room. Not too long after that our ride arrived. I had decided seeing as they were 'trying to kill me,' I wasn't going anywhere with them, even if it was to school. I eventually broke it to them that I was just going to take the bus (another lie) they agreed and drove off. When I say I darted and ran like I was going to be chased, I'm not lying. I began to think that they were following me and we were playing a game of cat-and-mouse. I was scared that they were going to pop up any minute, snatch me up into the car and drive me off to nowhere and kill me.<br>
<br>
I ran about 5 blocks down to a park that had a hill. Once at the top I began to have an extremely psychotic episode. I began to yell, scream, and pray for God to deliver me. I screamed so much I began to throw up. It wasn't a whole lot because I had had nothing to eat. I began to again think about what my parents would say if they found out and what people would say about my 'friends' once I reported them to the police. After fighting with myself for what felt like 20 minutes, I called 911. <br>
<br>
I told the 911 operator the entire story and she assured me that the authorites were on their way.  I don't know if she dispatched them or not but they never came. I decided that staying there wasn't going to do me any good so I walked, and walked, and walked, and walked for a period of about 7 hours (no lie, I looked at my cell periodically) so much to the point where I had blisters, until it was 3:30 and I could come home like I had been at school all day. I was determined to not put my parents through a mistake I had made. <br>
<br>
Once home, I still caught myself tripping. I was scared to close my eyes because all I would see were spiders crawling on my wall. I realized it was easier to sleep with a nightlight than in the complete dark.  The next morning my dad woke me up for class. I looked at him, smiled, and privately thanked God I was still alive to see him.<!--   End Body   -->

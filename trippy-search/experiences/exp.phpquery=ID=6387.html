It is almost a habit of mine to experiment with different levels of this particular substance to see what it will do to me. I was heavily interested in seeing extremes a couple of years back, but recently with more research and experience I have been exploring relatively lower doses and analyzing their effects on my existence.<BR>
<BR>
Usually the setting will be somewhere public, such as in class or at work. I have the attitude that no one really knows for sure what is going on inside you unless you tell. <BR>
<BR>
If I do this habitually, I will deplete whatever chemical it reacts with in my brain and the pleasant effects go away, and are replaced with irritability and dry mouth, if anything at all. <BR>
<BR>
The last time I explored what this would do was last night, in April. At 9:30 I only took two maximum-strength pills (60 mg pseudoephedrine each) - through experimentation I have found that this is the dose that heightens the positive effects and minimizes the negative effects. At higher doses, I have seen an increase of nausea (240 to 420 mg) that overruns any 'body high' feeling I may get. 180 mg would sometimes make me too listless to function. However, remember that everyone's body chemistry is different and what works for me may not work for you.<BR>
<BR>
Within thirty minutes, I was beginning to feel dissociated. I took a very lax attitude toward my work and would try to accomplish tasks with the least amount of effort possible. All I wanted to do was sit in my chair and stare at my computer screen. Words were slow to come. When I would be asked a question, I would have to think it over in my mind before producing an answer. Even then, I would pause and have to think...'what's the word I am looking for' many times. Co-workers were none the wiser, having known that I had not acquired much sleep the night before. <BR>
<BR>
By the time I left work at midnight I had gotten quite a buzz. I  felt a pleasant sensation and driving home seemed effortless - probably too effortless. Please be careful when driving, as it seems like I was just playing a video game. I had to remind myself that cars are real and that I was not just floating home. I found that I could breathe more easily and sing higher and better than I had before. I am not sure whether that was just a shift in confidence or if the decongestant effects of the pseudoephedrine really caused the improvement. <BR>
<BR>
Finally, I got online and really wanted to chat, but by then I was peaking - it was about 1:00 by then. I could not really think straight and I wanted to lie in my bed. Lying there, I knew how wonderful it felt to be here, I could feel how my blankets were wrapped around me and I felt dissociated from almost everything, alone in time and space. It was a wonderful, relieved feeling unlike with anything else I have ever done. <BR>
<BR>
It's the type of thing that makes me want that feeling, all the time, and it is difficult to accept that I cannot do this every day or it will not be the same. When it's gone, it's gone.<!--   End Body   -->

It is now 3 days after my Salvia experience. It's taken me this long to get any kind of a grip on what happened. Let me quickly say, I've done a variety of different drugs in my life. Plenty of MJ, LSD, Cocaine, hash, scrips, etc. and I've had my share of ultra-bizzaro trips on LSD. I wouldn't consider myself an 'expert' on these things, but I've always felt that if I could go through those acid trips in one piece, nothing else could phase me. I was wrong as wrong can be.<br>
<br>
I got my 6X extract in the mail and put it away for a while. I read most of the reports and watched a few videos on YouTube. Seemed like it was intense, but very short, thus nothing I can't handle. Mind you, it's been over 20 years since I touched my last acid.<br>
<br>
So one Sunday, I was alone and thought, now is as good a time as any. I split off about 1/10th of a gram and prepared the bong. Closed the door to my office, and put the beginning of '3000 Miles To Graceland' on the tv. This was a big mistake. The first intro tune to the movie is Filter's 'It's Gonna Kill Me'.<br>
<br>
So I hit the bong and sucked it in all at once. Sitting at my desk holding it, thinking 'this is a bunch of crap', when all the sudden, something like electric water filling the room from the floor up, or some kind of wave, started at my toes and started moving up my body very fast. I said out loud, 'Here it comes!' and then as soon as I said that, said, 'NO! Wait!' It was taking me over completely and I wasn't sure I was ready to go. Since I had read many reports, I was expecting something like 'an 8 hour acid trip compacted into 5 minutes', but then... as fast as that initial electric wave took me over it was gone. Then... nothing. I said, 'this isn't right.' and turned to the right to get up because I felt very weird. That's when the Salvia Gravity hit me. It pulled me to the floor and I couldn't move.<br>
<br>
Filter is still singing about how 'It's Gonna Kill Me!', but I'm ignoring it now. My first thought as I lay on the floor, this is NOT like acid. This is not like anything. There's no high, no trails, no buzz, no drunkeness, no nothing. And I see my old reality drifting away. All of it. My life, everyone else's life, all the things humans do, houses, birds, fish, everything that comprises consensus reality, suddenly now on the other side. But the other side of what?<br>
<br>
I felt like I could still see consensus reality, but I was in another dimension looking back at it. I was in a place that our normal reality can't see and cannot go. And I felt wrong. I felt like, I should not be here. But I've been here before. But it doesn't matter. Humans should not see this. It would destroy reality as we know it. I could still see my room (office) and everything in it, but the entire room was now in this dimension with me. This is all there was now, and there's no going back. And I wanted to go back, but the gravity in here simply wouldn't let me move.<br>
<br>
I thought, I know I took some kind of drug, but I've obviously gone way too far. No one warned me that I would be stuck in this place forever. I began to melt into the carpet. Gravity was positively overbearing. And I did this to myself for what... I didn't even get high! I'm trapped here in this empty dead space, and can't get back to that fake reality that everyone thinks is so real. I wasn't necessarily scared, but I knew this was not some sort of 'fun' thing to do. I knew what fun was. Being in consensus reality, smoking cigarettes, talking to people, drinking and socializing, tripping on acid.... those things are fun. This.... I don't know what the hell this is. It's some sort of extra dimension that has no purpose, and way too much gravity. Time didn't really stop, it just has no meaning in here. There was no laughing at any time, but there was also no terror.<br>
<br>
I thought then, they're going to find me like this. My girlfriend will come home and find me trapped in this space, but there will be nothing anyone can do. There's only one way into this place, and there's no way back out. And with that I managed to reach up my arm towards my desk. Failed. Thought, okay, I'm gonna need another minute here. Then tried again, and was able to slowly get up. I freaked out at what had just happened (though I wasn't sure what that was) and grabbed all the rest of the Salvia and immediately threw it in the trash. (which I later dug back out) I said to myself, that is something I never need to do again.<br>
<br>
And then I had to get outside right away. I HAD to. I had to make sure that the reality I knew 10 minutes ago still existed. I made it outside by the pool, fired up a cigarette and spent about an hour wondering, 'what the hell just happened??'<br>
<br>
Since then, I've read many more of the reports, and I think I've figured something out. I think all the craziness like vortexes and swirling and being cut in half and such, is possibly a result of getting caught halfway between consensus reality and Salvia reality, as a consequence of not smoking enough. Perhaps? Because my initial 'electric wave' seemed very much like that, like it could possibly be very much like an acid trip. But it was FAST. And it passed within a second. That's when I was dropped into Salvia reality. I think I'd like to try about half of what I smoked last time, and see if I can get caught in between. It seems like that's where all the fun is. Because once I was fully in Salvia reality, there was just nothing. A nice view of my former reality, that's all.<br>
<br>
Summing up: I found Salvia to not be enjoyable at all. It was definately not 'fun'. But at the same time, it wasn't 'bad' either. It was just WEIRD. Very very weird. I remember thinking to myself, who the hell would ever do this twice? It did scare me a little in the fact that it was so damn powerful. I thought I could handle anything because I had conquered LSD, but in comparing the two, LSD is a very warped, twisted, freaky, awesome, crazy MANIPULATION of consensus reality. I can shape the LSD trip however I want. But Salvia took me completely OUT of consensus reality and plopped me down somewhere else. I didn't get to shape ANYTHING. I was along for the ride whether I wanted to be or not. I was definately not prepared for that because I was expecting something completely different.<br>
<br>
The entire trip lasted 4 minutes. It shocked me to my core. And being a war veteran as well as a drug veteran, I'm not easily shocked. I think I would prefer to un-know what Salvia showed me. Ignorance really is bliss sometimes.<!--   End Body   -->

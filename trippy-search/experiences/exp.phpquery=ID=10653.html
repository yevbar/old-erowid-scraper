I was told that taking 8 Unisom caps would cause a real wicked trip.  I had been getting into various OTC drugs (mostly DXM), and I thought it was worth a shot.  The person who told me about it weighed significantly less than I, so I figured it was 'safe' (as safe as something like sleeping pills can be...).<BR>
<BR>
One night, I tried taking all 8.  Sat around for awhile, with no reaction for about an hour to an hour and a half.  Finally, I began feeling very strange, like my head was leaving my body... much like a bad case of medicine-head... but not unpleasant.  This feeling became stronger as time passed.  Finally, I hit the peak (which lasts quite long, it seems).  It's hard to describe.  Everything is very surreal and clouded.  I was able to act completely normal, however.  I asked a few of my friends (who I met with after taking the pills) if I seemed odd.  They of course said 'yes', but no more so than usual ;)<BR>
<BR>
Now, while the trip itself is rather fun, there was one downside to it.  This is a very strange side effect, but here goes..... For some reason, everytime I sat down, my ass would hurt.  Not like it had been kicked or something, but like the muscles in my ass were very tense, although it didn't feel like they actually were.  I know this is odd, but it is true.  I thought that it was a fluke, but the second (and last) time I took 8 caps, the same thing happened.  I have no idea what could cause this, but it was quite annoying.  I suppose if I were out doing stuff that did not require sitting, it would be okay.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, a very interesting experience.<!--   End Body   -->

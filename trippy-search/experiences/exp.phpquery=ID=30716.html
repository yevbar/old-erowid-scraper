8 mg of 2C-T-21 was consumed at 7:30pm on an empty stomach.   I was in an energetic mood, partying with friends as several various venues.  <BR>
<BR>
Compared with a 6 mg dose, 8 mg makes me feel more energetic and alert.  Linear thinking is still problematic but with a sufficient amount of concentration, it was possible to follow and participate in conversation.  I felt little desire to connect with strangers, but was filled with love for my friends.   <BR>
<BR>
As I approached peak, about 2.5-3hr post dose, I felt an ill-defined energy surging through me, which at one point became uncomfortably intense, associated with jaw clenching and trembling, and the 'shivers' at some points.   It wasn't real uncomfortable, I just had to remind myself to breathe through it on occasion.   At that point, I was in a loud irritating bar with a lot of unhappy vibes around, and that might have contributed.  Interestingly there was no motor hyperactivity associated.  No other physical symptoms were noted, in particular no nausea.   Later, in a beautiful dance club, I sat at the bar and marveled at the utter beauty of it all.  All night, everything had seemed bathed in candle light.  Real candles were bright and fascinating.   Time dilations occurred intermittently; interestingly, often while smoking cigarettes.  I saw some very subtle '2C' style visuals, for example words seeming to float above the page, pictures look 3D.  Some music seemed so beautiful I thought I would weep.  <BR>
<BR>
I wandered out on the dance floor.  When the lights would hit my eyes, I would squeeze them shut, the afterimages burnished on the inside of my eyelids like neon.  But unlike normal afterimages, these continued to dance and flirt and move around, so that when I open my eyes again, I am surprised that the scene has changed so much.<BR>
<BR>
I stayed at a very pleasant post-peak plateau for several hours before  I was deposited back into reality at 1:44 am promptly, with the feeling that I had just awakened from a beautiful, sensual dream.  I went from tripping my gonads off to being perfectly clear and awake, although a little fatigued.  It's funny how abruptly that transition occurs.  I remember looking at my watch and saying, 'well, I guess it's over.'   Nevertheless I carried around a warm glow for the rest of the evening and most of the next day.  No hangover.  Overall, a satisfactory trip.  Would have been a little more fun to be tripping with someone.  <BR>
<BR>
Conclusions:<BR>
1.  Interestingly, higher doses of 2C-T-21 are more stimulating than lower doses.  This could limit how far I might comfortably go with this drug.  Accurate measuring and dosing is a must in order to avoid discomfort.  Insufflation strikes me as a bad idea.  <BR>
2.  This is a deep. subtle and textured drug.  There are layers of euphoria, and love, and ability to appreciate beauty, and hyper-orality, and sexuality.  I think this would appeal to more mature or introspective individuals than to young partiers. <BR>
3.  Duration of action -- about 5 hours -- seems remarkably constant, with a very predictable and distinct cessation of action.  <BR>
4.  Both 6 and 8mg are active doses for me, just depends on how trippy I want to be, with 6 a more mellow experience and 8 bordering on intense at times.  Based on what I've read, it is not totally clear what the threshold dose is.  New users would be well advised to start low and go slow.  <BR>
<BR>
This will probably be my last report on this particular chemical unless I have an adverse event to report.   Please play safely.  And please don't make a nuisance out of yourself by selling this chemical to kids in clubs, or by driving while intoxicated.   Hopefully if we conduct ourselves responsibly, this chemical will remain below the radar screen and we can continue to enjoy it in the future.<!--   End Body   -->

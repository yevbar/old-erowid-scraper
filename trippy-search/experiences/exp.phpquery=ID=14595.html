This has been one of the worst experiences of my life.  This is not because I had a 'bad trip', but because the physical effects the seeds had on my body.<BR>
I really did not know what to expect because I had never tried any hallucinogins before.  I smoke pot occasionally and drink, that is about it.  After reading that this trip was somewhat milder than acid or shrooms, I decided to give it a go.  I was still somewhat wary of them because I am manic-depressive and didnt want to flip out.  I can say that I looked forward to coming to some sort of inner-peace or epiphany. . . So I guess I expected too much.<BR>
<BR>
I began by purchasing several packets of seeds from a local nursery.  I washed them with liquid laundry detergent and cold water, then let them air dry.  I planned on taking them later that night, so in preparation I cleaned my room and then took a long bath to relax.  At about 10:30pm, I ground the seeds in a coffee grinder, making sure not to let them get hot because I heard heat destroys the lsa.  I then combined the ground seeds with apple-sauce of about equal quantities.  Some of the seed was ground very fine (like a powder), but some were larger chunks.  I brought the mixture up to my room along with a bottle of water and some dried fruit to eat later.  I had a fairly full stomach, which I assumed would lessen any nausea I would have.  I was very wrong.  <BR>
<BR>
It was about 11:10pm when I began to eat the mush, chewing the larger pieces in my mouth, and finished at about 11:20pm.  I turned on some pink floyd, and in an attempt to relax begain to give myself a foot massage and put on lotion.  I started to feel slightly nauseous almost instantly after eating the seeds, but told myself that I was psyching myself out and it was all in my head.  But the nausea was very real.  I assumed that I just needed to wait it out for about an hour, and then I would be fine, but the nausea just intensified.<BR>
<BR>
About an hour later I was suffering from intense nausea and just tried to lay down in a position that didnt hurt too bad.  I tried singing to myself to get my mind off of the nausea, but it didnt help.  I went to the bathroom countless times that night in vain.  I did not throw up.  I have always had problems throwing up. . . The last time I threw up was when I was 9 years old and I havent since.  This is worse because they say throwing up makes you feel better.  I thouroghly regretted ever taking those seeds.  <BR>
<BR>
The rest of my experience is probably very choppy because I kept flitting in and out of conciousness.  These are not necessarily in chronological order. <BR>
<BR>
I just wanted to sleep through the pain but kept waking up.  I could feel my pupils dilating, then getting smaller, etc.  On one of my bathroom breaks I looked in the mirror and my pupils were shaking and the size was fluctuating. . .big, small, big, bigger, small, big, etc.  This was really freaking looking because I have really big eyes and looked fucking peaked, scared, and crazy.  I felt a loss of balance and almost similar to being drunk.  I stumbled around.  The clock kept moving forward, but the nausea would not abate.  I had visuals but no odd colors or hallucinations.  Everything seemed louder and sharper sounding.  When I was laying in bed my legs seemed really far away and I felt disconnected from my body.  I felt like I was a small soul lost in a huge body (somewhere behind my eyes.)  My body was very heavy and the ceiling and walls seemed very far away.  As I laid down in bed I felt like I was sunk deep in my pillow and my bed.  I guess my depth perception was fucked up.  But I was by no means comfortable.  All night long I felt nausea.  I wanted to just sleep through it--whatever trip I would go on, I did not care, it just wasnt worth it!  But it was really hard to sleep.  My thoughts were random, nothing scary.  I remember shaking.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Every now and then my jaw would start convulsing or shaking and wake me up.  Once my whole body convulsed, but one time it was not bad because I had a vaginal contraction similar to orgasm.  So I decided to try to masturbate.  (I figured the seeds would intensify my orgasm because of the muscle contration thing I talked about.  Not to mention after masturbating I basically get knocked out and fall asleep very quickly and deeply.)  So anyway, I tried but couldnt get off. . . Again I tried to fall back asleep.  My jaw was shaking all through the night.  <BR>
<BR>
I remember waking up scared.  I couldnt see right and my vision was really fucked up, everything was shaking and there were weird lights in my eyes.  It was about 4-5 hours after ingestion and I wondered if I would ever see or feel normal again. I told myself it would just pass and to stop worrying until I flitted out of consciousness again.  I wanted to die, I felt like shit.  My whole body was exhausted and I had pains in all my extremities.  I felt poisoned and stupid.  Why stupid?  Well, because all this pain I had put upon myself!  I wouldnt wish that on my worst fucking enemy.  Now I know why the stupid shit is legal--because to most people it is a bad experience that they will not want to go through again.  I just wanted to feel normal again.  <BR>
<BR>
Tossing. . .turning. . .pain. . .disorientation--that was my night.<BR>
<BR>
The next day I attempted to eat at about 10:00am  (almost 12 hours after first ingesting the seeds)  I was still semi-nauseous but the bagel I ate helped a little.  I stumbled around the house in a stupor that morning, trying to just look normal ( I live with my parents)  I then gave up and went back to bed.  I slept more until about 7:00pm that evening. <BR>
<BR>
I still felt weak and couldnt move or walk very fast.  I left any talking I had to do to a minimum.  *remember now, this was about 18 hours after ingestion!!*  I still felt weird and wondered why I hadnt shitted the seeds out yet.  I attempted to go to the bathroom many times but couldnt.  Eventually I did, with some trouble.  This is very uncommon to me because im vegan, and all that fiber makes digestion alot 'healthier'  if you know what I mean.  <BR>
<BR>
Right now it is about 10pm, almost 24 hours after I ate those stupid seeds, and I still feel a little weak and uncomfortable.  Only 3 hours ago did my vision even begin to go back to normal.  <BR>
<BR>
This experience has taught me not to fuck with substances and never to underestimate the power of it.  Everyone deals with chemicals differently, but I know I am not the only one who has had a bad experience with it.  If you want to try the seeds, that is up to you.  But I would recommend trying an extraction because of the extreme and long lasting nausea I felt.  Im not sure if I tripped, or if it is possible to sleep through a trip. . .either way I dont care!  I am just glad to get those seeds out of my body.  I felt poisoned.  <BR>
<BR>
Just thinking about the seeds, the pulp, or the applesauce, makes me want to fucking vomit!  I feel physically sick. . . I can almost taste it!  Yuck.  Anyways, I respect the power now, and in the future will not fuck with it.  This makes me rethink even shrooms or acid, because if any part of what I felt last night was tripping, I did not like it.  I vaguely remember pain, headache, convulsions, etc.  It was not pleasurable in the least.  But if you still want to try morning glory, good luck.  If you have a good experience, more power to you.  But me. . .I think im gonna plant the rest of these bad boys.<BR>
<BR>
All in all it was really glad, but it feels really good to be back to normal.  There does not exist instant happiness in a substance that you will not pay for later.  I take what I have, and make the best of it.  So in a way I did learn from it.<BR>

I procured a gram of AMT, and began a short but excessive binge. I have a lot of experience with the general psychedelics i.e. marijuana, lots of acid, and mushrooms, and was thinking I would give the Research Chemical thing a try, kinda reminiscent of the whole 1960's acid tests, where no one knew much about the stuff. So, here are three trips which, unfortunately were all in the course of three days.<BR>
<BR>
20 Mg. oral mixed in capsule with powdered ginger in hopes to ward off some of the nausea. Had no problems with nausea. <BR>
<BR>
t+2 hours- the caffeine-like stimulation expands into a very slight mdma like stimulation, though less euphoric, and the sense of a slight headtrip, similar to acid arise. <BR>
<BR>
t+4 hours- the stimulation becomes more euphoric, and continues on without much change.<BR>
<BR>
t+6 hours- more of a 2 hits of acid deal now, visuals apparent, and the headtrip is strong, although quite different from acid, the clarity of thought is much more akin to that which I get on MDMA, than on LSD, no insane thought trains, just enhanced clarity.<BR>
<BR>
t+10 hours-visuals are peaking, exactly the same as acid visuals. Lots of body load, but I like it, definately tolerable. I take a booster dose of about another 30mg. <BR>
<BR>
t+11-effects are very strong now, like taking 4 hits of acid, very speedy, very euphoric. try smoking, via chasing the dragon. trip even harder. Take a couple of small boosters. <BR>
<BR>
t+19-after tripping straight for 19 hours, the effects dwindle, and I make it to sleep. wake up tripping and trip till around 12:00 pm.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
next day, 40 mg oral taken before attending a rave, bad idea. The speediness and headtrip were so overwhelming combined with the body load. Strong visual effects again. take another booster of 40mg at around t+8 and am rewarded with a 5+ hits style trip, very nice listening to music, but a little edgy, cannot stop moving, lasts around another 10-11 hours again, and then I go to sleep. try smoking it a couple times, and the intensity increases a great deal. i found the the cev's to be incredible with this drug. lotsa fun. couple small 10 mg boosters. what the fuck, hey. <BR>
<BR>
Mind you, by the end of the first trip I was quite cracked out, but by the end of this 19 hour journey, I am officially the yolk-like spokesperson for anti-drug america, sizzling on my throne. I wake up with my body still moving.<BR>
<BR>
20 mg oral. followed by the same pattern of effects as the first experience, the same booster dose, and the same duration, did not notice a strong building of tolerance on AMT. <BR>
<BR>
Althought this drug is one of my favorite psychedelics, I would not revisit the repeated high doses descibed here. The physical affects of this endevour were horrible. I couldn't get up until 6:30 on the day after the last trip, and powerful lethargy was noticed for the entire week afterwards. My brain was officially fried for about 4 days, but especially the first day afterwards where I could not tell someone my zip code and eating was extremely painful from the tooth grinding which had made my gums sore. I saw residual visual effects for the next week as well, and found that moments where I laughed or got excited, suddenly it was like I was on the drug again and this explosive psychedelic energy burst through me like an electric current, but kinda like where I would think my brain was just going to go out like a 60 watt bulb in a streetlight socket, bang, it was very unpleasant to say the least. It was also quite disconcerting to see that I have no idea what i may have done. The hppd is annoying as shit when I see flourescent spots on everything all the time and things warp occasionally. well, its a great psychedelic, but moderate moderate moderate.<!--   End Body   -->

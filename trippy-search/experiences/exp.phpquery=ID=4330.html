I recently had heard about dimenhydrinate and thought I'd do some research.  It seemed interesting so I went and picked up 2 boxes of generic motion sickness medicine for three dollars!!  That was 24 pills.<BR>
<BR>
First Experience:  I did 6 pills, my trip-sitter bailed on me and I couldn't stand sobriety any longer, so I thought I'd try out this low dose.  Felt a little weird in ways I cannot describe, interesting CEV's that were very detailed and realistic.  Towards the end of the day I just wanted to lie down with my eyes closed (not sleep) and not talk to anyone.<BR>
<BR>
Second Experience:  One week later, 12 pills this time.  By myself, after the mild experience I had on 6 I felt no need for a trip-sitter, besides, I had done acid many a time and felt very comfortable tripping.  Most the things I expected didn't happen, most of this was good...<BR>
I didn't feel nausea<BR>
I didn't feel very heavy<BR>
I didn't feel drowsy<BR>
I didn't have a headache afterwards<BR>
I didn't lose track of memory or my mind<BR>
<BR>
What DID happen was very little actually, in comparison to stories of imaginary conversations with imaginary people... which DID happen, but only with eyes closed.  I did forget my eyes were closed a few times.  Sitting downstairs with eyes closed I found myself sitting upstairs with eyes open watching TV, my parents confronted me but I would not speak to them, for some reason I just refused.  This was all in my head.  Then I opened my eyes and saw my cat on a shelf a few feet away from me.  Then I realized my cat was on the other side of the room.  The cat on the shelf was thinner and had a longer neck, but it was completely realistic.  It strutted around the shelf, twitched it's tail, poked it's head out and stared at me, eyes blinking, breathing, so life-like it was incredible!  I stood up and took a step towards it, and it MORPHED into a book!  It was flawless... the eyes of the cat sank back and became the metal buttons on the binding of a book.  When I sat back down the cat re-appeared and jumped off the shelf, disappearing in thin air.  The next day I realized the book didn't exist either.  <BR>
<BR>
Contrary to what I had read, I not only didn't feel drowsy, but had a HORRIBLE time getting to sleep.  My legs felt weird, like they were itching on the inside, like growing pains from hell.  I tossed and turned for about an hour before I fell asleep, this was the only real unpleasant thing about the trip, not too bad.<BR>
<BR>
I went to school the next morning.  I didn't want to talk to anyone.  I just sat off by myself against the wall staring at an area in the carpet.  My friend said I looked fucked up, that my eyes looked like they were 'turning into cat eyes' (i loved the irony there!).  Within a few hours of school I felt completely back to normal, except for a slight uneasy feeling in my chest, somewhat like the one that accompanies the first signs of an acid body-high.  Overall it was worth it, definitely worth $1.50, though much less than I had hoped.  I think I'll wait several months and then try 20.  I saw no need for a trip-sitter, if I had tripped harder and lost my mind, I probably wouldn't have left the couch.<!--   End Body   -->

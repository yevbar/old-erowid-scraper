Feeling bored at around midnight I decided on impulse to cruise around in search of crack cocaine.  I’d tried crack in the past but only about twice and while intoxicated heavily by other drugs.  I also suspect my previous experience involved ‘dummy rock’ or fake crack.    I found the ‘dope spot’ where numerous people were huddled around and smoking crack.  I was excited and received a free hit from an experienced crack user.  I knew this was the real deal as it numbed my lips and made my heart race but for such a large hit I felt only slightly euphoric.   <br>
<br>
I proceeded to take hits with these two “generous” guys, no doubt they wanted to hook a newbie, but while they were clearly impaired mumbling and stumbling, I on the other hand only had a mild buzz after taking a couple huge hits but paid them and explained I’d smoke with them tonight.  I was now getting a little paranoid on the street in the middle of the night with cops buzzing now and again.  They suggested we go to my car and I was a little weary of this but anywhere was better than smoking in the street with the others pestering us and I was far away from my home.  Petrified of arrest but wanting to actually finally get really high from crack I drove around and we took turns hitting the pipe. <FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</FONT>  I still only got this mild euphoria with a lot of fast heart rate and increased paranoia.  I began to ponder with frustration why the stuff wouldn’t effect me like it does others.<br>
	<br>
The next morning safe and sound in my neighborhood I went to my car and searched around to find left over pieces of crack rock that had probably fallen on the floor of the car.  I found a small sliver and put it on the tip of my cigarette.  I carefully melted it into the tobacco ripped of the filter and sizzled a hit.  This time I was feeling incredible, the euphoria was strong and yet I also felt almost tired, definetly relaxed, I had to sit back for 5 minutes and not move.  About an hour later I started feeling terribly nervous and tired at the same time.  I pondered and pondered what was so different and realized probably the gabapentin had worn off so the crack hit me like it does other people.  I rushed, excitedly to the internet and found support for this hypothesis in the literature.  I hope I never do crack again because it feels great for a few minutes and leaves you feeling like shit for a day, and that’s with a small hit.<!--   End Body   -->

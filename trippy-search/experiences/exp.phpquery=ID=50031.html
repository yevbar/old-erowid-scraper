A little background on myself: I go to an excellent college and I'm a student-athlete with pretty good grades. I grew up in one of the richest communities and in the state where I live. So basically everyone smokes bud, even the most 'goodie-goodie rich girls' smoke and the most popular drugs are: oxycontin, percocet, vicodin, 2c-i, coke, meth, shrooms and MDMA.  I'm one of those kind of people who don't get negatively affected by drugs and alcohol and me and my close friends honestly consider ourselves not druggies, but rather 'good kids who like to have fun.'<BR>
<BR>
These are all of the chemicals/drugs I have experimented with: 2c-i (twice), cannabis (four + days a week), alcohol (twice a week), shrooms (twice), coke (ten times), dxm (once), nitrous (once), mdma (three times) and various pharms like: percocet, oxycontin, vicodin, darvocet, valium and xanax which are my favorite. Of all of the drugs I’ve done oxycontin combined with cannabis approximately two hours later gives me the greatest and most euphoric feeling ever.  Taking 2c-i after several drinks also is an overwhelming and extremely euphoric and trippy high. In my opinion nothing in the world feels as good as those substances PERIOD.<BR>
<BR>
At work today I made $300 in tips and I really wanted to get some oxy. I met one of my friends after work and he sold me two 80 mg pills for $100 and a half dub and some really good bud for $25. So then I called my friend/neighbor up and informed him that I would be at his house in 10 minutes and the fact that we would be getting really wild on oxy made him terribly excited.  <BR>
<BR>
I arrived at his house and a cops marathon was on! So I was like...a little oxy and cops tonight hells yeah!  So before taking the oxy the both of us made sure we were relaxed and laid back.  This is because being in the good frame of mind before taking a drug makes the experience much more enjoyable and positive.  <BR>
<BR>
8:00 P.M- So I grabbed one of the oxy's and peeled off the time release coating.  Then I broke/crushed up the pill with a lighter and credit card, then spilt the fine powder into two nice little lines (40 mg each).  We both did our lines at the same time. <BR>
<BR>
8:20 P.M.- Wow!!! I can't stop talking, conversations feel amazing, there's an overwhelming sense of euphoria and well being, my eyes are so blood shot! HAHAHA  I thought my friend was going to cry of joy, I’ve never seen him so mello and carefree in my life, he told that he felt as happy as 'an Asian in Disney land'-that was so funny. He kept thanking me and telling me how good he felt!<BR>
<BR>
9:20- We're still both feeling very euphoric and talkative. We're know watching cops and can't stop laughing at this one black drug dealer being searched and arrested. His shirt was off, the police then checked his pants and found crack and he claimed the he was holding the crack for a friend. Yeah right. HAHAHA. So then the police arrested him and the cop laid his face and body on the front of the cop car. Then he all of a sudden kept slamming his head on the car purposely, trying to blame the cops for it! After about the 7th time he slammed himself on the car, he looked at the camera with a this extremely funny grin on his face!  I have never laughed so hard in my life.<BR>
<BR>
10:20- Both still feeling pretty relaxed and euphoric, but we've both come done a little. So we decided that it would be a really good decision to go smoke a bowl.<BR>
<BR>
10:30- After smoking that bowl I have a very relaxed high now and the euphoria is back.  This is definitely a great combination!<BR>
<BR>
11:00- I leave by friend’s house walk home and then go to bed.<!--   End Body   -->

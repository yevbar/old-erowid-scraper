INTRODUCTION<br>
<br>
I am very experienced in using various substances over the years. I have done about half a dozen RC's, cocaine, ecstasy, marijuana, DXM, salvia, acid, ketamine, shrooms-- I could go on but you get the picture. Not to mention all the pharmaceuticals on top of all that. This was all through the ages of 18-25, and I have been drug-free since then.<br>
<br>
I didn't stop using drugs for any one reason as there were many. For one, I had to kick a pain killer habbit that really messed me up for years. Secondly, I enjoyed all my times but also was finished exploring myself for the time being. I wasn't anti-drug, but rather I was only going to try something new and only if the opportunity presented itself.<br>
<br>
Last week I received 100 grams of powdered san pedro. The dosage suggestions I could come to was about 40 grams of the powdered stuff. Now, I had researched cacti quite a bit and knew that dosages varied greatly, so I decided to take a trial run of about 15 grams last week by drinking it with liquid. The taste was horrible, as expected, and reminded me of kratom. I did get it down without issue, and within 20 minutes I was starting to feel the effects. About 90 minutes after ingesting, I couldn't hold it down anymore and puked violently.<br>
<br>
I did trip a bit though not too hard and it ended up being exactly what I had hoped for that taste test. I didn't get hardly any visuals at all and it was more just the energy and body load I got with time slowed to a crawl and psychedelic thoughts and analysis. I ended up coming down about 6 hours into it and was able to go to sleep without too much hassle.<br>
<br>
At this point I was excited as I really liked the feeling it had gave me. I couldn't wait for my full-blown experience on Cinco de Mayo! I really wanted to dig deep and go way over the suggested dose to see where this cacti could really take me. Little did I know, I would soon have my wish.<br>
<br>
PREPARATION<br>
<br>
I didn't want to drink almost 5 times as much powder as my little 15gram experience because it was disgusting and made me puke it up. I wanted to hold it down this time for sure, and let it take me for a true ride. I had bought some 000 size capsules the night before and prepped 105 capsules with my remaining 85 grams of powder. I had 53 capsules set aside for my trip. Now then, that was just about 42.5 grams of the powder, not 70, so where did my other dose come from? I'll get to that in the report!<br>
<br>
INGESTION<br>
<br>
I woke up on Cinco de Mayo at around 7:30am. By 8am I was already in the kitchin downing the 53 capsules one by one and finished them in an impressive 8 minutes (I don't have issues taking pills. My stomach was empty as I hadn't eaten in over 12 hours so I expected to start tripping fast. Unfortunately, this was not the case.<br>
<br>
Just over 2 hours later at around 10:15am, I started to get nervous as I didn't feel anything more than a bloated stomach from all of the gelcaps! I thought maybe the gelcaps somehow messed things up, and I recalled reading someone else online saying when they used gelcaps that they didn't trip that hard. I paniced and got 20-something more capsules out that I had packed from the night before, and emptied them into a glass and drank it by 10:45am. This was a whopping 2.5 hours after ingesting all my gelcaps, but my ride was just about to begin!<br>
<br>
EXPERIENCE<br>
<br>
T + 3 Hours<br>
<br>
I was definitely tripping now, but my main focus was on my stomach and not allowing myself to throw up. In hindsight, this was a feeling that stuck with me the entire trip. Colors were very bright and vivid, time came to a hault, I was analyzing everything in my environment and in my mind, let also had a huge positive vibe going on very reminicent of ecstasy.<br>
<br>
T + 4-13 Hours<br>
<br>
Unfortunately during the trip I didn't take any notes, so I am going to have to summarize everything I recall here.<br>
<br>
It seemed like everytime I had a bad thought come into my mind, I was able to move past it and cause a surge of positive vibes throughout my body. This is difficult to explain because it's difficult to put into words. There were many times throughout the experience that felt like my soul, or some point deep inside my chest area, was making itself known and it felt so great that all I could do was massage my chest and take in it's beautiful feelings. This was definitely NOT my stomach as this was coming from behind my ribs.<br>
<br>
Everything had so much going on geometrically. I could see lines, angles, and grids all over anything and everything with texture- It was like I was in The Matrix or something.<br>
<br>
During the whole 15 hour experience, I split my time between taking my dog outside in the back yard, watching some tv, and surfing the internet on my computer. Although I would have loved to have been at some nature park all day, I really don't want to risk getting into any trouble, so I had to make due that way.<br>
<br>
I was having tracers like crazy in everything I was looking at. Birds flying outside seemed to move so fast yet so slow because I could see individual frames of them in different positions as they pass. On TV, everything would have so many residual tracers that I thought something was wrong. Everything and everyone on the TV looked so 2D, cartoony, and fake. It was like everyone on screen was a cutout board somehow. On the computer, I could spend many minutes just moving the mouse around and it reminded me of being in school back in the day and turning mouse trails on.<br>
<br>
Speaking of the computer, YouTube had so many amazing videos. No matter what video I watched, I could find amazing things that I really liked about it. I would watch lots of fractal videos, music videos-- Everything! It was all so awesome and yet overwhelming at the same time. All the other video thumbnails on the pages would start playing even though they were clearly just screenshots!<br>
<br>
When I would walk around my house, I felt really disconnected from my body, like I was on DXM. It was amazing because I felt like a giant who had his legs and body moving all by itself, so you would expect me to be clumsy, yet I was not. When I would look in the mirror, my whole body would seem to get really big, then really small. My pupils would grow bigger than my entire eyeball, then when I'd focus in they'd be a little smaller yet still huge. My expression would change from happy to angry to sad yet I wasn't moving a single muscle in my face! Warm colors would popup in the background then disappear, as if there were spotlights around me.<br>
<br>
I would look at some pictures online and they would completely morph and shift into completely different pictures magically on their own. Their colors would change and change the whole feeling the picture would give off to me as well.<br>
<br>
My small dog was loving all the rubdowns and attention I was giving her. It was so much fun to massage and pet her, and she was loving every minute of it.<br>
<br>
The whole trip I was hungry and at one point I made a sandwich and was able to eat it without issue, though it felt really weird to be chewing and swallowing something, and by the time it was in my mouth I wasn't too interested in it anymore. Though I did eat it just to hopefully settle my stomach down.<br>
<br>
At one point a very small thunderstorm came out of nowhere and it was beautiful. I really wanted to go out in the rain but my neighbors would have thought I was on something so I didn't risk it.<br>
<br>
END OF THE NIGHT<br>
<br>
About 8 hours in, I was really ready for the whole thing to be over with. I was still tripping VERY hard, but I felt like I had enough. The tension in my neck and the rear of my skull had really been getting to me, like a huge headache, and I was ready to come down, eat dinner, and go to sleep. That wouldn't be the case, though, as the cacti seemed to push me even further into the trip until about Midnight. From Midnight until 2am I was still tripping hard, but was getting tired. The visuals weren't quite as amazing or magical as they had seemed earlier. I took a couple of sleeping pills, as I normally do, and laid down in bed. It was pretty difficult to get to sleep for the first hour because the CEV's were extremely fantastical, magical, and way too crazy to fall asleep to. They weren't negative or bad, but they were so amazing that they took so much of my focus.<br>
<br>
Finally I was able to fall asleep but I did wake up just about every 90 minutes and look at the clock. I finally got up at exactly Noon this morning and headed out to get a huge meal- I was starving! That meal was great and now I'm typing this story.<br>
<br>
CONCLUSIONS<br>
<br>
I don't really know what to conclude. I love how I feel 100% normal and sober without any hangover whatsoever. Driving to get lunch today felt a little awkward but it wasn't bad.<br>
<br>
I had an absolutely stunning experience, to say the least! The other psychedelics I have a lot of experience with are LSD and shrooms, as mentioned before. I always thought shrooms could be fun yet also dark at times, though still overall enjoyable. LSD I always thought the more I took, the more I'd enjoy it (I was never really into the experience too much) and the last time I took about 4 hits of paper and a couple liquid hits and it was so intense I never recalled anything from that night.<br>
<br>
I would definitely say, without a doubt, that mescaline is way better than acid or shrooms to me. It has a very earthy feel to it, feels a lot less forced than LSD, and overall more pleasant. It really makes you think a lot about yourself, who you are, and what you can improve on as an individual. I had many of these thoughts yesterday myself. Everyone is different, and some will still love their acid, I suppose. But for me, mescaline is the way to go!<br>
<br>
It's really mind-blowing to me that such a powerful substance is readily available. I just hope it stays that way!<!--   End Body   -->

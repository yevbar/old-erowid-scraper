I found this story written in a notebook I found while walking home yesterday.<BR>
<BR>
I was hanging out with two friends, A and B. All of us have had substantial past experience with vicodin, alcohol, and cannibis, and each of us had tried Salvia at least a couple times. I have smoked Salvia around 7 times, and broken through probably about 4 times. We have all also had tried shrooms in the past.<BR>
<BR>
I take a vicodin at around 2:00, feeling the mild hydrocodone buzz for a couple hours afterwards. My friends A and B take theirs an hour or so after me, around 3:00. We decide around 5:00 to go do salvia sometime that night. By 7:00 we are at our location to get buzzed then smoke the salvia. First we each take a couple shots, as in our past experiences with Salvia getting an alcohol buzz on helped 'break through'. A and B are still feeling the vicodin they have taken earlier, but mine has faded off. We each take two shots of 90-proof whiskey.<BR>
<BR>
Being mildly drunk, we all feel ready to trip out like crazy on salvia. So at around 7:30, I first pack a bowl of 7x extract, hoping to snap it in one hit and hold it in. After my first breath I see most of the bowl left, and end up finishing it in a few short breaths, forgetting to hold any of them in, then for a moment worrying I wasted a bowl by not holding my hits in. Then, as any full salvia experience goes for me, I'm completely tripping out, feel like I'm peaking on a hallucinogen without the hour or more come-up phase of most, and lean back. I won't go into specifics describing my trip because that's not why I felt I should leave this experience report. But yes, it did work on me once again. So, now tripping like all hell, I turn and see A to my right letting his hit out. I'm tripping out so my time perception is off, but sometime within the minute or two my friend B, to my left, is smoking his bowl. While A and I are freaking out like anyone really 'feeling' their salvia does, B seems unsatisfied and smokes another bowl.<BR>
<BR>
The three of us sit there, saying sporadic meaningless drug-induced phrases, then B says he doesn't think he felt it so he packs one more bowl and smokes it, then begins walking around trying to 'trip out'. A and I, both very fucked up but coming slightly back to reality now (it had probably been about 5 minutes since we started tripping, so we're a little more sane now), see our friend going right into his trip and start dancing around, you know, having fun thinking he's farther into outer space than us.<BR>
<BR>
After settling down for a good 30 minutes to let the trips calm down, we decide we should head back to my car before it gets too dark. <FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</FONT> B was apparently a little let down in the lack of mind-blowing visuals, but did admit he was fully tripping out, which he had to have been, considering he smoked so much more than A or I and we were for sure.<BR>
<BR>
So anyway, about two hours later, by like 9:00, we finally find somewhere to hang out. A, B, and I meet with a third friend, C, to go smoke pot in a field. We stand in a circle and C packs bowls in his small pipe. We each get about 5-6 good hits of the pot. At this point I'm not feeling near as stoned as I usually would, but I know it's only because I'm so 'out of it' from having smoked salvia earlier in the day. <BR>
<BR>
At about 9:30, mid-smoking session, B says to me 'Man, I'm so stoned.... I'm getting trails' and we all sort of notice. Then he says 'I'm really so fucked up' and I say 'I wonder why', in reference to the fact that it's likely the 3 bowls of salvia he'd smoked a couple hours earlier and all the pot. This is when things went BAD. He swings his arm and begins falling backwards, looking like he's trying to stand up, so he falls and 'running' steps backwards in a 10-foot circle, the whole time the three of us yelling at him, things like 'are you okay?' and his name, and I was telling him to 'sit down!' because he seemed to be resisting passing out by running backwards and trying to stand up.<BR>
<BR>
He then falls to the ground, mumbles something, then tries to stand up again. He says 'I'm sooo dizzy' or something like that, then it all happens again, the flailing, the falling. So he's on the ground, lying on his back, his head fell directly on top of some hard trash on the ground. We yell his name but he doesn't respond, but as soon as he hits the ground his eyes and mouth open, making a face C described as 'if he'd just seen the worst thing ever and died'.<BR>
<BR>
C put his hand over B's chest to see if his heart was beating, and luckily at this point it was. After about a minute he closed his eyes and then 'came back to life'. He stood up, but I made him sit down and sat there with him. <BR>
<BR>
He said when he had started to get dizzy he wasn't tripping out or flashing back to salvia or anything, he just instantly felt so fucked up and completely out of control. Seeing him move like that then fall terrified me. Seeing drugs do something like that to my friend made me instantly see all of the dangers of drugs in my head in a new, more realistic light.<BR>
<BR>
After about 15 minutes, we felt safe enough to walk back to the car. I followed B home that night, to make sure it didn't happen again while he drove.<BR>
<BR>
For a moment, A, C, and I had all thought B might be dead. The way he was acting right before he passed out was so fucked up, so inhuman, it looked like he was dying. Then seeing him lie there, eyes open, face stuck in terror, unresponsive...<BR>
<BR>
But now I feel I must post this on here, because that definitely wouldn't have happened had we not done salvia earlier in the day, and it was the scariest thing any of us had seen. We thought our friend had DIED. Salvia definitely seems to be more dangerous and risky than we were treating it, and hopefully someone reading this will be more cautious in using this POWERFUL and possibly dangerous drug.<BR>
<BR>
Hopefully this won't happen to anyone else. But that's just wishful thinking, I know.<!--   End Body   -->

'Dude, you gotta try this' is the usual response to this cheap and easy (and legal) super trip through life, and seemingly beyond.  I was trying to give up 'the tabs' in an effort to clean up my lifestyle - it seemed like a good vice to start with - so I got loads of nicotine gum, nicorette patches and so on. At one stage I had four patches on my left arm. At another I had just stuck two on, and started to feel drowsy. I fell asleep. <BR>
<BR>
REM sleep must have hit, and with it, the slow release of around 40 marlbro's worth of nicotine. A vast cinematic experience followed, like a dream but like I was viewing someone else's dream. But I recognised various landmarks and symbols and faces and soon realised that this was my own subconscious I was walking around in. With some kind of instinct, I took control of this landscape I was in (a sub-conscious rendering of my home town newport) and began to play with it. I started flying because I just wanted to, (it was actually the same sense experience as swimming - but through the air this time!). I also summoned people from my past I had not seen for a long time and was shocked at how accurate their rendering was, since I had thought I had forgotten what these people had looked like. <BR>
<BR>
The only truly awe inspiring moment for me though was when I realised I didn't have to be located in just one dream so I switched the whole backdrop of my mind to the Akihabara district of Tokyo - a place I had been years before. It felt great to be back amongst the rabit-warren of electrical shops again!<BR>
<BR>
I woke myself up that night. A conscious decision to awake and write everything I saw and did, down, on my note pad, which still gets me giggling when I read it.<!--   End Body   -->

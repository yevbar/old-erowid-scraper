I have heard good things about a 2C-E and LSD combo, and seeing as there is not that much information on it I decided that I would try it. I am very glad I did, these substances work together incredibly well together.<br>
<br>
I begin by dosing 2 hits followed by a gel cap full of 2C-E containing 16mgs. Within a half hour my pupils were beginning to dilate, and I was beginning to feel the drugs coming on. At this point I left the inside to venture around outside on a walk with friends. Over the next hour or so I walked around with my friends. I was seeing slight trails off of almost any movement, and it seemed like my body was the wrong size. Everything was beautiful. I could not help by look at all the vibrant colors around me. As I was sitting on the grass about two hours after dosing, the most significant part of my trip began.<br>
<br>
My experience is almost impossible to put into words. I was tripping at two hours in incredibly hard. Yet it was almost as if I was sober. I was not seeing that much in the way of visuals, but it was as if my brain was operating on almost an entirely new level. I was in this world, all the time, yet I it was as if my mind was operating on a whole new level. Time existed because I wanted it to. It was almost as if I was a God. I sat on the grass and at the same time I was everywhere, everything, everyone. I felt such a great sense of power it was amazing. This power however just was. I felt happy just sitting, still enjoying the beauty around me.<br>
<br>
I was able to maintain this state of mind for around another two hours. At this point (around four hours after dosing) I was beginning to become a little less high. I was able to begin to attempt to communicate on a regular level, and I was trying to communicate the experience I was having with the people around me. I left with a few other friends to a coffee shop. I got into a huge debate with a friend. At the time I made perfect sense. Yet I was talking in huge abstractions and things that I said now are very hard to make sense of. All I can describe the state I was in was one of higher functioning. I was able to use and understand any abstract concept or idea. I was still stuck in this state, just not as much as before.<br>
<br>
After leaving the coffee shop about a half hour later, I slowly began to return more and more to reality, and my normal state of mind. I ended the night smoking pot and was able to bring my self  back into the state of mind just a little bit. This was about six hours after dosing. I was finally able to fall asleep around 4:30 AM after dosing at 2:00 PM.<br>
<br>
Overall this experience was a very hard one to describe. I saw almost no visuals the entire duration of the trip, which is strange because 2C-E and LSD are usually incredibly visual substances for me. I saw slight trails almost the entire trip. But none of the complexing patterning, melting, etc. that I usually see on these two drugs. Yet this is one of the most amazing psychedelic experiences I have ever had in my entire life. The state that my mind was in was an amazing one. I remember feeling like I was in a place mentally that should have taken me years of meditation and self reflection to reach. I definitely wish to try this combo with higher doses. Being completely lost in the state of mind I was would be an even more moving and introspective experience. I was still able to reach deep into my own psyche, and begin to de-construct and analyze the reality we all live in, I felt like I was truly functioning on another level.<!--   End Body   -->

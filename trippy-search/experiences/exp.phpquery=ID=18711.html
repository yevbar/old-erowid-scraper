I'm writing about this dream, and posting it here because it seems different (more simplistic from what I gather) from most of the experiences I've read or heard about. As one might imagine, I've forgotten many of the details of my dream. However, for some strange reason, I was talking to my friend/sitter/brewmeister (who I like to call the shaman in a semi-jestful but respectful way) during parts of the experience. As a result, I have written notes, some that bring back interesting memories, others that have apparently vanished and taken some brain cells with them.<BR>
<BR>
I began sipping the Syrian Rue slurry (3 grams) at 10:05pm on the night in question. The mixture wasn't yummy, but seemed reasonable enough and I finished it about 20 minutes later. I can't say that I felt too much from the Rue other than a slight warmth. I relaxed for a while, eating some olive bread with olive oil, and mentally preparing for the Mimosa hostilis root bark tea. At 11:13pm I began sipping the tea. I actually didn't mind the taste initally and thought I wouldn't have a problem. However, after drinking about 2/3 of the tea, I was feeling pretty uneasy about finishing it. By 11:38pm, I had pretty much given up and was ready to go with about 5-6 grams of MHRB. I felt a distinct warmth and slight nausea that seemed to be growing steadily.<BR>
<BR>
Between 11:45pm and midnight, I took a couple of fruitless trips to the bathroom in an attempt to vomit. I had begun to see some CEVs, colorful from what I remember, but not really clear in my mind due to the bad feeling in my stomach. At 12:07am, I staggered into the bathroom, and saw several black children waiting for me. I felt as though they were friends, and were encouraging me to just throw up. I did. I must admit that it was quite comforting to have them there.<BR>
<BR>
At 12:20am, I told my sitter that I saw a bunch of cattle walking down a country road, being led by a hispanic looking man wearing a white hat. It was a serene setting and I remember feeling very happy to be there. Apparently I also mentioned something about elephants, sheep, and some sort of digitization, but I don't remember this. I saw an amazing claymation scene, where two children (one boy, one blonde girl with pigtails) were riding bicycles on a path made of little colorful clay dots. I had the impression that there were levels of reality. For example, I remember thinking that the cattle and herder were obviously part of the ayahuasca experience, but I really believed that I was actually standing on a country road (I found this to be very dream-like).<BR>
<BR>
I felt like I was constantly ending up in different places. There was a farm woman handing me things, then I was in a field of grass with the sun shining, then in a desert with large spiky plants. Then I saw a tiger in some asian-looking place with a stream, an unmoving samurai, and snakes. I started hugging the tiger and it seemed very comforting.<BR>
<BR>
My sitter noted that it was 12:50am at this point. I saw temples everywhere, but everything seemed very enclosing and small. I distinctly remember the strange scene where there were long bamboo skewers (about 6 feet long), with the remains of fish on them. Next to the skewers, there was an old woman opening a wicker coffin/phone booth. I was in some sort of Southeast Asian villiage with water everywhere, and houses on stilts.<BR>
<BR>
Then, I ended up in India (or at least that's what I thought), inside a tall spire, with intricate carvings. I had incredible control of my movement inside this spire, like I could get closer, farther, turn, all in an instant. My sitter mentioned 'rings of trees', but that information is gone. At this point, she went to the bathroom, and I saw what I considered to be the most fascinating vision of them all. I was lying under what seemed to be a greenhouse of some sort, and creatures with the head of a frog and the body of a human were flying down at me from above, spitting a greenish-yellowish goo on the top of the greenhouse. It was oozing between the cracks and down the sides of the greenhouse...amazing.<BR>
<BR>
I told my friend that I felt I had been different races during the trip, Asian, Hispanic, Black. The last visual memory I have is seeing a childhood friend wearing a hard orange baseball hat (sort of like a construction worker hat), playing baseball with a stick.<BR>
<BR>
As I started to return to 'this' world, wherever that is, I continued to have a lot of interesting thoughts that were never written down, and that I don't remember. In fact, I didn't fall asleep for quite a while, and had a very enjoyable night just 'dreaming'.<BR>
<BR>
While I found the entire experience enjoyable, I also was concerned that it was mostly visual for me. I have the feeling that I've 'dumbed down' something that should be a intense, mystical, and enlightening experience. I wonder if I need to analyze my dream more, or if there is additional preparation that I should do. Whatever the case, I hope to partake in this wonderful (not tasting) brew once again.<!--   End Body   -->

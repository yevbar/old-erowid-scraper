Earlier this year I had heard that freon gives a wicked buzz and makes you hallucinate. This was just the beginning of my problems.<br>
<br>
My dad works on ac units he has large tanks of freon sitting around all over. After about a month of getting familiar with the gas I knew exactly how much to breath and when I would spend hours in my basement watching people walk by and strange figures dancing around the walls. Later I found that if I put headphones on and listen to 'stoner' music the effects were much more intense and colorful. As I increased the dose of freon it seemed as though I was god and was able travel anywhere and understand anything. Of course I had some bad trips like the house burning down and blood spewing out of my chest, but usually they were amazing and liberating. <br>
<br>
It all ended one day after I wrecked my car. I was upset and just wanted to get away. After about an hour of tripping I decided to just take a big hit and let the lights go out for a while. passing out was common with freon. I took two deep breaths and was out but something was wrong I felt my body slowly dying it was something I never felt before suddenly I was standing in front of my body punching it and holding on to it because it felt as though somebody was pulling me away. The terror lasted forever I really thought I was dead and my 'conscious' self was actually my soul apart from my body. Finally I came too but I couldn't move I couldn't see straight. I just laid on the floor for at least 15 minutes trying to understand what happened. I crawled upstairs to my bed and crashed. The next day I vowed never to do freon again and I haven't.<!--   End Body   -->

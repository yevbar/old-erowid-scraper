<!--   Start Body   -->


After recently arriving in Japan to visit some mates, I was able to acquire a reasonable quantity of 5-MeO-DMT and DPT. Having just finished university for the end of year break, a friend of mine from my raving days back in Melbourne gave me a call and mentioned he had some Amanita Pantherina mushrooms but no-one to try them with so we set aside an afternoon the following week to give them a go. <BR>
<BR>
I had tried Amanita Muscaria mushrooms before and had heard good things about Pantherina ones so I was looking forward to the experience. In the coming week I decided I would also like to try DPT (Intramuscular) and 5-MeO-DMT (Intravenous) and knew my friend would be up to the challenge. I didn't plan on having all three at the same time, it just kind of happened. The research chems market is still booming here but looks to collapse in the near future so I thought I should try them while I still could get pure product rather cheaply (and also because I am still too young to buy alcohol here and was getting a bit bored sitting at home!). I prepared the DPT (100mg) using table salt and sterile water because I didn't have saline. I only used sterile water for the 5-MeO-DMT (100mg) but I think that may have been a mistake. The DPT was easy but I found it very hard to get the 5-MeO-DMT to go into solution without destroying it with heat. By the look of it when it did go into solution I think it may be more soluble in an oil-based liquid because the water got that 'oil slick' film on the surface, but I dont know of one that could be put into the bloodstream safely. <BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I managed to prepare them both using sterile equipment and bought enough syringes to last the night. NB. I used table salt but I dont recommend it because it is DEFINATELY not sterile and cotton poisoning or something more serious could occcur. <BR>
<BR>
My friend arrived and we proceeded to eat 6 largish caps each of the Mushrooms and then went for a walk. As we looked around the shops and talked shit to each other for a while we both noticed we were getting very thirsty and went into a nearby McDonalds to get a drink. We sat in the McDonalds and drank 3 large Cokes each and smoked lots of cigarettes. I was finding it difficult not to look very fucked up so I suggested we go home and take it easy. It was difficult to walk and my friend and I were getting annoyed at how long it was taking to get points across when conversing. We just kept saying the same thing over again in different ways because we thought the other wasn't understanding what was trying to be said. <BR>
<BR>
We got home and listened to 1200 Micrograms' 'Ecstacy' on repeat for like 20 mins then decided that while the feeling was nice, it just wasn't as overwhelming as we were expecting. That said, we didn't feel that we could do anything with the feeling even if it was intensified so we didn't eat anymore and decided to try some 5-MeO-DMT. I had already tried the material earlier that day to be sure that I wanted to recommend the drug to my mate and had a very positive experience. My friend was a little apprehensive about injecting it into his veins so I injected the material into the muscle in the back of his calf instead (4mg). It took about 5 mins to start coming on at which point I injected it into the vein in my right arm (6mg). I was surprised at how much this material hurt going into the vein and for a about an hour or so after. I don't know why this would be, but I found it difficult to straighten my arm for quite a while and my friend found it difficult to walk. <BR>
<BR>
After injecting the material there is a moment before it starts top come on where I think, FUCK! What the hell am I doing! But after repeated experiences that moment becomes more of a FUCK! It's not going to work this time! As much as I hope my grandparents never know I ever thought that, it's the truth.<BR>
<BR>
My entire visual world dissolves and my body is overcome with an intense wave of pleasure which with higher doses turns into intense shivers (like when my jaw chatters on MDMA but much more intense). The entire world ripples like when you throw a pebble into a pond. It is difficult to walk and most motor function is lost. The onset is very quick and overwhelming so I had to be especially careful to get the needle out of my body and cover it with a tissue etc ASAP. I could see my friend was enjoying himself so I was free to explore, but I wanted to lay down. I got on my bed and rolled around on the doona and gripped it really hard and bit into it with my teeth. I felt so warm and safe, like a baby. I wouldn't change anything about the drug. It was the beautiful. I smoked a few cigarettes and talked with my friend and it gradually started to wear off. This was probably the most fun part of the experience because I was used to the feeling and I knew I had peaked and it wasn't going to get anymore intense. Music was great and tried having a dance, was kindly asked to stop by my mate because he hoped that if he ever danced like that I would stop him, for his sake. <BR>
<BR>
We went out to McDonalds again still feeling a bit fucked from the mushrooms etc. Since I had asked the lady behind the register why Happy Meals were ending (there was a sign up), we thought it might be funny to go in and order exactly the same things as before and ask exactly the same questions to the same girl without acknowledging we'd been in before. We did so and 5 mins later she came up to our table and asked us if we had come in twice. At this point we burst out laughing and spilled food drink everywhere and left to 'save face'. <BR>
<BR>
We got home and I told my mate I had some other shit to try but not very much, so if we wanted to do it properly, we'd have to inject it intramuscularly. He agreed and I drew up the DPT. I injected us both (him in the other calf and me in the abdomen, 35mg each) and we waited for it to come on. Everything looked green and we had cool tracers and both started screaming 'I can see the music!' ala Simpsons. We lay down on the bed and talked shit about people who shit us and how evil cigarettes are (both while chain smoking). We then started talking about how we should have video taped the session like we used to back in Australia and how funny it would look both of us saying 'Midori! Midori!' (Green! Green!). This sent us into unstoppable laughter which caused my mate to throw up in the kitchen sink. <BR>
<BR>
After he calmed down we then both tried the 5-MeO-DMT intravenously (Me 8mg and my friend 5mg) and had the most exquisite feeling of being a baby in its mothers womb. I felt so calm, safe and warm while at the same time seeing the most outrageous visuals. We were lying down and laughing hysterically about really straight people we knew and what it would feel like to them if they were suddenly overcome with this feeling while riding a bus or something. <BR>
<BR>
After an hour or so I tried 10mg intravenously which was very fun but I can't really remember much of it. I also bit my mate on the shoulder which I can remember doing but not why I did it. He got a big mark and it looks like a love bite, it was fucking perfect because he had a date with his new girlfriend who doesn't take drugs at all the next day! We tried to think of a believable excuse but could only come up with 'I got hit with a rubber arrow doing archery'. I then gave my mate 8mg intramuscularly and he packed up and got the train home, which was apparently an extremely funny ride.<BR>
<BR>
Overall it was a very positive experience but I wouldn't recommend anyone taking the dosages we did unless they know what they are doing.<BR>
<BR>
Two thumbs up!<BR>
<BR>
BTW. I am taking Venlafaxine and Omeparazole [ulcer medication] atm. My mate isn't taking anything.<!--   End Body   -->

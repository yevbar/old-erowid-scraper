I had my first, possibly my last, nutmeg trip a few weeks after my first experience with cannabis. I had read many reports on nutmeg, and many sources (Such as the Anarchists Cookbook and Licit and Illicit Drugs) state it as being a halluocenagen, But it wasn't until my friend M told me that he had tried it first hand that I decided to give it a whirl. M said he had bought 2 whole nutmegs and ground them up with yogurt and described the effects (quite vaguely) as being 'Blurred out'. Which I took to mean 'Stoned'.<br>
<br>
For a bit of background information, I'm 17, I live and work in the states and am a highschool graduate. My only other encounters with drugs have been pills, Effexor and Tamzamedapan, alcohol and, at the time, one encounter with pot. I have wanted to try mushrooms and LSD (if they still make it) for the longest time but I have sadly never had the chance.<br>
<br>
On to the experience, I had wanted to buy a little more weed, but the buddy who sold it to me wasn't answering the phone, so I had decided now was as good a time as any to go on a nutmeg trip as my mom and her boyfriend were at a bar and wouldn't be home for hours. I had bought a jar of nutmeg from Eddie's Grocery and brought it home at about 3 o'clock AM, I emptied half the jar into some plain unflavoured yogurt, just as my buddy M had done, and ate the whole mess as fast as I could, the taste was tolerable, but it was still nutmeg.<br>
<br>
I knew the effects took a while to come on, so I hadn't done much but watch T.V and surf the web. I was relaxed, my expectations for this trip were hallucinations, religous visions, CEVs and so forth, as I had thought nutmeg was a psycadelic. I was wrong. at around 6PM I started feeling dull. Not stoned or drunk but just blunt and spaced out, sort of like a strong nicotine buzz. It was not pleasant, I layed down in bed and stared at the ceiling, closed my eyes and looked for geometric patterns, I saw nothing. I just lied there as the feeling of turning to wood got more and more intense. <br>
<br>
I felt lethargic and unable to move, I knew the drug was beginning to take it's terrible effect. Suddenly my mobile rang, it was starteling, and I was afraid it might be work asking me to come in, something I was not in the right condition for. It turned out to be my friend B asking if I wanted some weed. I told him I'd totally love some, hoping it would get me out of my nutmeg -induced hell. He said I'd have to some over to the pub and socialize a bit, and he'd give me a little homegrown.<br>
<br>
I put on my clothes and suddenly, like the floodgates had been opened, I was more stoned than I had even been in my life. I felt depersonolized as though I had a wet towel wrapped around my head. I knew I couldn't meet B for the pot, because if I had to go to a pub and socialize I would probably be commited right now. I called back B and told him I ill, that I thought I'd come down with the flu, when I hung up the phone I wasn't sure if I really had talked to him, I checked my calls log to make sure.<br>
<br>
At this point in time I was pretty sure I hadn't even reached the plateu of the nutmeg yet, and I wasn't liking the coming up too much. I ran to the bathroom trying to puke it up (Which seemed like a good indea) I stuck my fingers down my throat, retched and gagged, but nothing came up. I knew I had no choice but to, as I phrased it in my mind right then and there: 'Ride this strange torpedo out to the end'.<br>
<br>
I didn't know anything about bad trips or bad highs, if I had known then what I know now I would have put on some music and sat down until I was calm, I would've just went with it instead of hoping it would be over soon. Instead kept pacing around my room with an intense feeling of nervousness and anxiety that I couldn't shake off. At this point (I don't know the time, I didn't know much of anything at that moment) I decided it would be best to sleep things off, and that's when things got really bad.<br>
<br>
My eyes were red as hell and made a scratching sound when I blinked. My mouth was beyond cotton mouth, it was as though my tounge was made of wax paper and my saliva glands had gone on strike, even holding water in my mouth didn't provide relief from this feeling. Falling asleep was made more difficult by a feeling that I was unable to breathe unless I concentrated on it. Every time my mind wandered, I felt like I was suffocating. Emotionally, I was very depressed, I felt like a failure, every screw-up and disappointment of my life had come in to parade around my bed.<br>
<br>
Finally at midnight my mom and her boyfriend had gotten home, She was drunk and almost in as bad a shape as I was. She said she had run in to B at the pub and he told her I said I was sick, which I confirmed. Her voice sounded distorted, like she was speaking from far away, and I could just barely remember what she had said.<br>
<br>
I went to sleep briefly and woke up at 3AM only to realize to my horror that I was still JUST AS STONED as I had been, at this point I had my first and only real visual hallucination, I looked at my hands and they were outlined in the darkness with some sort of green electric energy pattern, this effect disappeared when I moved my hands. I got back to sleep after some momentary worry about when this would be over.<br>
<br>
I woke up the next moring, still buzzed but it wasn't as noticable, I didn't have to go into work that day. I felt nauseas and picked up the bucket next to my bed (which I didn't remember bringing in, but I knew it was there) and puked up, to my suprise, pure, raw, brown nutmeg, probably about as much as I had eaten. For pretty much the whole day, I stayed in bed until about 4 in the afternoon. I told my mom I had to flu and felt tired, She let me rest. For the next two days I still felt out there, but a lot less tired and a little more focused.<br>
<br>
I know there are some people who like nutmeg and think it's a drug meant solely for themselves, I don't doubt that it works for them. I am pretty sure I overdosed and that's what caused my bad time, if I do try nutmeg again I was probably only ingest 10 to 15 grams. But I don't think I'll try it again for a long, long time.<!--   End Body   -->

<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: 90 mgs of 2C-E and 2C-I is considered an extremely high dose, see 2C-E and 2C-I Dose Charts]</FONT> <br>
<br>
The day started out for me just fine. i had plans to go to the download festival in California that night and I was going to take my favorite hallucinogen, 2-CE. I had the powder in gel caps in my pocket somewhere around 20 mg. when i got home from school there was a cop in my driveway. i came in the house and was immediately arrested and had a bag of weed thrown in my face.<br>
<br>
I was on probation at the time and hadn't remembered that my room could be searched without a warrant. I was immediately searched and I was so happy I had dropped the pill outside as soon as I saw the cop. I was un-cuffed and had quite a bit of community service hours tacked onto my probation and not to mention I wasn't going to any concerts that night.<br>
<br>
At this point I decided I would call my friend 'John'ù and get more drugs in return for the ticket I would give him. He decided it was a fair trade and gave me 30 mg of 2-CE and 60 of 2-CI. The brightest idea I had all night was to mix it all into one bottle. I took the drugs at about 7:00 PM. At about 7:30 my pupils began to dilate in a way that I had only seen when taking acid or large quantities of mushrooms.<br>
<br>
7:45 the trip begins. I had strong nausea that I could not begin to comprehend. If I had not taken the drug before I would be afraid but I had and knew if I threw up I would be better. But first I decided I would have dinner. Walking into the brightly lit kitchen I saw my father at the stove. I asked him what time dinner was and he said 'Now, get a plate.'ù this was just about all I remember saying for the whole night to either one of my parents even though I vaguely recall spitting off a lot of bad jokes and laughing at them hysterically.<br>
<br>
Even though all of this was going on at about 8:30 I was back in my room and tripping hard. Though still coherent enough to put on a TV disk (That 70's Show). The show seemed to be a whole new thing even though I had seen each episode about a hundred times before. I decided that it would be just as entertaining as going to look in my mirror. I saw my face and burst out laughing. My eyes were so dilated that they looked like black dimes. My face had gone flushed red and I couldn't help but feel I was looking through a magnifying glass.<br>
<br>
I went to my backyard for a cigarette. It had gotten dark outside and I was feeling good. I decided that it would be a good idea to walk across the yard and sit on a large pile of dirt that was back there. When I reached the other end on my large, flat backyard I realized the trip had taken me near to 25 minutes to walk less than a Ω of an acre. I looked down at the pile of dirt which looked much larger than usual and I began to ask it many probing questions of why that particular pile of dirt was my destination. Though it did not answer I laughed and laughed as though it had cracked an amazing joke.<br>
<br>
At that point I sat down and lit another cigarette. (with a short note at this juncture, cigarettes on this drug seem to be about the consistency of paper. They taste different are very harsh and burn very quickly. I will be tripping for a long time and will smoke well above my average amount so I have to curb it or my mouth will taste like an ashtray when I finally fall asleep.) I stared up at the tree. Along with everything else it appeared funny as well and I once again began to talk to it. My father came outside. As I heard him try to sneak out the door I quickly got out my cell phone, called my friend, lets call her Ally, and began talking to her like we had been talking for an hour. The magical thing about this drug is when someone is near me that cant see me tripping I am capable of acting totally normal even in their eyes. Its just really hard not to laugh. After we talked I sent him away and told ally goodbye. I began talking to the tree again! After my one sided conversation I went inside and looked at the clock. It was 11:00 and my family was asleep. I turned on the television and decided to watch of all things mouse hunt. This was the come down part and I knew it even at this high dose.<br>
<br>
My brother came in the room and sat down. We talked through the whole movie making jokes and shit like that and had never gotten along so well in our lives. Though he is straight edge so I wasn't going to tell him I was frying balls. Though I could tell that he knew I was acting differently he couldn't place his finger on it and let it roll of like he thought I was stoned again. <br>
<br>
At about 3 Oclock I was ready for sleep, but I knew it would be a rough sleep until about 5 so I had a smoke went to my room and put on a movie. After 4 episodes of that 70's show I was asleep. Dead on the 9 hour mark that is easiest to aim for when taking this drug.<br>
<br>
Authors note: I often describe 2-ce and 2-ci as liquid mushrooms. They are much cheaper than mushrooms and don't give me the lasting effects of mild depression after taking it.   Some regular feelings that can lead to my discomfort in the trip are faster heart rate, shaking, nausea, vomiting, dilation of pupils, a small sense of 'only I feel like this'ù when in groups. Otherwise the good outweighs anything bad.<br>

PCP, a drug I would have been a little worried to try for the first time. So I guess its better that I didnt know I was smoking bud that had been dipped in shit at the time.<br>
<br>
The day started as usual when I'm at my cousin's house. He had bought 2 grams of bud the day before my arrival, thinking he had JUST bought 2 grams of chronic and nothing more. We woke up early and took a walk into the desert, after a good 15 minute walk we found a good spot to sit on some old tires and a busted TV set. I sat out a bottle of water on the TV, an empty coke can, and a lighter. My cousin went to work turning the can into a pipe while I cursed him for leaving his real pipe at his girlfriends and examined the 2 Gs he had bought. <br>
<br>
The bud smelled like shit, I figured my cousin had been been sold some mec, but he ashured me his dealer ALWAYS had good stuff. I didn't complain anymore, I was getting free weed and was in no place to complain. Finally we got to smoking the bud, originally we planned to just smoke a little, but after awhile we decide to smoke it all. The strange thing was, I didnt feel a damn thing the entire time I was smoking. I felt perfectly normal until we were finished smoking. By now I was convinced this bud was weaker than hell since normally it doesn't take but half a gram to at least get me buzzing. <br>
<br>
We tossed the can and took a drink of water. Disappointed I stood up, and promptly fell flat on my ass. I couldnt believe it, I felt as though someone had kicked me clean off my feet. My cousin laughed and also struggled to stand. I got back up and looked around. The desert became a strange blur, moutains faded into sand, I felt this most the closest thing to a mirage I will ever see. From there my eyes really changed. Everything in my vision became a circular blur, a tunnel, around everything but a tiny hole where my eyes were focused. Whatever was in the tiny opening seemed to be miles and miles away. About this time two things were happening. My body felt lighter than ever, my whole being felt like I was both steel and feather. The other thing was I was realizing, is that this couldnt have just been weed. Time seemed slower like I was on bud, but my body felt like a surge of energy, WAY more energy than any meth benge I had ever been on. The energy wasn't just spasmodic either (like meth), it was a constant flow, I was a battery! <br>
<br>
Usually I have very deep connections with my cousin when we are high, I really feel brotherhood with him. But not this time, I was alone, one of a kind. As we made our way back to his house, I felt almost godlike. Nothing was out of my grasp! Looking through the tunnel that covered my eyes I spotted a man walking towards us in the desert a few miles away. I had hardly spoken to my cousin until now. I suggested we beat this man into the dirt. My cousin looked in the direction of the man. He said, No, he has a kid with him. I looked again and to my surprise the man was walking right in front of me, with a child. Disappointed he wasn't punchingbag material and slightly surprised he had snuck up on me I kept walking.<br>
<br>
By now I couldn't even think, I remember gravity loosing hold of me all together. I raced my cousin the rest of the way home, he won, but I didn't care. You wouldn't have believed how fast I ran, lighting couldn't touch me. The rest of the day was a blur. I remember little, only staying in the house trying to figure out how I ever got so fucked. The next days I spent getting lots of sleep. The stuff left we very tired and much more week than just bud usually does. In fact my legs muscles hurt quite bad for the rest of the week.<br>
<br>
Later in the week my cousin stopped by his dealer's house. The first thing he said was 'So... how was it?' And then explained to my cousin that we had smoked 'dip shit' as he fondly called it. Looking back I am more than glad I tried it. I cant describe the feeling that shit gave me. I didn't try flipping cars or anything of the sort to test if I had herculean strength, but I didn't need to. I felt like I could tear a skyscraper down when I was on that shit, and thats all that matters...<!--   End Body   -->

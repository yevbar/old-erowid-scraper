I can describe it as 'The Holy Grail' of hallucinogens. Its effects were almost completely visual in nature. I felt almost sober the entire time I was on it. Anyone could have perceived me as sober, with the exception of very dilated eyes.<BR>
<BR>
I took it at about 8:00 PM on Saturday, just as the kegger I was at started to rage. I began drinking at about 5:00 PM, and by 8:00, I had consumed quite a bunch, and was very tipsy. I drank to work up the courage to do it, and I'm glad I did. The night before, I had almost completely talked myself out of it over concerns about warping my thoughts too much toward the negative, as most hallucinogens do to me now.<BR>
<BR>
I drank a little more over the next two hours, but very little, really. Over those two hours, I noticed no effects, however I did feel myself sober up (from the liquor) very quickly. At about 9:30 PM, I felt completely sober, and began to feel the drug coming on. It felt quite a bit like acid coming up. I felt electricity in my mouth. My palms were buzzing, and my torso felt almost imperceptibly twitchy or tense. Shortly after that, I began to see the slightest color patterns if I closed my eyes. I noticed that the decorative Christmas lights in the house were getting very bright.<BR>
<BR>
About an hour after I first noticed effects, I began to wonder if I had taken enough. I had been sitting outside talking to people, and really didn't notice any new effects. I could walk around fine, I didn't get dizzy, I was able to speak coherently, I didn't stare at anything or anyone.* (I warn everyone NOT to re-dose at all.)<BR>
<BR>
Shortly after I thought I may have under-dosed, I went into the bathroom to check on my eyes. The walls in the bathroom were wallpapered with ripped up paper bags. I looked at them for a bit, and realized that I had taken plenty. The patterns came out, and the walls gained depth. <BR>
<BR>
Over the next couple of hours, the visual effects became extremely intense. I've never actually had visual hallucinations like this. I've had effects that made a door seem to flex a bit, but the walls were actually 'breathing' this time. At times the walls looked like a drop-rippled pond. Carpet patterns were extremely complex and deep (they seemed to penetrate inches into the carpet). There was an semi-round bathroom carpet that seemed to spin like meshing gears. Textured walls and ceilings revealed obvious fractal patterns. I had all this while feeling almost sober enough to drive. Nobody could tell I was on anything. I retained all of my ego and intellect. I could hold meaningful conversations without struggling for vocabulary. On other hallucinogens, achieving this degree of visual warpage, I would have been completely hosed.<BR>
<BR>
Biting sarcasm and clever witticisms flowed like a river from my mouth. It seemed my comedy switch was stuck in the 'on' position.<BR>
<BR>
I went to the bathroom to see if my face was warping, but it didn't significantly, and nobody else's did either.<BR>
<BR>
*The only other significant sensory warping was my sense of beauty. (That's not quite right, but I don't know how else to describe it.) There were several pretty girls at this party, and I really had to stay conscious of how long I looked at any of them, to avoid staring. Several girls who I would normally find pretty, ended up looking extremely attractive. Others, of whom I wouldn't normally think much, looked the same.<BR>
<BR>
The effects lasted approximately 11 hours, from dosage to sleep. I lay tired and awake on a couch for two hours watching the colored etch-a-sketch on the inside of my eyelids before I could sleep. If I concentrated, I could control the images to a limited degree.<BR>
<BR>
Still, today, two days later, I feel energetic and happy. It was everything that I'd hoped for, and nothing I'd feared.<!--   End Body   -->

What follows is a dream I had last night, and is entirely fiction.<BR>
<BR>
100g dried T. Peruvianus, soxhleted 4 hours with 200mL MeOH, yielding dark green extract.  After solvent recovery, 100mL dH2O added to flask, and 3 tsp. ascorbic acid added 1 tsp. at a time, swirled around to dissolve alkaloids.  Fluid then strained through coffee filter into pyrex dish and set into 100 degree F oven to evaporate for several hours (ensuring all MeOH removed).  Brown residue then rehydrated with dH2O to a total volume of 350mL and placed in a bottle for storage.<BR>
<BR>
Arriving at my friend A.'s house, original plan was to each consume 50mL 3x separated by 45 minutes each time, to reduce nausea.  As A. did not have a measuring cup less than 100mL, extract was further diluted with 350mL of tapwater immediately before first dose, and 100mL parceled out into two glasses.  Tapwater was then added to fill the glasses.<BR>
<BR>
T+0 5:15pm, I found I was able to slowly sip the noxious tasting extract over a 30 minute period.  A. had trouble suppressing gag reflex from the taste and found it necessary to take larger less frequent sips chased by some pina colada mix.  As we were not much enjoying the taste and hoped to shorten the ordeal, we decided to take the doses at half hour intervals instead of 45 minutes.<BR>
<BR>
T+30m 5:45pm, 100mL parceled out again, this time without further dilution in order to reduce the volume of liquid to be consumed.  I found the easiest way to consume this was to swish the pina colada mix around in my mouth, swallow it, then immediately down the entire contents of my glass, followed by more pina colada mix to cover the aftertaste.  A. could not manage to suppress the gag reflex enough to do this in one go, so followed the same procedure in smaller increments over twenty minutes or so.<BR>
<BR>
T+45m 6:15pm, neither of us feeling much effect yet, maybe a Shulgin +/-, so the remaining extract was divided, this time mixed directly with a large amount of pina colada mix.  This made the taste far easier to handle although the unpleasant aftertaste remained.  A. did not take hers for perhaps another 20 minutes as she needed to allow time for nausea to subside (which she believed due to the taste and not the alkaloids).<BR>
<BR>
By about 7pm, we were both feeling about +1 and very MDMAish, this seemed to increase to a +2 over the next few hours.  Based on information we'd read, we expected to peak in about 4 hours, which would have been by around 10:15-10:30.  No greater effects were noted, however, and around 11, A. attempted to eat some chinese food. She felt a bit nauseous afterwards and a bit after midnight wanted to try going to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
T+11:45 5am, I'd been trying to read a bit in bed, when my lightbulb went out.  Oh well, I figured I'd try meditating a bit and maybe fall asleep.  No such luck, I very quickly discovered that my effects were coming back up, and moreover, to a full +3.  Twelve hours after ingestion and I was just now finally peaking!  Waves of nervous energy and darting forced me out of bed again, and I found myself walking my darkened apartment, navigating a largely pixelated space similar to video static which had just enough signal to make out what is where.  Compulsively, I walked, around, and around, while having some very interesting mental processes going on.<BR>
<BR>
T+13:00 6:15am, Okay, enough of this; I need some sleep tonight.  I take 2 grams of GHB, which is for me the usual 'sleeping' dose.  Sleep does not happen, instead I feel both the GHB and Mescaline working against one another, causing some buzzing sensation in my ears.  Eventually, they find a compromise, and I wound up lying down and having some very intense trance experiences.  Very pleasant.<BR>
<BR>
T+14:30 7:45am, I'm back up, walking, walking, walking.  Meantime my eyes feel heavy and the sedation of the GHB is quite evident, but is insufficient to overcome the nervous energy of the Mescaline.  I begin jotting some notes to myself about the last few hours, my ability to type coherently is very affected, although I feel relatively mentally clear otherwise.  I decide to take another gram of GHB and attempt sleep again.<BR>
<BR>
This time I played an interesting trick on myself.  While I was visualizing the sedative effect coming up and overpowering the Mescaline, as if to prepare her (for by now she was Madame M. to me) for what was about to hit her, I apparently slipped asleep, and then rewoke still expecting the sedative attack.  I observed it was now 9:38am, however, so it seems I must have slept some.<BR>
<BR>
T+16:30 9:45am, Up, walking, dancing like a meat puppet on a string, because I feel no particular need to restrain myself from doing so and M. seemed to want me to move in this particular way.  So I just went with the flow, and decided that more sleep was simply not going to happen.  Mydriasis still evident, even now.<BR>
<BR>
T+16:45 10am, I call A. and compare notes, she'd gotten about two hours of sleep as well and woken suddenly at 5am due to an unrelated household disturbance, and found herself unable to sleep afterwards.  She reported having had several very strange and disturbing dreams, some of which related back to a previous experience she'd had with 4-Acetoxy-DET a week ago.  As we talked for the next hour or so my nervous energy gradually subsided and I found I could stop walking and relax.<BR>
<BR>
Both of us agreed we'd try this experience again sometime, but only if we dosed first thing in the morning, and with the extract capsuled to avoid the horrible taste.<!--   End Body   -->

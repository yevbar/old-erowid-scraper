The night began at the mall. I was doing some last minute christmas shopping when I saw my friend A and his girlfriend T. I ask them if they wanted to hang out and watch the football game. I had a few doses of 2C-I, so I asked them if they wanted to possibly trip. They said maybe, and I told them I would call in a few hours. <BR>
<BR>
I came over to A's house at about 9:30 and we watched the game. We invited S over. I had 2 beers and started smoking some good weed. After 2 bowls, I had to lay my head on the table, because of my blinding head rush. I get those when I combine alcohol and pot, I think it is because of low blood pressure. We start thinking of what to do. S has a brother M, and I decide to drive us all there. I am pretty experienced driving high, and my alcohol buzz was almost gone.<BR>
<BR>
I then mention to everyone the trip I had brought along. S sounded very interested after I told him a little bit about it. A and T were slightly hesitant.<BR>
<BR>
We get to his brothers house and just chill for a while and smoke. It was getting late, and I wanted A and T to make up their minds whether to trip or not. They finally did. It was 1:50am when we all dosed, except for M, the owner of the house. A and T decided to take my preweighed 10mg capsules. S decided to take 15mg. I took 20mg on a mostly empty stomach. I knew we took it a little too late, but I had valiums in case anyone wanted their trip stopped in the morning.<BR>
<BR>
We smoked a few more bowls of M's good weed. I gave M 5mg of valium for letting us chill and trip there. I took the other half to reduce nausea. I believe it sugnificantly reduced the nausea. <BR>
<BR>
I think about 30 mins later, I started to feel it. It was stimulating, in a good way, on top of the strong, but subsiding cannabis buzz. It felt especially tingly in my hands and feet.<BR>
<BR>
In an hour it was definite. I was starting to 'hear' that buzzing I do with most other psychedelics, like nitrous and sometimes LSD. The others were feeling it too. They said their stomach hurt. A said he was feeling more awake. S commented 'This stuffs weird' in a happy voice. A said he felt more awake. I asked T if she felt it and she said 'yea.. a little.'<BR>
<BR>
We all sat down to watch a circus show, which was odd. M had put it on for us. I was starting to see visuals at 3:30. They were smooth, objects had a very slight rippling effect to them. Peoples' faces did the same thing. Tracers were present. When someone talked and moved their head it would look blurry. Colors were much brighter. <BR>
<BR>
At about 4, I remember us all laughing and having a good time, talking about random things, some very funny and stupid. A and T were giggling and laughing. S looked more sedated, layed back. My visuals started increasing in intensity. The body feeling was great. It was an extremely pleasurable rush, most likely serotonin, that kept pulsing in my brain and streaming out to my body. The visuals were very intense, acid like only finer.  <BR>
<BR>
We were at the peak at probably 4:10am. I think we were being pretty quiet in M's living room. I felt like I was in a meditative, beautiful trance. I remember T walking by me to go to the bathroom, the sound of her jogging pants created a whole new wave of pleasure. I believe my conscious started slipping away. I was staring at the wall, seeing swirls of color, some strobing, some flowing. Beautiful is an understatement.<BR>
<BR>
Then, the voice of what felt like something spriritual, talked to me. I dont really remember what was said, but it amazed me. I didn't really understand the message clearly. I think it was something like: 'find the beam of energy inside you', cause that is exactly what i felt. A beam of energy flowing through the middle of me. It felt so good. It was enlightenment, unfortunately, only temporary. I have no religious beliefs at this time, but I felt like I possibly could have been contacted by some higher power, as new parts of my brain were turned on and tuned in.<BR>
<BR>
Time was flying. It was 4:30 and I decided to take 20mg of diazepam (Valium), so I could drive soon. I rather drive on a calmer 2C-I trip than the peak of it. <BR>
<BR>
Steve was really messed up, laying on the couch in a dase. A and T were talking quietly and personal on the other couch. They were laughing and having fun, after a little pause of socialization. At 4:45, I popped 30mg more diazepam. I didn't want to be up all night.<BR>
<BR>
We left at 5am. We got in the car. I was still tripping hard, seeing intense tracers and visuals. The valium I started to kick in and actually seemed to intensify the visuals and the mindfuck. I kept seeing carlights shadows from them appear everywhere, like turning cars, but it was not real. <BR>
<BR>
They convinced me to let S drive, after we sat there for a while letting the car heat up. It was 25 degrees F out. We were shivering. S said he was fine to drive if I wanted to chill. It was obvious to them I was tripping harder than anyone else by the way I talked and acted. <BR>
<BR>
I told S he could drive. I have rode with him before when we were really high, and A and T trusted him and recommended that he should drive my car. He drove the 10 miles back very well. I sat in the front in bliss, the pleasure from being in a moving vehicle was great. I kept getting slightly paranoid about cops, because I kept seeing colors around me and it looked like police flashers at times.<BR>
<BR>
We got to A's parking lot at 5:45. I ask them how they feel. A and T both reply they feel awake, and S said he feels almost sober. <BR>
<BR>
I kept thinking i cant go home like this, but it was late, and I really wanted some time alone. S, T, and A were all cool, but I wanted quiet by myself. I had to turn the smoke ride they offered down. They offered to follow me home, which was about 2 miles. I said I would be fine, but being good friends, they followed me. I made it home and layed in bed. I could feel the valiums, but they weren't sedating like usual. They seemed to have almost no effect on the level of my trip, but I'm not sure. <BR>
<BR>
It was 6am, and I was still tripping whith visuals. The valiums caused some memory loss, so I am not sure when I fell asleep. I think it was around 7am. I awoke at around 2pm, feeling tired and weak. I felt slightly depressed also. That lasted just that day.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, this was a great trip. Suprisingly, I had very little nausea, unlike the others. I believe it was because the diazepam and cannabis. It has been 3 days, and I think I feel back to normal now. On the trip, I got along great with everyone. This was probably the most pleasurable trip I ever had, including times with MDMA. My thoughts were mainly positive, which doesn't always happen when on shrooms or acid. The visuals were very intense, unlike what many report. The trip was great, and will forever be apart of my memory for the most part.<!--   End Body   -->

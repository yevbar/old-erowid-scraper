I recently was sent a quarter ounce of Salvia to try from someone I met on the internet.  I have been reading about Salvia for quite sometime and I was very eager to try it.  I called a couple of my buddies and told them that I had recieved the Salvia.  I met up with 2 of them and we walked to another friends house.  It was about 12:30 a.m..  When we got to his house, we immediately went into his garage, because we were very eager to smoke the Salvia.  I packed a bowl of some Salvia 5X enhanced leaf and instantly put a butane lighter to it.  I was staring in the same spot the entire time I was enhaling the smoke. <BR>
<BR>
Before I even knew what was going on it hit me.  My head began falling back in one direction.  The image I was staring at, remained in the middle of my perspective although I was facing a completely different direction now.  I had (and have every time I smoke Salvia) such a great feeling of DEJA-VU.  I felt as if I knew the meaning to life, and that something terrible had happened.  I was at this point mumbling all sorts of nonsense, and my friends were telling me to be quiet.  I began seeing bright glowing white rips in time and space, and images of what I refered to as electronic hell engulfed my field of vision.  My friends were telling me to pack them a bowl, and I kept telling them that if I did such a thing that the cats would come running and stop existence.  I then yelled at my friend Lucas to 'Stay on grandma's porch.'  and that if he left 'it will cause the end of the world.'  I for some odd reason believed I was outside at daytime on my imaginary grandmothers back porch in the year 1976.  When in reality I was in a garage past midnight sitting on some folding chair smoking salvia.  I saw a whole other existence that time.<!--   End Body   -->

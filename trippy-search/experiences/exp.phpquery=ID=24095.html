Me and my friend B were at his house and his mom was at work as usual.  She had tons of Rx med bottles in her dresser and since I had the more knowledgable brain on what it is that can and can not 'fuck you up', I searched through it with his consent.  There wasn't much of anything useful.  I almost gave up among the thirty or so Rx labels until I noticed a famililar name; Klonopin.  Immediately, I grabbed the bottle, ran to the computer and searched it.  Most results showed phrases containing the word xanax so I immediately assumed it was a generic version of xanax.  (I now know that I was wrong and that though it is similar to Alprazolam, it is not the same drug.)  <BR>
<BR>
The pills expired in '96 (this took place in May of 2003)  The pills were 1mg each, blue and dusty from old age.  I decided to take one at first, then after a few minutes, I believe I took 1 or 2 more.  After B had consumed some, we decided we'd venture off with my car to the cemetery.  This is where my memory, before and after all this gets fuzzy to completely GONE.  The effects seemed sililar to hydrocodone, but remarkabley different and less apparent.  I danced around the mausoleum with my accoustic before deciding to take more...about 3 or 4 more.  My reasoning was this:  Maybe the years of sitting in that drawer had caused the chemical to begin breaking down.  <BR>
<BR>
Though I don't think this reasoning would have taken place had I not already consumed 3-4mg of it already.  We must have decided to get alcohol because the police report states there was alcohol found in the trunk of my car.  Police report?  Yea, I'll get to that.  I have this images in my mind of being in B's brother's room and finding alcohol in his small refrigerator.  The order of the events you are about to read are unknown, and neither is the validity.  <BR>
<BR>
My brother, R, was also in the car and had consumed a small amount of the clonasepam as well.  He was in the backseat.  There is a small park near B's house that we must have driven to at some point after the cemetery.  We allegedly drank there.  With a BAC of .058 and being 145, I must have consumed about a beer and a half to two beers.  I then was told by my brother that I was driving on the bike path at a supposedly high speed.  It was then, that I hit a tree...hard.  (my car no longer starts..possibly totaled)  My brother got out of the car...unknown to me (again, i can recall very little of this).  I drove off about 20 seconds after hitting the tree and just as the police reached the seen.  Apparently, my driving on the bike path was previously and immediately reported.  <BR>
<BR>
I then drove off down the road, and must have taken a left onto PG road where my car was found in the middle of an intersection...both me and B, in the front seat, blood everywhere, passed out.  I remember saying to a police officer after being asked about the blood 'I have chapped lips'  We were then taken to the hospital...can't remember...I was released into police custody and taken to the station..can't remember.  All I remember is seeing the pills near the cop and hoping he'd leave just for a moment and wanting to steal them.  Apparently I said something offensive cause I remember the cop getting nasty with me and saying, Hey, you're lucky I'm releasing you on this 20,000 dollar I bond.  I then went home.  <BR>
<BR>
The next day...<BR>
<BR>
I do not remember this day except for a few images that I can recall...but as told by a friend:<BR>
<BR>
I walked to meet B at 7-11.  On the way, an old friend, Jack saw me.  He said, Hey J.  I stumbled to the car and allegedly said 'who the hell are you?'  Now, I know his face from a good 50 feet away so this is odd for me to hear, especially since I remember NONE of this.  He dropped me off and I assume I met B there.  From there we must have walked a ways to the police station where he said he needed to meet an officer.  We got there somehow and they said, which THIS I DO recall, you have to go to the rolling meadows police station.  I knew where that was and I remember my frame of mind.  We must have walked another long walk because somehow we ended up at Wendy's.  B had stolen his mom's cell phone (which he does not remember, along with this stange string of events) I was told, just today, that I talked to two of my friends, S and M on that phone in wendy's.  S described my tone (the day after taking the drugs, and the accident with no further dosing) as it being 'not me at all'.  I supposedly went on to say that the accident was all her fault and if she would have picked us up that fateful day, it would have never happened.  Thing is, she wasn't supposed to pick us up from anywhere that day and we hadn't even talked to her.  Where I got that from, I dunno.  <BR>
<BR>
B was later picked up from wendy's by his mom.  I remember her walking in and B leaving.  I was told by B from his mom that I walked the opposite way.  The walk from wendy's to my house is a loooooooong one.  Easily over 5 miles on busy roads.  The only way I could have made it home, was to walk.  I do not recall walking....at all.  That entire day is no more than the images of the police station and B's mom walking into wendy's for that brief second.  <BR>
<BR>
All memory immediately fades away before and after those images.  I now face an underage DUI, and two other tickets.  I'm pretty fucked...and scared as to what happened that day and the following day...<!--   End Body   -->

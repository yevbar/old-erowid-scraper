<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: While it may be that the substances described below are ketamine and MDMA, Ecstasy tablets are notoriously impure or misrepresented, often containing chemicals other than those they are presumed to contain. This report is marked as an ketamine and MDMA report, but readers should be aware that this is more of a general Ecstasy report.] </FONT><br>
<br>
This happened a few months ago, but I'll try my best to remember it as complete as I can. I had gotten a job at a take-out pizza place at the beginning of summer. It was a very relaxed place to work; not too many orders, not too many rules, and a kitchen staff that loved to get high. I worked nights so there was always time on slow nights to indulge in higher consciousness. Working nights usually meant that blow was the drug of choice, but I live in a small community, so I pounce on any interesting drug that comes my way. <br>
<br>
It was a Friday night and I had an unusual shift for that day starting at 4:00pm. My friend (Let's call him M) and co-worker came into work later that night, and we ended up splitting a half gram of blow. At about 8 or 9 that night, he told me that his dealer had just come into possession of some Ecstasy tabs that had ketamine in them. I immediately grabbed my wallet and handed over some bills in excitement. He got a ride with a delivery driver and returned with 3 yellow pills with an Oakley symbol imprinted on them. We both swallowed 1 tablet at about 11:30 pm on semi-empty stomachs. Once I finished my shift at 12:00am, I could feel a slight buzz, but nothing very noticeable. For the next hour I hung around the back area, waiting for it to kick in. It was now about T+1:15 since I dropped my first hit, and nothing was happening yet, just the same light buzz. So I decided to drop my other tab. <br>
<br>
T+2:15 - We decided to go out back and smoke a bowl with the other night worker. It was at this point that I first started to feel the high creeping up on me. My eyes start to wiggle very lightly. We walked back into the kitchen and BOOM! It hit me out of nowhere, as ecstasy usually does to me. Everything appeared to have a metallic glow to it, and I couldn't help but comment on how cool everything looked; like everything had been cleaned up and polished. A smile grew on my face that probably stayed there for the entire duration of my trip. I noticed that these pills didn't have the usual openness and talkative qualities that pure MDMA has. <br>
<br>
For the next hour or so, I kept myself busy running around the front area and kitchen, just enjoying all the eye wiggling and enhanced scenery. Mr friend M's pill still hadn't kicked in yet, so he suggested we split one more pill to snort. We got a ride and he picked up one more tab. <br>
<br>
T+3:15 - We proceded to crush up the pill and each snort half of it. There weren't many orders that night, so we closed early.<br>
<br>
T+3:45 - We left work and smoked another bowl behind the building before we started to walk to M's house. Things started to get really intense at this point. On the way to his house (which was only about 3 blocks away), my eye wiggling was incredibly abundant. Everything I focused on would start to shake violently back and forth, including large buildings. I also noticed that if I concentrated, I could make the eye wiggling stop for a few seconds, and then start it back up. I didn't feel much like talking about anything in particular except for how fucked up I was.<br>
<br>
T+4:15 - We finally arrived at M's house. This is when things really started to get weird. We had to be quiet so as not to wake up his roommates. He killed the lights and we decided to watch 'Ren and Stimpy'. I couldn't concentrate on it at all. I was sweating profusely and very disoriented. We threw on the movie 'Clerks' after an unsuccessful try at watching 'Ren and Stimpy'<br>
<br>
T+4:30 - M looked over at me kind of funny for a second, before saying: 'My pill just kicked in.' It was at this point as well that I could feel my second hit kicking in. M immediately sunk into his couch looking very relaxed and agreed that it was a very strong batch. Within 15 mins of his pill kicking in, he passed out from a combination of intense relaxtion and a hard night's work. So I was left by myself with a head full of Special K and nothing to do.<br>
<br>
My vision started to go slightly blurry and I couldn't concentrate on the movie at all. Anyone who's a fan of Kevin Smith knows that his movies are all about dialogue, but at the moment I couldn't even understand what anybody was saying on the TV. It sounded echoed and far off. Then the visuals really kicked in. All the heads of the characters in the movie started to twist and flail all over the place, like the Tazmanian Devil in Bugs Bunny cartoons. The weird thing was that it was only the heads that were moving. This was just a little too weird for me, so I turned off the movie and turned on M's GameCube. I put the game Mario Golf in and turned it on. <br>
<br>
Things got really hazy right about now. I remember that simple actions such as choosing a character had become next to impossible. I just could't compute the command in my head. I eventually started the game and from that point on, I can't remember anything for 2 hours. Except I could remember some 'clips' from the experience. I remember looking at a clock, looking back at the TV screen for what felt like 1 minute, and looking back at the clock to see that an hour had passed already. I also remember at one point staring at the game on the screen, but I was unable to actually play it, as if my body was paralyzed. This wasn't alarming to me at all, just extremely confusing. It was like I was too confused to think about anything else or feel any other distinct emotion. When this happened, it felt like I was watching the screen from a different 'stlye' of view. The only way I can describe it is 'bubble-vision.' It was like an exagerated fish-eye camera lens was placed over my vision like in CKY and Jackass movies.<br>
<br>
T+6:45 - I quite literally 'found' myself turning off the machine as I popped back into the real world. I turned off the TV and went to sleep, as if nothing had happened.<br>
<br>
The next day M told me that he had woke up during the night and got a drink. I can't remember any of this at all, but he said that when he woke up, the TV and game was on, but the character wasn't moving. He got up and looked over at me, and I was clutching the controller, not moving. I turned my head towards him, shot him a big grin, and turned back to the game without saying anything.<br>
<br>
That was the first time I had ever done ketamine, and it was the the most intense trip I've ever had on ecstasy. I bought a few more tabs a couple of days after and ended up consuming 3 more hits on 2 separate occasions that week. I never got the same ketamine high, or even a very good MDMA high the other 2 times. But I dropped a single hit of another kind of ecstasy (yellow bells) a couple of days after my last attempt at the yellow Oakleys. I got pretty high off those, so I think I had just built a tolerance to the active chemicals in the Oakleys. All in all, it was really fun, but I was just lucky I was sitting down and in a safe environment when the ketamine kicked in hard.<!--   End Body   -->

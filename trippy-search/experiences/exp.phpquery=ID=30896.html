<!--   Start Body   -->


Let me start out by saying what my background with drugs was. Until I got into a car accident in July of 02, I had never done the prescription pill thing. Back in February of 96, I had my Gall Bladder out, and I was given Tylenol 3 Codeine pills for the pain from the sutures afterward. Those made me fall asleep pretty much within a half hour of taking them, and I only took them for about 4 days. I had only used the following drugs before: alcohol, nicotine, marijuana, and some LSD ( a lot of doses I got were very weak).<BR>
<BR>
So here I am, the day after I got into my car accident, with very bad neck and back pain, which turns out to be permanent injuries, so I look forward to being pain all the time. I was given a bottle of 30 hydrocodone 7.5/500mgs to begin with. I knew I wanted to have the pain be gone, but I was honestly a bit scared of prescription pain pills. My boyfriend, however, who will do any drug given to him, was very excited that I was to start receiving pills all the time. I was also given a bottle of 30 Skelaxin (muscle relaxers). I took one Lortab, within 15 minutes, it made me start feeling warm and sleepy. I fell asleep for about 30 mins, and woke up, feeling very nauseated and sweaty. Since then I have read that I can take these pills with food, but having food in the stomach may decrease the effects of this medication. I tried taking a Skelaxin then, and even the next few times I took those, they made me sleepy, and not very buzzed at all. It went on with me taking those Lortabs for a week until my follow up doctors appt. She then gave me another script, this time for ones slightly weaker (5/500), and no more Skelaxins, which I didn't care because I had given those to my sister anyway. I started to like the way the buzz felt from the Lortabs, since I cannot remember a time in the last 10 years where I felt numb and happy, since I suffer from very severe clinical depression.<BR>
<BR>
My next doctors appt was where I ran into the Ultrams. The doctor, who is office is very infamous for not giving adequate pain relief, suggested that instead of Lortabs, she let me try something new for pain relief. She gave me a script of 30 Tramadol HCL (Ultram) 50 Mgs.  I knew that my sister, who is a very big pill popper takes these pills all the time, and was always running out, so these pills equated to dollar signs in my eyes, since I was already planning on calling the doctor the next day and telling her that these don't work, so I could get more Lortabs. I did try the Tramadols tho, I was prescribed one ever 4-6 hours as needed. It didn't do a darn thing for me, buzz or pain releif wise, and me being a low tolerance/lightweight, I was very surprised that my sister the pill head, liked these so much. I voiced my concerns, and she told me that I had to take at least 2 or 3 at once to get a nice buzz.<BR>
<BR>
I decided, what the hey, I was planning on going to Bingo with my Mom that night anyway, and figured I could use a good buzz, since I have this huge problem with large groups of people staring at me. So I pop 2 Ultrams, and I sick on a Type O negative CD, and wait for these to kick in. After 20 mins, I a still feeling nothing, so I decide to go and get what me and my sister now call 'The Bible', which is 'The Complete Prescription Pill Guide for 2002'. It says in this book that peak effect usually takes about a half an hour.<BR>
<BR>
I wait patiently, and I start to feel a little relaxed, and slightly happy. As the minutes tick by, I start to feel more and more buzzed, and for some reason, really lovey -dovey. All through the night, at Bingo, I was very happy, telling my Mom that I was going to marry my bf someday, and people were just looking at me very weird, because I am more of the dry/cynical type. I take 2 more pills at Bingo, and by the time I got home, I was more buzzed than I had ever been. I was on the computer, and I could have swore that I saw the mouse move by itself, and still I felt extremely lovey dovey, and figured that this is what Ecstasy must feel like, only without all the bad side effects I hear about E.<BR>
<BR>
I finally fall asleep, and it's weird, even now, a year and half, and thousands of pills later, when I fall asleep on Ultrams, I alternate waking up at the drop of a hat, or any little noise, but it doesn't bother me in the slightest. Also, I can fall asleep at the drop of a hat as well, or start zoning out of nowhere, which leads to falling asleep.<BR>
<BR>
 In the course of the next year, I almost felt empowered that I was using these Ultrams, not even worrying about getting more Lortabs, because the Ultram buzz was so much stronger, and lasted so much longer. My boyfriend started taking these pills too, and for the entire summer of the car accident, we would pretty much lay in bed, pop pill, kiss each other and have sex (which these pills inhibit ejaculation very badly, it can take up to 2 hours to come, and sometimes he just got sick of trying and give up, yet he extremely horny), and discuss getting married. This was very weird and uncharacteristic for us both, since he was never the mushy type, and he always had a lower sex drive, like once a week or two was good enough for him.<BR>
<BR>
I then decided that Ultram was a miracle drug. I read that it is also used as an anti-depressant sometimes, which would figure as to why for the first time since I was 12, I wasn't depressed at all anymore. I vowed I would die from them before I would give them up. Lets talk about dosage a bit here, at first I was taking and only needing about 3 or 4 pills to get a massive buzz, but gradually, my tolerance was increasing, and I needed to take 3 at a time, then 2 about an hour later to get the same kind of buzz. Sometimes, I would take about 8 a day total, which I read was the suggested maximum daily dosage, so I figured I was okay. I always had a steady supply of these pills, sometimes having to lie to my doctor and pharmacy when me and my guy would take so many that I would need to refill in 2 weeks, instead of the months supply I was given. <BR>
<BR>
Then, the first time I was out, and could not refill for 2 weeks, I found out how addictive these pills were. I never thought I was physically addicted, I thought I just wanted them because I liked them, I was never an addict at all to anything, I was never a big drinker, maybe drinking once every 2 months. I also took narcotic pain pills, which Ultrams are a synthetic opiod , so they are not, and I never got addicted to those. But when I ran out, I was okay for the first day, a lil depressed , but normal. The second day, I got the worst withdrawals. Sweating, nausea, fever, body aches, and worst of all, feeling so un-energetic that it felt like a truck hit me. Bad Dreams, like the guy in Trainspotting has, and very, very bad insomnia. I can say that I constantly felt like I had a horrid flu.<BR>
<BR>
My respite came in 10 days, when my sister just got a full bottle and just as I was starting to feel better, and be done with withdrawals, and possibly the habit, gave me 2 Ultrams. Whoa! I was up to needing at least 10 a day to keep me buzzed, and not taking em for 10 days, dropped my tolerance back down to nothing. I was buzzed all night long from those 2, and found a way to refill 4 days early the next day, so I was back to my old habits again.<BR>
<BR>
So, about a year after the accident, I still got buzzed from the Ultrams,sometimes, cutting down so I can drop my tolerance a bit, when my sister tells me that Lortab/Ultram cocktails are very nice buzzes. I had since switched doctors, to one recommended by a friend of my sister, who was known to treat pain adequately, which I did still need these pills for my back pains. he was writing me Lortabs scripts, but since I needed at least 4 of those to get a buzz,and he upped my dosage to 10/500 mgs, I was just selling them to friends instead of taking them.<BR>
<BR>
Let me describe the differences between an Ultram and a Lortab Buzz, and an Ultram/Lortab cocktail buzz. An Ultram buzz is a lot stronger, and I feel very happy and floaty, and more personable, however, I get extremely irritable at times, and tend to snap at ppl for 'bothering' me in my zone. Also, these pills do make me get very constipated at times, once, I had not had a bowel movement in 2 weeks, but didn't even think of it, until I it tried to pass, which I then had to go to the hospital, and they gave me and enema, and I had anal fissures from passing such a large movement. The doctor told me I was lucky that I didn't rupture my large intestine, since there was a small weak spot on it, which could have killed me. <BR>
<BR>
Also, Ultrams can give me the mother of all headaches the next morning, as it's like having a bad hangover. The kind of headaches that hurt so bad, I think I am going to have a stroke, and I throw up if I move around too much. Also, I have given some pills to friends over the time, in addition to my bf, and they have all thrown up from taking too many at first, and I never have (knock on wood). But to me, these side effects are worth the buzz, and me not being depressed and miserable with life all the time. Also, I forgot to mention, a few other side effects I have experienced were very dry mouth, a hard time urinating, and dizziness and sweating, plus itching.<BR>
<BR>
As far as the Lortab buzz goes, it is more of a low key, mellow, chilling buzz. I would imagine that heroin feels this way, times a hundred.  I got a lot of the same side effects as Ultrams.<BR>
<BR>
As far as the cocktails go, I have taken varied amounts, the most recent I can remember is 4 Ultrmas, plus 2 Lortabs (10/500). I get a very hard buzz, very mellow, puts me to sleep quite often, but I have the extreme happiness that I get from the Ultrams too. The amount of headaches I have gotten from these cocktails seem to be a lot more than from both drugs alone. These headaches are really no fun.<BR>
<BR>
In summary, it has been a year and  half since I started up with these pills. The Ultrams are highly addictive.<!--   End Body   -->

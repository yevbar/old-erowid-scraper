I had recently acquired a supply of 100mg 5-meo-mipt, and was working my way through it. Having become more comfortable with sharing it with others at about my last 50 mgs, I decided to share an experience with my partner, X. She agreed to try it with me, and so the plan was set!<br>
<br>
The experience was to be set at an outdoor music festival, camping over the weekend. At first our hope was dwindling as the first day and morning were very rainy, but as the day progressed and a beautifully full rainbow appeared in the sky, we realized it was going to be clear for the rest of the afternoon. And at that we headed back to our tent to retrieve the 5-meo-mipt.<br>
<br>
The way that the fine powder had been divided up among gel capsules had been in a sort of 'halving method', which was explained elsewhere - the basis of that you start with a weighed material and keep halving it down to a smaller material, so roughly each pill had 5mg, give or take 3 or so mg. Fairly large error margin, but the expressed safety I had gathered led me to believe that it would be fine.<br>
<br>
So, there we sat, both with 2 gel capsules in hand. Mine being a good bit larger than hers, X expressed that she would like to give me one of hers for one of mine to even out the amount a bit, as mine were visibly much larger. I agreed to this and as fortune would have it, this turned out to be a very, very good move on my part. In retrospect, these were some of the last capsules I had left, all my other smaller comparisons had been used up, so I didn't realize how disproportionate the dose was this time as to earlier tests, it must have been at least 20 mg judging by the sheer intensity of the experience.<br>
<br>
Now, it took about 20 minutes to start kicking, and boy did it kick. 5-MeO-Mipt feels unique to me in that it's almost completely void of visual distortions until I venture into higher territory, and up there, it's an all business sort of trip. I will become meshed into the ground I am standing on, pleasurable chills run through out my body, and all the world seems to work in a large clock work motion, a circle of life. We both expressed what was changing around us as we walked over a bridge onto an island in the middle of a lake, looking out among the crowds, we could close our eyes and be lost in infinity.<br>
<br>
We thought that this was the peak, mind you this is about the 2 hour mark, and all I can say is that we were terribly wrong. We walked back to our tent to get water and lay down together, and as we did that, we both fell deeply into trance like states of thought, pulling each other closely time felt as if it meshed together, whispered words unbeknown to the speaker were uttered and as I opened my eyes, I realized what is going on outside of my mind. I decide I need to get out of the tent to go tend to biological needs, and as I said that, we both felt like it was the end of the world. What was out beyond that tent? We don't know. How would we know? Will you come back? <br>
<br>
I unzipped the tent and stepped out into chilly evening and store up at the sky, beautiful, endless. I must be quick. I tend to what I'm doing and as I walk across the sort of meadow, I see many people, all so picturesque, beautiful, life in motion, how can we not usually appreciate this? This is wonderful, I must share this with her!<br>
<br>
I run quickly back to the tent and tell X to come out and look at the sky. It's wonderful, beautiful. And then I become too comfortable with the moment and I realize how easy it is in our normal life to become sucked into what we are doing. Time meshes. No, stop, I don't want to be this comfortable, I want to feel the sense of being free. I want to step out of my bounds, I want to see the beautiful sky for every moment it has to offer me until the sun sets.<br>
<br>
I tell X that we must move, that I don't want to get caught in this moment again, that we must keep going on. I need to see new things, life has so much to offer and as I move through it if I stick on the same thing I will miss out on alot of what I could be seeing. This always sounded bad to me. This has nothing to do with X, though, I wanted this moving for her, as well. She realizes my anxiety to the situation and complies, I want to show her the world, Break into something beautiful. <br>
<br>
We walk through the meadow, admiring the sky, the night is beautiful, and we gently start to come down, though it doesn't come near to letting off until I finally get to sleep. I felt refreshed the next day, and had no urge to repeat this experience soon, walking away with a sense of true happiness.<!--   End Body   -->

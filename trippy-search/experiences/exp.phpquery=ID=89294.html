AM2201 is a HIGHLY potent synthetic cannabinoid to be used with caution. To provide some background on my use of substances, I have dabbled in a little of everything: tons and tons of weed, coke, molly, shitty beans from the ghetto, LSD, ketamine, shrooms, salvia, nitrous, DMT, and the list goes on. In the past few months, as I was arrested for a DUI and possession charge back in July, I have consumed an upwards of 10 grams of JWH-018. I have also smoked the -073, -122, -081, -200, -210, -250 variants.<br>
<br>
I had very recently acquired AM2201 from an online vendor. Knowing that it was supposed to be roughly 3x the potency of JWH-018 with much higher binding affinities to both CB1 and CB2 receptors, I dosed my first hit roughly 15mg. I do not own a mg scale (stupid I know), but my extensive research with the JWH compounds lead me to believe this would be like getting high the first few times I smoked JWH. <br>
<br>
:00 - I inhaled the vapor and immediately begin to feel vibrations in my body. <br>
<br>
:25 - extreme lethargy overcomes me, I feel as though I weigh 800 lbs.<br>
<br>
1 min - so extremely tired, an uneasing feeling is building in the back of my head<br>
<br>
2 mins - heart begins racing, sweat forms on palms, mild anxiety attack<br>
<br>
5mins - trying to calm myself down as I realize that I have consumed too much of the substance<br>
<br>
20 mins - fall asleep<br>
<br>
I then slept for about 3 hours. The body load I got from AM2001 was unreal. It felt almost like I couldn’t even move. Later that evening my friends from my hometown wanted to try it. Being only a few minutes away, I agreed to come in and share some of this research chemical -- warning them that it was far more potent than the JWH compounds. <br>
<br>
Once I arrived at B's house, 5 other people were to try the substance as well. I loaded everyone a hit roughly 10-12mg. Using the same pipe, B hit it first, followed by J, D, P, and then C. Immediately I noticed J making extremely strange facial movements and noises. A minute after they took the hit, 3 of my friends, J, D, and P all dropped to the floor. They were fucking blacked out cold. J was screaming and acting psychotically, screaming at the top of his lungs, 'I DIEDDDD, WHAT IN THE FUCKKKK, I LOVE YOU GUYYSSSSS'. He was thrashing about uncontrollably, slamming his head into the wall several times. D was out cold, hitting his head on the floor his breathing depressed and heart rate increased. P fell onto the couch and started shaking so violently it appeared to be a seizure. A few seconds later vomit erupted from his mouth and I had to slam him on to his stomach on the floor. <br>
<br>
All 3 of them began vomiting and had trouble breathing. B and C were both high but were helping me attempt to calm them down. All 3 of the researchers had extreme looks of physical pain once they came out of the immediate stupor of vomiting and clenching every muscle in their body. The next 30 minutes or so was spent holding their heads up so that they would breathe and not choke on their vomit. J wouldn't be quiet and continued screaming and thrashing about.  I ended up calling my best friend for backup, as this entire experience was a train wreck horrible and terrifying experience. He said he could hear screaming from way out in the parking lot of the complex.  In all, they were completely out of it for about an hour and experienced after confusion for another hour or so. What worried me the most was how they completely lost consciousness within a minute of the dose.  Hours later I let my friend G try 5mg of it, thinking since he was so large (6', 280lbs) and relatively experienced with JWH compounds, that he would be alright. <br>
<br>
He looked pale and sick within seconds after taking the hit. He began saying confused and jumbled words and within 5 minutes, he too blacked out. I caught him with all my might and called another person over to help. I laid him on the floor, and after a minute or two of lying down, he jumps up and resumes his position against the sink. He never vomited but noted he had a horrible experience and scared everyone with how fucked up he was. <br>
<br>
I believe these reactions were almost mini seizures, caused by AM2201's ability to bind to the CB1 and CB2 with ridiculous binding affinities;  with a Ki of 1.0nM at CB1 and 2.6nM at CB2. This potent cannabinoid was dosed entirely too high for my amateur research friends. The GABA synapses were probably slowed to the point of unconsciousness and seizing. Just be warned, this chemical is only for those with high tolerances to the naph substances. It is very likely if one was to react like my friends did to this chemical alone, they hold the possibility of severe injury to themselves or others. Research safely my friends. If anyone else dabbles in research with is chem, DOSE LOW. I mean like 1mg, maybe even 500ug!<!--   End Body   -->

<!--   Start Body   -->



Day 1:<BR>
 I ground 5grms of Peganum Harmala seeds, 10 Baby Hawaiian Woodrose seeds, & approx. 25cm of Cielo Banisteriopsis Caapi vine bark into powder. I then added 5000mlgrms of viatamin C & boiled in a non-aluminun pot(aluminun does not react well with ayahuasca)for approx. 7 hrs. The liquid was first strained through a fine metal screen, & then through a coffee filter. I set the liquid aside, & re-boiled the leftovers for an additional 2 hrs. The same straining proceedure was followed, & the liquids were combined. I then boiled the combined liquids until it reached a volume of approx. 1/2cup. This was then refrigerated.<BR>
<BR>
Day 2:<BR>
 I ground 17grms of Mimosa Hostilis root bark into powder. I then minced 60 dried Psychotria Viridis leaves & 13 fresh Psilocybe Cubensis mushroom caps. All materials were placed into a relatively larger non-aluminum pot, with the addition of 5000mlgrms more of viatamin C. This was then boiled for roughly the same amount of time as the brew from Day 1...the same straining & re-boiling methods were followed as well. The liquids were then combined & boiled down to a volume of approx. 1cup. This also was refrigerated.<BR>
<BR>
Day 3:<BR>
 I fasted all day, as well as the 2 previous preparation days. I spent my waking hrs. reading & meditating through the creation of music on various insturments. When the feeling came upon me to ingest the forbidden liquids, it was already 9:00pm. I decided that such a combination of psycho-active plants was'nt anything to toy with, so I gathered up the manditory tools for a long night in the woods.(tent,water,cannabis,etc.) Before I left for my journey, I drank the extemely bitter MOAI/LSA tea. I figured that by the time I reached my destination, the effects would have begun to take hold.<BR>
 Half way into the thorn infested woods of the Natchez Trace, I began to feel nauseating, yet calming air of the brew. By the time I reached a spot in which I was happy with, about 30 min. had passed. I now felt that it was time to start out on the true journey, for which I had waited so long. The DMT/psilocybin tea was then removed from my bag & swiftly ingested to avoid prolonged interaction with this nasty shit.<BR>
 <BR>
About 30 min. later, the brew was beginning to taint my existance with CEV's, & before I knew it, vomit was upon me. I ventured off a good 30 ft. for the hacking in order to avoid smelling, stepping in, or interaction in any way with the fowl mess. The release of the brews was extremely satisfying & welcomed...I'm always game for a good puke session.<BR>
<BR>
After the vomiting, I smoked a few bowls of cannabis, & then everything was different. Within the next 20 min., all recollection myself, & the past events were gone. I was'nt able to see trees or plants any longer. Everything took on a new shape. There were even walls of patterns & light that appeared in front of me.(keep in mind that this was all open eye)There were images of life, light,& sound EVERYWHERE, but I was'nt able progress toward them. Every time I attempted get closer, the walls & beings would keep their same distance. I was able to hear 2 different dialogues - one of which I was able to understand, but the other was a combination of sounds so unlike anything I had ever heard that I almost want to say that it was'nt a voice at all, but the patternized walls making making visual sylables.<BR>
 <BR>
I had thousands of rational thoughts going on, with which I was explaining to myself what was happening in front of me, but none of them make very much sense to me now.<BR>
 <BR>
After I came to the realization that a human was'nt able to move about through this dimention, I laid down on the bare ground, closed my eyes, & was then able to watch the walls unfold before me. A great feeling energy came over me once I understood that to exist here, you don't need a phisical self, only the idea of one.<BR>
 <BR>
I must have wandered through those walls for an eternity...I was even able to make them shift & re-shape upon will. The entire time that this was going on, the ever-so-loud dialogue in which I understood was assuring me that this place would exist forever, & that I would meet with it much more in the future. This calmed me to no extent.<BR>
 <BR>
After lying on the ground in a timeless state, I regained the knowledge of where my physical self was, I realized that the multiple eternities in which I just experienced was only 5 hrs.!<BR>
 <BR>
I spent the rest of the night reflecting on EVERYTHING...not just my hallucinogenic state, but everything that ever happened to everyone. I felt as if all knowledge was handed to me for a short period of time, & it I felt very rewarded.<BR>
  <BR>
While reflecting, I did my best on setting up my tent, & building a fire. I sat smoking cannabis & watching the fire from my tent until morning - all of the time sorting through the overwhelming amount of knowledge I was given...or should I say loaned.<!--   End Body   -->

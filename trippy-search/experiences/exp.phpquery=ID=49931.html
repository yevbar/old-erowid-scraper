Prior to this experience, I had smoked pot twice without getting high. I was eager to learn how it felt to be stoned, and although I had made an approximation of how I would feel, I wanted the genuine article. <br>
<br>
It is August of 2004. I went to my friend Kevin's house. I was anticipating some reefer, for Kevin is a very frequent smoker. Well, at about 4:00, we went to Kevin's friend Evan's house. Evan answered his door, greeted us, and we went to his basement.  e all smoked a cigarette. I felt the mellowness curb my appetite for some pot, but still, it remained. Evan's friend Justin comes downstairs and packs a bowl.<br>
<br>
About 7 bowls later, I don't feel high. I was disappointed, thinking I was immune to the effects or something. I was sitting on the floor, and as I rose to make my way to the couch, I was hit with a massive head rush. My reality was crumbling, and I experienced a second or two of sheer panic, which quickly subsided into a mellow bliss. Despite this, it took me a few moments to realize that I was STONED. I grinned, and the smile would not leave my mouth. <br>
<br>
After watching some Family Guy and bidding Evan goodbye, we left for Kevin's. I was astounded. My thought process was completely overtaken by a desire for a cigarette. I mentioned this to Kevin, but it took a few tries to get the message across due to my incoherency. We turned and walked down a lightly forested trail. I was amazed. The trees appeared to pop out as if I was watching Imax with 3-D glasses. I turned to Kevin. 'Dude,' I exclaimed, 'This is like being in a fairy tale!' He laughed and told me to take it easy. We arrived at a gazaebo, where we smoked a few cigarettes. They tasted amazing, like caramel corn. We arrived home, and Kevin's mom had prepared some tuna casserole, the Hamburger Helper variety. I loaded up my plate, only realizing my hunger as my eyes settled on the giant pan of food before me. I took a bite. It was orgasmic, and I ate fast, consuming a plate of steaming hot casserole in what felt like seconds. <br>
<br>
After awhile of watching Saturday Night Live with Kevin's mom, it was time to go home. No one was home, and I celebrated this turning point in my life with some instrumental music. Sound flowed majestically into my ears. I felt the onset of fatigue, and laid down on my bed. As my eyes closed, I began to actually grow tired of the buzz. I panicked, thinking I'd fucked up and would be high the rest of my life. I was unsettled, but fell asleep anyways.<br>
<br>
I am now a frequent smoker, and love ganja. I no longer grow tired of the buzz.<!--   End Body   -->

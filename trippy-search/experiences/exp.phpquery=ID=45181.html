After reading up on this common stimulant online, I came across some pills with ephedrine (12.5 mg) and Gauifenesin (200mg) in them. I didn’t pay much attention to the Gauifenesin (expectorant), past experiences with this have given me no problems.<br>
<br>
4:15 pm – I downed 3 cups coffee.<br>
<br>
4:20 pm - I popped 6 pills, totaling to 75mg ephedrine.<br>
<br>
5:45 pm - The onset took awhile, and it came on slow. But it was definitely apparent when it did kick in, I was sitting at the computer reading other ephedrine experiences when I kept lifting my heels rapidly and making my knees shake up and down. I also do this frequently on MDMA.<br>
<br>
6:00 pm - I notice I can’t sit still, I start getting up to do little things. This is odd because I’m normally lazy. Pretty soon I find myself getting up for no reason at all. For the next hour I’m very jittery and need to be doing something. My heart is pounding like crazy too.<br>
<br>
6:30 pm - I’ve never done speed/meth before but at this point I’m guessing that this is very close to what those stimulants must feel like, or at least this is the closest feeling I’ve ever had to them. I can do pretty much anything physically active and have no fatigue after, so I went in my room and started lifting weights, my arms don’t feel tired at all after.<br>
<br>
7:00 pm – I am still restless and need something to do, the effects don’t seem to be wearing off but only getting stronger. I need to leave the house so I jump in my car and start driving with no particular place to go. Sitting down feels weird, I’ve got this weird tension throughout my body, and the muscles on the tops of my thighs hurt from shaking my legs constantly. At this point I realize another thing I’m doing similar to when on MDMA, I’m grinding my teeth like a bitch!<br>
<br>
<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</FONT> <br>
<br>
7:30 pm – I drove around, got gas, called some people, and didn’t achieve much just trying to find something to do.  I am going a little crazy doing nothing. The effects have reached a platue at this point. I finally got ahold of somebody to hangout with so I sped off to his house (literally sped, I’m driving alot faster than normal too).<br>
<br>
7:40 pm - Arrived at friends house, it feels good to get up out of the car and be walking/active again, the tension built up from sitting finally goes away, my heart starts pumping again and I’m full of energy. At this point I realize yet another simularity to MDMA, the thought of food or hunger never enters my mind. In fact my friend mentioned something about going to get fast food and my stomach started hurting a little.<br>
<br>
8:00 pm - We decide to go pickup another friend, I speed driving to his house as well. I’m a *little* calmed down at this point but I think its only because I sat down again, but that soon went away when we got to his house and I got out of the car again. we stayed at his house for a good 45 minutes, in which the whole time I was still full of energy and could not sit still, anytime somebody needed to get up for something, like get the remote or a drink from the kitchen, I would jump up and volunteer to get it. I kept finding reasons to get up (bathroom, lock car door, etc....)<br>
<br>
8:45 pm - 45 minutes into being at his house I couldn’t take it anymore, I wanted to leave. Houses are not my friends at this point, so we decided to go down the street to the liquor store, I wanted to walk but the lazy asses wanted to drive. So we drove. When we arrived one of the two friends bought us all energy drinks called 'X-drink'. Reading the label I notice it’s pumped full of caffeine, ginseng, guarana, and a million other energy things. We each down the drink, and smoke a cigarette. I don’t usually smoke cigs but I thought it would calm me down a little before the caffeine kicked in.<br>
<br>
9:00 pm - They want to go back to the house but I really didn’t want to, so I said I had to go pickup my girlfriend from work, which I did have to but not for another hour. So I dropped them off and left, I drove down the street and parked. Within 10 minutes my heart starts racing again and I’m sitting in my car listening to music. The tension in my muscles comes back but this time I've got tons more energy, the drink really boosted it all. This time I try to ration my breathing, I take slow long breaths to try and calm my heart down, it works a little but not much.<br>
<br>
9:25 pm - Still in my car sitting trying to calm down/sober up before I pickup my girlfriend in a half hour, I call back one of my friends and ask him what I should do to calm down and he says 'Whatever you do don’t sit'. This sounds like a good idea but for some reason in the car my music sounded alot better, I had tons of energy though and needed to leave so I through on a sweatshirt and walked off into the night.<br>
<br>
9:45 pm - 20 minutes walking, it really helps, tension's gone again and I’m feeling really good, walking really fast too. I’m just staring at the ground as I walk and I eventually look up and I’ve walked REALLY far. I look at my watch and need to pickup my lady in 15, so I start walking back, but its really far so I think hey, why not run? So I start running back to my car, and when I finally get there and stop to unlock the door, I’m not breathing hard, not really sweating, in fact it feels like I didn’t even leave.<br>
<br>
10:00 pm - I drive off to pickup my lady from work, finally get there and just my luck I’m starting to calm down, I still have energy but now my muscles are starting to get tired, and it feels really good to sit.<br>
<br>
10:30 pm – I got my lady and finally arrived back at the house, the place where I had despised being when on the ephedrine, now is like heaven! I go and lay down in my bed and I feel like I’m laying in clouds, I layed their half awake for awhile, eyes closed but still conscious, and eventually fell asleep.<br>
<br>
I slept real heavy that night and here I am the next morning and I feel fine, no hangover, I feel hungry but don’t have an appetite for anything. I'd say based on what I learned from researching the substance before I did it, I picked the right dose and everything came out as I expected it to. I was very pleased and I’ll use the substance again but next time to my advantage, when I actually have something to do. :)<!--   End Body   -->

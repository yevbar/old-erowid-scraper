Kratom Notes<BR>
<BR>
8:15 - Smoke one small leaf off a Kratom plant, No rush per say but a definite alteration of mental state upon smoking. Smoke isn't harsh, very mild pleasant. Tastes like oregano but milder. <BR>
<BR>
8:20- Decrease in body sensations/ pain killer effect like Vicodin<BR>
<BR>
8:25- Effects seem VERY similar to cocaine but with more pain killer properties. Agitated must move. Prune salvia plants. Pace around the room. Smoke another leaf while pacing around the room<BR>
<BR>
8:41- Where has the time gone? I could swear it was only 8:30. I begin typing this. Energized and agitated, the experience seems limited like cocaine. I want more but don't want to mix this with anything. No music enhancement, no visuals, clear head. This seems like another anti-entheogen like cocaine. No enlightenment just agitation. <BR>
<BR>
        No way could I sleep on this.  This may be good if I needed to stay awake to study. I want to type so fast I don't care about grammar at all. Maybe it would be good for studying but not writing.<BR>
<BR>
8:45-  Mild tactile increase. Lower than normal sex drive. I may be on the verge of a headache. Maybe I should masturbate just to see if it may increase orgasm.<BR>
<BR>
8:52- I'm eating some pizza. This stuff isn't suppressing my appetite. Wow, my spelling is fucked up I just made 5 corrections in this last sentence and it's still not correct. Food tastes like cardboard but I'm still hungry. <BR>
<BR>
8:55- Smoke another hit.  I feel a little psychedelic in this now around the edges but not much. Food feels weird in my mouth like on mushrooms, but still no visuals at all. This must not be very visual at all because even weed gives me visuals and if they were to be found I would have found them by now. Hands feel like rubber. I'm going to masturbate just to see if it feels any different<BR>
<BR>
9:07 - Finish masturbating. Erection was slightly difficult because of lack of sex drive. Orgasm was significantly increased however and my face felt hot/flushed and my heart beat rapidly for a few minutes after. I still feel agitated like there is something I should be doing or some other drug I could combine this with to make it more interesting.<BR>
<BR>
9:20- I feel that I the stimulant effects are wearing off. I'm going to do a balloon of Nitrous and see how that works.<BR>
<BR>
9:24- Nitrous intoxication is significantly enhanced, more than ever before, while on Kratom. I had some incredible insights into my psyche, mostly unpleasant.<BR>
<BR>
9:35- I'm leaving for a party with GBL in a bottle of coke. More later.<BR>
<BR>
By the time I arrived at the party the effects of the Kratom had worn down almost completely. There were no strange interactions with the GBL, as there are when combining GBL with alcohol or other depressant drugs, in fact the GBL may have had a slightly lessened effect on me. However, the GBL provided a nice end to the experience. Overall I'd say the experience is worth repeating although next time I'd like to try chewing the leaves instead of smoking them to see if the effects are different.<!--   End Body   -->

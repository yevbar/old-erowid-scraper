I have done salvia before, on several occasions. But this was downright out of hand. Not scarry or anything, just so incredibly bizarre that I had to think it out for a whole week before deciding to submit it. See I have my own house on my parents property, so this all started when they went out of town for a few days. So I rounded up some of the local hooligans and picked up a case or two of brew. I had already acquired some very excellent greenage(cost a pretty penny too). So we got to drinking around five or so and continued this until around eight maybe, intermittently smoking herb the whole way through. Some people decide they are going to go out and find some other drugs so I go along to see what can be had. Well that turned out as bust so I asked if they could stop at the local head shop a moment. I knew that in the past this place stocked salvia products as well as other herbs. But I had been out of the country all summer and what with these new laws I wasn't sure. But to my surprise they still carried it so I bought a gram of the 5x. The clerk was really trying to push the 10x but 5 was right where I wanted to be.<br>
<br>
So back to my pad and continue drinking. Then we roll up a fat blunt of swag with a good bit of my beautiful nuggets thrown in the mix. So now we are significantly blasted and maybe 2 1/2 sheets to the wind. While everybody else is just chillin me and my boy J step outside to partake of sally's charms.<br>
<br>
It must have been around eleven then, it was a nice night too, very cool and still. Not many clouds in the sky. I dump about a quarter of the bag into my glass pipe, steady my soul and mind, take a few deep breaths and try as hard as I can to burn the thing in one hit. It couldn't be done so I go back for the second and can already feel that metallic prickling sensation all over my body and especially in my mouth. The last thing I saw of this world was putting down the pipe and seeing the edges of my vision start to fade out. Well more like the million twinkling lights of reality were going out one by one starting at the peripheral and quickly closing in to the center of my vision until the whole world was gone.<br>
<br>
Where I stood was not my porch, it was not my backyard, or my house or anywhere I had seen before. I have had some very unique experiences with salvia, such as every time I smoke it I return to the same place, I have dubbed it plastic land. Mostly because everything has this artificial sheen about it as if wrapped in cling film. I briefly returned to plasticland this time but didn't stay there long, it was if I was ushered to a sitting position in front of a screen, or similar device. It started with my birth not seen from my vantage point as the birthee but from the midwife's. The 'film' then detailed my childhood, with specific events such as gaining stiches and breaking limbs, and when my grandmother passed away. It was all there. In perfect detail such as when I accidently shot this kid's eye out. The strangest part about it all was that I didn't see in first person but always from exterior sources, somehow it seems like it was always from above or where a normal person couldn't have been to see it all. Like someone had been chronicling my life from start to finish.<br>
<br>
I began to see my teenage years and all my screw-ups, arrests, and general bad decisions. But it also showed the good things as well, first sex, the birth of my niece, right up to the internship and out of country experiences of the summer just passed. It was beginning to feel like that life flashes before you eyes as you are dying. But no urgency, I wasn't dying, no fear. Then I was being shown my life in the years to come. Going to college, moving to a new state, pursuing careers as well as my dreams, and women and such. The strange thing about the women was that I never saw their faces or bodies, just eyes and a feeling of warmth, and connection.<br>
<br>
I won't go into much detail about my future life. I do know that I will have three children, will own my own restaurant one day. There will also be a very significant death when I am in my forties. But I will not die until old and gray. I'm not sure on the age or even how I die. all I was shown about my departure was myself as an old man with a gray beard laying down on the grass, then my hair begins to grow very rapidly, and I am shown in time-lapse decomposing and returning to the earth, where very small blue flowers take my place. so I have seen my own life. It's almost a let down. but I think it will be extremely interesting to grow old and see if any of this stuff will actually happen. I hope it comes true my children looked very beautiful and happy, I would like to meet them some day.<br>
<br>
Then the trip was over, it must have only taken a few minutes even though it was enough time to detail my entire life start to finish. I was sitting in a chair about thirty yards from where I had smoked the salvia and my friend J was sitting next to me. It was strange how the world faded back into reality the same way it had faded out. J said I had been mumbling about how he didn't smoke enough, and then giggling. Which is strange because I don't remember him taking any at all, and I don't remember walking or even the sensation of movement. <br>
<br>
After that I spent the rest of the night extremely shaken, and in deep thought for the entire next day. I still haven't got over it. Maybe I never will. But I still have about half the bag of salvia and haven't smoked any. Maybe I will rip some later and see if I can catch a repeat performance.<br>
so to everybody out there who thinks salvia is bunk, you might be expecting to much and not letting yourself go with the true experience. it is definetly one of those things to be respected, very highly, and taken seriously.<br>
don't joke around with this stuff i imagine if not careful you could really tweek yourself out.<br>
<br>
peace fro the other side,<br>
Mr. strange<!--   End Body   -->

<!--   Start Body   -->


First time, to start it off: <BR>
<BR>
Mindset: Calm and clear. Took some piracetam earlier in the morning so felt pretty good. <BR>
Setting: Walking around in a park, street etc. <BR>
Preparations: Clonazepam as always, just in case.  <BR>
<BR>
One day I stumbled upon some BZP which was said to be a slightly less potent alternative to amphetamines. Always eager to try new substances I poured the solution into a cap off a 20-ounce bottle. This was measured out earlier with a syringe and found to be around 150mg. Since I have experience with various stimulants (my favorite being meth) I decide to start out at ~300mg  (2 caps). The friend I was with did not want to risk it so he started with 150mg. The substance was a 1% freebase solution and it tasted quite horrible, like stale gin without the herbal part but that's an understatement. Anyways, I suggest mixing it with something (tea, coffee works well) or if one is knowledgeable in chemistry, converting it to Hcl which is much less harsh. <BR>
<BR>
T+0:00 It was a nice day so we went to a park. I felt this liquid do something to me right away but nothing significant so  far.  <BR>
<BR>
T+0:45 We decided to smoke some good weed and proceeded to get blowed. By now the BZP was nearly at its peak and I felt giddy  and high but also had a really 'healthy' feeling in my body as opposed to amphetamine which feels more like a 'hard drug'. <BR>
<BR>
T+1:00 Definitely at the peak now. The three of us are having a conversation which is extremely easy to do. I seem to be  more social on this drug or something. About 20 minutes later I felt some sort of a serotogenic effect with mild empathy  towards those around me and feeling very open in general. <BR>
<BR>
T+2:15 At this time we decided to do a little bit more, as the peak effects started wearing off. Still feeling great, though. NOTE: I came to believe that this substance works similar to cocaine : The more I do the more fucked up I get, so I thought it was a good idea to do more with this drug as it was relatively easy to control dosages.  I get up on another 150mg and am right back to feeling good and healthy. <BR>
<BR>
At this point the stimulant effect becomes more  prominent but still does not quite resemble amphetamine, nor methamphetamine. Just feeling almost naturally good, like I just  did my morning workout and am ready for an exciting day. We talked and talked about whatever, but again unlike amphetamine  the conversations were very honest and open. My friend was going through some problems at the time and when on BZP we did a  good job of comforting and encouraging him; this is where I noticed the whole 'empathogenic' aspect of it. After that it was  time for me to go home so I took the rest of the BZP with me and also some clonazepam so I could come down, be able to eat  and fall asleep without any problems. 4mg completely erased the effects of BZP, leaving only a slight stimulant effect on top  of being calm as a tank. Woke up the next morning feeling pretty good, no comedown at all, even in a little bit better mood.  This was my first experience with BZP, the one that started the three-month exploration of this substance. <BR>
<BR>
I don't know why I  liked it so much: meth is much more euphoric and amphetamine more stimulating but the serotogenic component of the substance  is what really got me temporarily hooked on this stuff. Over the period of three months I 'lost the magic' of this chemical  but studied it thoroughly and came to several conclusions. At lower doses BZP is more serotogenic while constant redosing will manifest stronger stimulation and complete loss of  control at high doses. I've done up to 1100mg a night or so which I do not recommend anyone do. This resulted in me running  around in a party talking to people I just met. I do not remember what I said to them and short term memory seems to be WAAAY  SHOT. THe only side effects that I experienced, however, were a slight stomach pain (from drinkin' this sh*t) and severe  visual distortions (especially in combination with cannabis).  I also do not recommend anyone try to stay up on this stimulant for several days. While meth seems to keep my brain clear,  BZP still wears it out so I feel 'cracked out' and after a while I can easily end up in a psych. ward as the  hallucinations and delusions might get too much.  <BR>
<BR>
Our camp found that BZP combines well with MDA, MDMA, Cannabis, Alcohol, Amphetamine, DOB, and DXM (DO NOT try this one at  home or ever). Supplements such as 5-HTP make BZP a serotogenic experience, not as intense as say 180mg of MDMA but still  very nice. Be careful with MDMA however, as the effects are synergistic. We once attempted a combo of 50mg MDA + an unknown  amount of MDMA (below 100mg) after taking ~450mgs of BZP. I had visuals which turned into very real objects: There were  dinosaurs walking into the room and some kind of an Alien walked up to me then dissolved into thin air. This is probably what  is referred to as 'amphetamine psychosis'. A combination with amphetamine, if done right can produce interesting results. For example, I ingested ~200mg of BZP and  about an hour later when the full effects kick in, did a small line or two of amphetamine. This gives me a strong 'rush'  where I can't get up for a while and feel like massive amounts of dopamine are intruding my brain. This lasts about 20  minutes, but the remainder of experience has too many combined side effects to be enjoyable. <BR>
<BR>
Alcohol always did the job for me when I was out of benzos and needed to sleep, with no side effects.  After a while I stopped getting the effect that I liked this substance for in the first place, so I decided to stop doing it  indefinitely. Tolerance builds up quickly and even though there is no comedown this stuff really weakens my immune system  with repeated use. It also seeems to affect the kidneys and really wears my brain out. These side effects are not  immediately noticeable though. The high from the substance comes in waves first the stimulant wave then the serotogenic. When  on the second one I might feel that I'm comin down and need to do more so BE CAREFUL! BZP lasted almost 24 hours for me; I would sleep then wake up still high. So that's my experience with BZP for ya....<!--   End Body   -->

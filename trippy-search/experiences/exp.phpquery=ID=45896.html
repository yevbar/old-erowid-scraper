<!--   Start Body   -->


I am twenty four years of age, and very confused and lost in my life. I use cocaine regularly or I guess most would call it irregularly, at least four times per week. Please note that when I say 'use' cocaine I am not talking about doing a few lines in the bathroom with friends at the local dive bar. I guess an example would be better used to describe this: My girlfriend whom I sometimes acquire coke for will do a few lines with me upon receipt, usually on a weekend. Then a week later I will be getting more and ask her if she needs me to pick some up for her and her reply is that she still has some left from last weekend. I on the other hand have re-upped at least three times during the week. I have never been able to occasionally due coke. So when I speak about using coke I am referring to the act of buying a gram or two and going home, where I proceed to stay up all night on the XBOX or PC.<br>
<br>
I regularly stay up all night and then head to work still high. You might be thinking: OK, so this guy is a heavy user, big deal. The truth is I hate cocaine. It has single handedly destroyed my life. I first started when I was sixteen and for the first six months managed to keep it pretty social. Yet by the time I was seventeen I was cooking it in a spoon with baking soda to make crack and smoking 24/7. I will not bother to go into detail about this period in my addiction, yes I do admit to being an addict, nor will I go into detail about the stealing from parents and neighbors or the multiple times arguing with the folks about the paraphernalia found in either the laundry or on my person. All I will tell you is that I eventually got arrested and got clean and relapsed.<br>
<br>
When I relapsed I had been clean for about six months. I did not try and deny my relapse as some do by trying to manage their usage. I dove head first into my little glass stem and in only two weeks at the age of eighteen I was in real jail, I had only been in juvenile hall before. I had plead guilty to armed robbery of a taxi driver in return for one year in county jail, five years probation and a suspended prison term of seven years. Long story short I was good (No coke but I still smoked pot) for about two and a half years. I moved out of the small town I lived in to a very large city. I began dating a woman about a year after my move and it just so happened that she was a recreational user. We lasted two years before the partying became a too often for her and I was becoming extremely irresponsible. I lost my job, and had started calling the connection on my own time. This was a big no-no in our relationship. We had always agreed that the only time we would get high was together at home. This was not the reason for our breakup, I am fairly confident she had no idea how much I was actually using.<br>
<br>
That relationship ended six and a half months ago and I think in those six and a half months the longest I have been clean is maybe three days. I feel like I am leading a double life everyday. My friends know I do coke and I hook up half of the people at the local bar just for a little side money. What they don't know is that I rarely don't do coke. As soon as my connection arrives and I get everyone's stuff out to them. I go home and sit on the computer and key bumps from my baggie and drink beer all night till I have to go to work the next day. I work at restaurant as a waiter so my schedule varies week to week. So when I am off of work all I do is sit at home all day getting high or sleeping if I have run out. This is what I really wanted to write about but I got a little carried away in the prologue. I have no motivation anymore except to get my next score. I am currently sleeping on a couch where I have been since I broke up with my ex. I make around two thousand dollars a month waiting tables yet I drive an uninsured car and my registration expires this month. I have to be out of my place tomorrow, the first of the month, yet here I am having been up all night and hating my life. All the while doing nothing to change it.<br>
<br>
Anyways, thanks for letting dump this rambling load of crap on you. It is the first time I have stepped back and looked at myself in a while. It felt very good to know that I was not in this self produced cocaine hell alone.<!--   End Body   -->

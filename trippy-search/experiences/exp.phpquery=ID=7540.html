I had found a source of 5-MeO-DiPT and was quite interested in it after reading reports about it, so I decided to check it out for myself.  I was most intrigued by the sensual effects it suppossedly had.<BR>
<BR>
I started off eating a capsule with 10mgs and waiting about half an hour.  At the half an hour point I definantly was feeling something and decided to snort another 10mgs as a booster... within minutes I was feeling the effects.  I was listening to a group called Olive with a great female vocalist and the next thing I know I hear angels singing to me.  It was the most beautiful and enchanting thing I had ever heard.  I got caught up in that for about 30 minutes before deciding to go out for a cigarette and take a walk around.  As I got up I was kind of startled when I realized that actually I felt very normal.  I went back and turned on the music and it still sounded like something from another world.  I also realized I wasn't feeling very sensual or anything close.  Nor was I getting any physical sensations.<BR>
<BR>
Walking around I was getting some slight visuals.. everything looked 'different' and there were whisps floating around here and there, but definantly nothing overly exciting.  I was really amazed at how clear headed I felt.  It was almost like I wasn't on anything at all other than for the fact everything sounded quite bizarre.  I thought I may have mistakenly been sent DiPT instead. <BR>
<BR>
After getting back inside I turned on the TV and the voices sounded about an octave lower.  It has been about an hour and a half into it now.  I got a phone call and that was very difficult to deal with.  While I felt normal, I just couldn't comprehend the distortion of the voices.<BR>
<BR>
At about 3 hours I was starting to notice my sinuses and ears were feeling a little plugged as well now.  (I've found this is really typical of 5-MeO-DiPT).<BR>
<BR>
The experience lasted maybe another hour and a half (4.5 hours total now) before gradually just fading away.  Just because I decided I would just stay up all night and try to work on some art all night, so I opted to take more.  I ate another 10mg capsule-full about 8 hours after the initial dose.  In about 15 minutes it came back on rapidly.  Then I snorted another 10mgs again.  It felt very much like it had built upon the doses I had taken earlier in the day even though they had wore off.  I was having fairly strong visual hallucinations now... somewhat hard to describe because there is no other substance I could compare them to.  It seemed as if colors and sounds were vibrating.  I also started feeling an ever more present body load growing.  While the rest of me liked it, my stomach was not enjoying the experience.  The music at this point was absolutely crazy.  Everything was pitched WAY down.  Still no sensual or extraordinary body feelings, however.<BR>
<BR>
Around three hours later (About 12 hours total), just because, I decided to take another 10mgs intranasal.  The sun was starting to come up.  It hit me instantly.  I was seeing a myriad of colors and hearing strange ringings and such.  I could move much because my stomach was REALLY unhappy now.  I basically stared at the ceiling for a few hours and was rather incompasitated.  STILL no sensual feelings or body feelings.  I can't remember exactly when, but at some point I fell asleep.<BR>
<BR>
I've tried this substance a few more times, different batches as well.  I never got any of the erotic or sensual aspects ever.  And I also never really enjoyed anything over 20mgs, too rough on the stomach.  Overall I look at it as something more comparable to clean acid that just happens to be more auditory than anything, and it doesn't have the stimulant aspect.  It definantly isn't a bad chemical, but it's not something to waste your time going out of your way to seek.<!--   End Body   -->

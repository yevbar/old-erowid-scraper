So, to start it off, nitrous is amazing, but the nitrous experience changed as I proceeded to do larger quantities more often.  At first, one hit off of the cracker was all that I needed to send me into outer space for what felt like an eternity, but in reality was only about a half-minute or so.  I would hear a 'waoo waoo waoo waoo waoo' noise, and music would sound more intense, and I would usually have my eyes closed just enjoying the visuals.  Mixing it with weed or DXM or anything else (beer works too, only it feels like a bit more hyper)intensifies nitrous that much more.  Doing nitrous while on alcohol and cocaine is a cracked out experience that I didn't enjoy at all, but I'm not partial to cocaine that much anyhow, the come down after mainlining it absolutely blows, no pun intended.<BR>
<BR>
Soon just one wasn't enough.  I needed two or three to get me to where one would get me before.  After that stopped producing the same effects I had to up the dosage to six in a row.  At the time, I thought that doing anymore than half a box in a night was insane, but it's amazing how much one's perception changes the deeper into an addiction they fall.<BR>
<BR>
When first doing nitrous, I only had access to it through a friend because they had the cracker, not I.  Well, I could fix that, so I went out and blew 50 dollars on a cracker.  That same night was the one that would send me on the road to becoming a nitrous junkie.  Soon I was doing 2-3 boxes over a span of several hours about once or twice a week.  I love to listen to music while on a nitrous high, it's so much fun.<BR>
<BR>
Eventually I fell in love with nitrous so much that I would go out around 8 pm, buy 2 boxes, go home and do them, go out again around midnight or so, buy 2 boxes, go out a third time around 4 or five in the morning, go home and do them, and if I hadn't passed out yet then once 10 am came around I would go out and buy another box for the it's-morning--and-I'm-exhausted-and-want-to-pass-out-but-I-have-a-serious-nitrous-problem experience.<BR>
<BR>
Wow, I'm going on for longer than I expected.  Let me talk about the experience of a nitrous binge for a bit.  Once I got to the point of doing half a dozen boxes in a night several times a week I didn't get the 'wah wah wah' anymore.  But the first hit is still the most amazing one.  I would suck it in, hold it, and then lay back and feel the beauty of nitrous flood right through me.  Then I would chase it with a few more hits.  It got to the point where I would sit and watch sitcoms or cartoons or music videos while on nitrous, taking a hit every couple minutes or so to keep the high going 'just for the full experience.'  I would almost always do nitrous in my room with a blacklight on and music or television in the background.  The funny thing is that I would have some absolutely profound thoughts that made  ingenius sense and then two minutes later, while I was reminding myself that I needed to remember what I was thinking about, I couldn't remember what I was thinking about at all.  Also, the feeling of nitrous is so much fun that I would sometimes pass out with the cracker in my hand, wake up a little while later to find some chargers left, do those until I passed out again and this would continue until I either feel asleep completely or ran out of chargers.  Sometimes I would even remedy the latter by going out and buying more!<BR>
<BR>
Nitrous isn't the best thing for short term memory, and even after being clear of nitrous for awhile I still find myself having weird memory lapses.  Also, the visuals are fun, and often I would experience spirit-like shapes in my room, like spirit women reaching down from on top of the TV, or other translucent people leaning against the wall sipping on beer.<BR>
<BR>
Now to the fun part, which I'm not sure if I should blame it on nitrous or the brand that I was using.  At the start of my binging I was using chargers that I bought from a local sex shop that was open 24 hours a day, but I can't remember the name of the brand that they sold (see?  memory lapse, and I would buy the damn things on a daily basis too).  Anyway, they would eventually start to give me a headache, my throat would become all scratchy, and I would feel extremely dirty a few boxes into my night.  Soon I started to develop a twitch in my neck while I was using them where my neck would twitch when I was resting, but if I got up and moved around then the twitching would stop, and it would only be temporary, so of course I continued to do the whippits.  A few weeks down the road the twitching would start while I was in bed trying to fall asleep (sober), and wouldn't stop.  Now I'm definitely going to link it to the nitrous because if I stopped doing whippits for a week or so then the twitching would eventually go away as well, but I did find that the twitching with the sex shop brand was much more severe than when I used ISI brand.  <BR>
<BR>
I just hated paying the extra dollar or two per box of ISI. Anyway, then the twitching started to come while I was driving in the car (sober by the way!  I would never do nitrous while driving, and I'm pretty lenient about driving around fucked up, even though I shouldn't be I suppose) or just standing around.  It isn't a noticeable twitch, it's not like my head was shaking all over the place, and anyone looking at me didn't  notice it, but I could feel it happening.  <BR>
<BR>
This is when I started to get scared and realized that I really needed to lay off the whippits or else start having some serious nerve complications.  As hard as it was, I gave my cracker to my friends to hold for me, and a couple of times I've taken it back for a binge, but now it's not so much fun because it starts up the twitching again.<BR>
<BR>
I could keep going on but I won't.  A couple of thoughts before I stop though:<BR>
having a large and steady source of income or a nitrous tank would have made my problems a lot easier, as the chargers are about 15 dollars a box and at 15x4x7 adds up to a couple hundred dollars a week.  I couldn't afford to do whippits every night of the week, but I still put a big enough dent in my credit card that I'll be paying it off for quite some time.  I really feel that I've lost something beautiful in abusing nitrous the way that I have.<!--   End Body   -->

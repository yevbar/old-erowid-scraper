I was curious to try this hot new chemical so I acquired some 5-MeO-DiPT, put on some music, and prepared to have a fun night.  I took the drug at about 11:00 PM.<BR>
<BR>
The effects came on in about 20 minutes and scaled up over the next hour.  The main effect was a fun physical sensation of warmth and heaviness throughout my body.  It was slightly difficult to walk around, as I felt somewhat off-kilter, but I was able to do so.  The first hour saw some nausea, but as long as I didn't focus on it, it didn't get too bad, and after about an hour it subsided. <BR>
<BR>
Mentally, things were more subtle.  I had some pretty intense sexual feelings for the first hour or so, even though I wasn't around any girls.  If I concentrated carefully, I would notice very slight trails and a subtle sensation that things were shaped differently.  The world seemed to be more attractive, almost drawn with pastels, reality just felt a little bit different.  I felt very alert and energetic.  There were no hallucinations and no interesting effects on my thought processes at all - I felt entirely mentally alert throughout.<BR>
<BR>
The drug had a remarkably long effect.  The mental and sexual effects subsided after about two hours, but the physical effects were very strong until at least 6:00 AM (seven hours).  Even after that stretch, I was feeling extremely energized and was unable to sleep.  I tried to sleep asleep unsuccessfully from about 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM, after which I enjoyed a productive, hyper day without any tiredness - I mainly felt 'strung out' and a little bit hyper.  The only physical aftereffects was soreness in my jaw, which took about two days to subside.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, 5-MeO-DipT was a fun, but not mind-blowing, drug.<!--   End Body   -->

Here it goes, humble readers.<BR>
<BR>
Mindset and Setting: I'm a happy person, I rarely get depressed - I have an SO and a buncha friends, I mostly do drugs to have fun and explore different states of mind. I did this drug at a party down the hall, about 15 people were there and chilling. There was trance music playing in the background, almost everyone else was on 2CI and passing around nitrous and cannabis. I only took 4-HO, which I specifically asked for at this dosage. Drugs affect me hard, and I knew it was a high dose. It was nighttime, about 3 am, with no responsibilities for a couple days. I'm of the mind that you shouldn't 'make' time for drugs - that indicates dependence. Drugs will make themselves time. <BR>
<BR>
Preparations: I fasted for six hours before, even though I wasn't expecting any nausea, nor did I get any. Word on erowid indicates that 4-HO only lasts 3 or 4 hours, so I didn't get any 'trip water' or anything like that. I also didn't prepare by meditating or finding trip toys. I am on no medications or herbs, except possibly some caffeine still in my system. I'm 20 years old.<BR>
<BR>
Dosage: Exactly 22 mg 4-hydroxy-diisopropyltryptamine, ingested in a gelcap at 3:15 am. It's two days later as I write this.<BR>
<BR>
Experience: I took the gelcap in a nearby bathroom and went to the party. I looked at some wall murals while my friends C and D talked about ridiculous things and did some nitrous. C says 'Wouldn't it be great if the first thought you had after doing a drug was to do more of it immediately?' We all laugh, and D hands him the nitrous again. Time passes. Half an hour or so. I feel an alertness in my flesh, an efferevescent 'thereness' that you can only know if you've done this sort of thing before. I look around for my friend A, who I had planned on meeting there. There's a floaty feeling in the center of me, a back-and-forth butterfly vibration coming stronger in waves. This is nice. This isn't DPT, that horrible WRONGNESS oh-my-god-what-have-i-done get OUT of my body NOW NOW NOW NOW~~~~~~~~BAM you're in a new world. No way. This is a smooth ride to the stratosphere. I find A and his friend B, and us three sit down in the center of the main room to watch a movie I haven't seen before. It's a cartoon, with the sound turned off and techno in its place. <BR>
<BR>
Time passes... When was I doing anything besides watching the movie and sitting here? I, surely, cannot remember. I have been laughing since the beginning of time. It is so funny. I'm thirsty but I do not require water. I've continually finished running a race, I'm exhausted but I feel! so! good! Holy brilliance, I am euphoria. Eventually the movie ends, but I am still way up high in the clouds. Visuals now. The movie poster in front of me, Reservoir Dogs, is swishing in the non-breeze, the characters in the poster moving back and forth in the frame continuously. I stand up. The final wave hits meKABAAM! I look around and freeze. There is an all-encompassing spiral everywhere, in and outside my vision, imparted upon the floor and walls and people and everything. I have a hunch, a hunch, the music is creating this world! My body twists in spirals, doubling back and forth, but I am very here, in this moment, watching people come in and out the room. <BR>
<BR>
BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM the techno is taking me over. Pure pleasure is shooting across my skin, tingling every vein and hair. My brain is fire, blazing trails of seeking madness every 2 and 4 and 2~ and 4~ and 2~!! and 4~!! music music music oh CHRIST that's strong and I love it all! the body vibrations, the tremors, they are created by and are continuous with music, with tactile here and thereness, oh where oh where are my friends? I stumble out into the hallway, and my friends A and D are there. I am out of my mind the most, they are fine. Words are exchanged, everything we say is hilarious and CANNOT be written down because it is too funny! too funny! my sides burst. <BR>
<BR>
After chatting for a while I notice the music from the room is pulling me towards it. My friends go away, I don't know where, the music physically pulls me into the room again, like an insistent child. Let me explain. There is no defying the music. It controls my muscles. There's no thought of 'must' or 'shall' move or 'will' move. I simply move. The music is. I am. I function only as a semblance of the sheer music will, and samely over-observe myself contracting and pulsing along the floor, the patterned floor, drawing near the pounding beat beat beat of my will. There is no revelation. There is no spiritual guidance. There is only control, and I have none. I am GLAD to have none. the music is the only god.<BR>
<BR>
*cough*<BR>
<BR>
Later on, the pleasure still tactilizes me and persuades me, but I go home to my room. Three hours have passed! massive massive time dilation is happening. It's crazy. I put on some bjork and close my eyes. Music videos manifest into almost-seeing, almost-being. Now I have control, and intense visions sparkle in my black black world. So many passing colors, so many passing nerves just sparkling and sparkling and sparkling. I wander to bed, and fall asleep into one of my quasi-world, and awake 8 hours later, rested, thirsty, and feeling GREAT! The world is new and I'm going outside.<!--   End Body   -->

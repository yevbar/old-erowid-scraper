I am 19 years old, but have a long history of experimenting with substances ranging from LSD, Mushrooms, E, Syrian Rue, Cannabis, Amanita Muscaria, Amanita Pantheria, Belladonna, and most things in between. There are many possible representations of the 'Soma' of the ancient. The four most common in stories that I have come across have been these four substances. I have taken them all seperately over the past 6 years numerous times, and finally came to the conclusion that they would play well off of each other.<br>
<br>
0:00 5 Grams of Amanitas are consumed along with 2.5 grams of Psilocybin mushrooms. 2 Bowls of quality cannabis were smoked, nothing too strong, because the main purpose was to offset the nausea that could be caused by the Syrian Rue or the Amanitas. <br>
<br>
0:10 4 Grams of Syrian Rue are ingested. <br>
<br>
0:15 1 Bowl of cannabis smoked, once again to prevent nausea and relax. Relaxation is key when using any combination of drugs, so that it doesn't take a turn for the worse.<br>
<br>
0:30 A strange feeling is coming over my body, which included slight nausea and a certain weightlessness and energy. The nausea was fleeting and left soon after it came, but the weightlessness and energy were something that I had never experienced at this level before using any of these substances on their own.<br>
<br>
0:45 The 'shining' began, as I like to call it. When metallic objects gain a certain motion with light and appear to be shining and moving even though they and the light are truly perfectly still. I left my dorm room to walk to the woods which are located approx. 1 and a half miles away.<br>
<br>
1:15 The remaining 5 grams of Amanita Muscaria are ingested. I find my way into the path that I was seeking after getting side tracked by the foliage that was occuring on the side of the road due to the beautiful season change from into fall in the great Granite State.<br>
<br>
1:30 Feelings of euphoria have now risen and are at a peak, as I feel one with what is going on around me. I see the trees becoming part of the ground and the animals that sarround me are restless. Birds chirping seems to echo through my mind for minutes at a time.<br>
<br>
2:00 It is about 65-70 degrees out, but I cannot seem to feel the temperature, possibly because it was perfect with just enough wind to cause visual stimulation but not physical uncomfort. I find myself moving my head at what seemed to be breakneck speed to embrace the tracers that are certainly coming from the Syrian Rue.<br>
<br>
3:00 I have made my way several miles into the forest, but have a perfect grasp of where I am. I am in the woods, sarrounded by nature and all of its greatness. I recall never getting sick from the Syrian Rue, which is a rarity because often times I do, the Cannabis seemed to have paid off. I find myself picking up small items, and attempting to pick up others which are not there, just recollections of items i had seen earlier. The leaves are falling down around me, looking like a waterfall of orange, deep reds, and yellows that looked like a fruitbasket falling from heaven. The Amanitas were clearly kicking in, because the visual hallucinations were getting to be very vivid. There were fields of cat-tails which lured me to them. The sound of them swaying was loud enough to be the roar of a pro sports stadium, but lacking the fury. The volume did not bother me, because it was meant to be.<br>
<br>
4:00 Hours have past but only the effects of the Syrian Rue have worn off, as the tracers have tapered off to nothing. It appeared to be a 7th inning comeback of the Amanitas and Psilocyins because the hallucinations became as vivid as ever. After recollection however, I realized that this might have been caused by the Syrian Rue wearing off, but more research would need to be done. The sky was becoming one with the tree tops, which extended down and eventually became one with the ground. I did not feel that I was communicating with them enough on my journey, so I sat at the feet of an enormous maple tree to recollect on my thoughts. The bark was moving a great deal behind my back, as if it intended to massage me. The tree limbs around me shook with fury as a large gust of wind came. I put my hands at my sides and connected with the roots of the tree, as I learned it's life story and I learned that I would be part of it forever.<br>
<br>
4:15 I realize that I have been sitting here for some time and was about to move on when I couldn't take control of my arms to move me away from this tree. I was meant to stay there, so I did. Seconds later I look to my left and there is a doe standing about 50 feet from me. I could not distingish reality from falsehood, but after several minutes of observation I came to the conclusion that it was there. I saw it complete its life cycle, growing in size and majesty. I pondered where it could have come from, whether or not it had a family and friends like I did, and whether or not it was as aware of me as I was of it. Not of my existence as compared to its, but if it did not think that I belonged there as it did. Midway through this thought, I looked up, and it was gone.<br>
<br>
4:20 After waiting to see if my four-legged friend would come back, I decided to make my way back towards the entrance of the woods following a different path. This path turned out to not be a very wise choice. As I was making my way through the thick brush, I found myself sitting in a large pile of leaves. I was lifting large amounts and throwing them into the air. After one throw, I fell deep down into the large pile and into a dark abyss. Something I had never experienced while on any of these seperately. I did not question what was happening, but I embraced it. The dark was slowly relit by my body above me and the deep red that was the leaves that sarrounded me. I found myself staring at the back of my shirt and not knowing how to obtain this perspective. I quickly found myself looking into my own eyes. I saw happiness and pleasure in the deep blue that sarrounded the enormous black mass that was my pupil. The black was easily the size of a quarter and I could see the reflection of myself through my eyes, as if looking into a mirror with one behind me.<br>
<br>
5:45 I had reached my final destination at the exit of the woods, and by this point most of the visual stimulation had dissapeared and the only remainder of the journey were the auditory hallucinations that came with larger gusts of wind, that sounded like squirrels fighting on top of my head. I made my way back to my dorm and fell asleep.<br>
<br>
8:00 I awoke from my slumber with a friend hovering over me asking if everything was okay. Apparently, I was having vivid dreams and moving my body great deals. I do not remember the dreams, but I wish I had. I had no hang over what so ever from any of the substances, but was still very tired and slept for the rest of the night soundly. Woke up again with no hang over.<!--   End Body   -->

On my 19th birthday, my boyfriend (we'll refer to him as T) and I decided it was a good idea to do acid. Previous to this I had done ecstacy and marijuana (not that day-but previous in experience). I was looking forward to having the mind altering experience everyone seemed to speak so fondly of. I took it at 4:45. 45 minutes later I was having difficulty paying attention to conversation, objects and the 'voice inside my head' seemed more entertaining. He sat across from me hidden underneath the blanket. I knew I was beginning to trip because the blanket looked like a giant couch hovering above me. This made me laugh. Then the trees began to look like Magic Eye pictures, looming towards me. The Super Fly poster began to move... so we went to Gasworks (a park near the water).<BR>
<BR>
VISUALS:<BR>
Acid was very visually pleasing, the world was beautiful. Colors became intense, vibrant shades similar to the richest shades imaginable of plants - what you'd imagine in a rainforest. At one point (when I began to peak) - a wave of color would rush across my vision, making everything that shade. However, it took a wave-like form which would only change what it touched that color. This reminded me of the beginning of the show, 'reading rainbow.' Also, I was able to pick up colors from the cement floor-of chalk written from who knows when. Everything pulsated, throbbing and waving at the same time. While staring at the ocean it seemed to create a giant wave, rising and falling, though the water was staying perfectly still. The skyline would envelope its roots, while faces and rolls danced within it. This sounds crazy, but it seems to be the only way I can explain it. It morphed and grew. I also became very confused about what country I was in. At first I thought I was in Venice!<BR>
-while at the water, then in the tropics when viewing trees that seemed to look like palm trees.<BR>
<BR>
Mental:<BR>
I felt like I was in a cave inside my brain. My ego and inhibitions regarding what I thought dropped completely. I was able to talk freely about what I sensed from T and the strangers around me. My people intuition was brutally honest, yet caring. At some point T and I were near the water where he explained how much he loved the water, boat houses, and birds. I was able to connect these three things and became T. I felt as though I were him, sensing all feelings, hopes, etc. i completely understood him, understood how others saw him, and how he saw himself. This was cool. HOwever, every girl I encountered seemed to be a bitch from hell. well, I only saw three women. 1. Cruella Deville driving behind me, sneering and shaking her head. I thought she was going to kill us. 2. Friend #1's girlfriend. She did not like us, but she later told me that she was angry about something else-so this was based in reality. However, I haven't talked to her since the trip, so I might have imagined this. 3. Friend #3's girlfriend. I swear she was crying, then being horribly rude and grouchy at T and I. I heard her say things such as, 'yeah... going there with you would be so fun' -but in a very sarcastic manner. I don't know if they were really being mean or if I imagined it. I sensed people very strongly - I related and understood - or so I think... How I saw these people and my reaction to the behavior effected me - I wanted to be the positive and steer away from what I saw as negative.<BR>
<BR>
Religious:<BR>
I claim no religion and am still unsure and confused about the entire subject. However, I sensed someone... While with T at the water, I realized i was watching him and felt an assurance for him - a respect for who he was (despite my disagreements about his views) and a confidence that he would be okay in life. Then I felt someone watching me watching T -this was the higher power. Faces began to float towards me while a swivel of wind kind of did a ballerina move in the corner of my eye. It seemed to be an obvious pattern. I saw him look at me look at T, and I felt so peaceful. Later on the walk-a light came down from the skies onto a beautiful bench on campus-it was calling me to sit there. It was very spiritual.<BR>
<BR>
Reflection:<BR>
Acid is very cool. However, I see how some might go a little crazy afterwards. Reality is changed and you begin to wonder if what you see is really there, albeit in a different dimension. I have a profound understanding of T. At one point we were sitting across from the blank TV, and the reflection showed us in the future, sitting together in a different home. This felt peaceful, though scary because I'm 19 and that is the farthest thing from my mind. However, I was able to take this in and accept it and realize that it wasn't a big deal in the grand scheme of things. In one word-acid is truly... enlightening. I'd like to try it again , but in double dose. At 1 I drove home (not the brightest idea), but am still alive. I was still tripping. I woke up 13 hours after consuming acid, drove around again and sure enough... the colors were still slightly VIBRANT... Acid is a beautiful drug.<!--   End Body   -->

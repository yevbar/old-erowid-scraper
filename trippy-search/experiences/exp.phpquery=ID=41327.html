***This experience report contains graphic descriptions of gay men having sex.  Reader discretion is advised.***<br>
<br>
I've been smoking weed for several years, and I've been using poppers during sex/masturbation for almost as long, but I never thought to mix them until a few weeks ago.  Usually I either smoke a bowl or two of weed before sex, or whip out the popper bottle.  No, I'm not dependent on either one to be able to have good sex, but it certainly makes it a lot more fun.  The best orgasm I've ever had in my life happened the night I mixed poppers with weed for the first time.<br>
<br>
It was around midnight and I was hanging out with my friend Peter.  Peter and I usually end up fooling around when I go to his place, because we're both really horny people, and with two men, there's really no one there to say 'no.'  Well, on the night in question, I had brought my brand new bottle of 'Blue Boy' poppers, purchased at my local den of sin (bathhouse), as well as my stash of weed.<br>
<br>
Peter and I smoked some of weed, and watched a movie.  I always have a great time watching movies when I'm stoned, so I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, though I can't remember what one it was.  After the movie was done, so around 2 a.m., Peter and I smoked some more weed because we knew we were going to end up fooling around.  We sat around chatting and enjoying his apartment (he's a fabulous interior designer, and we WERE stoned after all).  After a while, he put on a porn movie and we started jerking off.  Then I remembered my bottle of poppers and retrieved them from my backpack.<br>
<br>
We cracked open the bottle of poppers and Peter took the first hit and continued jerking off.  He then passed the bottle to me and I took my first hit. I inhaled deeply 4 times, 2 in each nostril.  Within a few seconds, I was struck with not only the popper high, added to my weed high, but also the realization that I no longer had a gag reflex, and wanted to suck Peter's cock really REALLY badly.  So I impaled myself on it and shoved all 8' of it down my throat.  By then my popper high was starting to wear off, so I sniffed some more.  I'm not going to tell you every time I took a hit of poppers, because this story would be even longer than it's already going to be.<br>
<br>
During the entire experience, I felt really warm and flushed, and my entire body felt good.  It felt like I was an amusement park and I wanted Peter to try every ride.  After I had had enough of being on my knees for him, we rearranged ourselves into a 69 position.  It was like all that existed in my universe the entire time was my mouth and throat around Peter's cock, and his mouth and throat around mine.<br>
<br>
After a while, I started to get that familiar itch, and I knew that he would be fucking me.  After suiting him up in his latex armor, I took another big hit of poppers, and sat down on him.  The entire room started to spin (in a good way) as he massaged my prostate.  I rode him for a good hour, snorting poppers and feeling warm and rushy and horny the whole time.  The room was spinning and I was spinning with it.  The entire universe consisted of just the two of us getting our groove on, while lying on his fancy expensive Egyptian cotton sheets, which just made the whole experience that much better.  <br>
<br>
This was the night I discovered that sex feels really good when you mix weed and poppers, but it also lasts forever, because like magic mushrooms, it's very difficult to actually have an orgasm when mixing weed and poppers.  Eventually, however, I could tell I was getting close, so I did another HUGE hit of poppers and just let it happen.  My entire body exploded in a wave of pleasure more intense than anything I had ever experienced.  I just rode the wave.  I had my eyes closed the whole time and I was seeing colours and shapes, even with my eyes closed.  Wave after wave of intense, screaming pleasure washed over me.<br>
<br>
When I eventually opened my eyes, Peter was looking at me with an amused expression on his face.  He then told me that for 2 solid minutes, I just sat there moaning and screaming, like I was having the orgasm of a lifetime, and I was.  After he had his own screaming orgasm, we cleaned ourselves up.  It took 4 towels instead of the usual one, because we were both coated in sweat and other bodily secretions.  I then went home and went to bed, and had wonderful dreams about having sex with Peter while stoned out of my tree and a bottle of poppers jammed up my nose.  The dreams were almost as good as the real thing.<br>
<br>
Since then, I've mixed weed and poppers many more times, with the same amazing effects, and I plan on doing it many more times.  Sorry if this story was too graphic, but I felt that in order to fully describe my experience, it had to be.<!--   End Body   -->

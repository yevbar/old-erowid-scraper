Recently I tried MDMA for the first time and had a different experience than any of my friends described. I'm (probably) ADD though, so many drugs affect me in unusual ways. But the MDMA made me feel more clearheaded than any ADD medication I've ever tried. So I thought maybe extra serotonin was exactly what I needed.<br>
<br>
I remembered that Wellbutrin both increases serotonin levels and can be used to treat ADD. So when I went to get my Adderall prescription renewed I asked if Wellbutrin and Adderall could be taken together. My doctor said that would be fine and wrote me a script for Wellbutrin, without really telling me anything about it at all. I was curious--I've never tried anything like this--so I got it filled (with the generic) and took one that very day.<br>
<br>
The prescribed dose was one 150 mg pill in the morning and one 8 hours later, but not too close to bedtime or it would keep me up. I took the first one at 1:45 pm and quickly began to feel its effects. Sure enough, it felt just like rolling but milder, including the weird visual effects. I felt clearheaded in a way I've never experienced on stimulants, like my brain was suddenly capable of dealing with and sorting out many stimuli at once. Normally just looking at store shelves can be enough to overwhelm me and it will take me forever to find anything, but I felt like I could look at a complicated scene and take it all in. It also had another effect, making me feel like I was truly in the moment, like I didn't need to worry about the past or future. I'm not sure I want to feel like that everyday, but it was exciting at the time because it was much like tripping or rolling. It made me feel sleepy, so I took an adderall and had a very productive, very happy day.<br>
<br>
About 5 hours later I realized that if I wanted to sleep that night I was going to have to go ahead and take my second dose. Plus I was kind of interested in what would happen. So I took a second pill. Within an hour I felt more like tripping than rolling. Colors were brighter, everything felt like a dream, and all my anxiety was gone. Time seemed to slow down, everything felt manageable. I checked the mirror and my pupils were huge. It probably should have concerned me that I was essentially tripping on anti-depressants, but it felt so good I didn't care. I wondered if I could go through every day feeling like that.<br>
<br>
But, I couldn't sleep until 4-5 am.<br>
<br>
The next day I had real trouble getting up, but decided to continue trying the bupropion -- according to the directions. I took one pill in the morning and felt really good. The lack of anxiety was almost scary, so I took some adderall to keep me on track. I still felt kind of like everything was just a dream, but it was basically a good feeling. That day I functioned like a real person, taking breaks from my work to socialize and feeling like I could actually focus on the conversation. It made my heartbeat flutter and my stomach hurt and gave me a headache but it still seemed worth it. I felt so fantastic and so optimistic.<br>
<br>
Some of my friends were staying up all night to get work done, so I stayed up with them. I took more adderall but didn't take more bupropion until 8 the next morning. And I felt pretty good the next day -- incurably ADD, but that was probably from the sleep deprivation. It no longer made me feel like I was rolling, which I thought was kind of a shame but perhaps good because I could safely drive even if I stayed on the medication.<br>
<br>
Two days later I was still not sleeping more than a couple hours a night, so I only took my morning dose. About ten hours after taking it I began to feel like I was tripping again, for no apparent reason. But, as the general sense of weirdness was not accompanied by hallucinations, I decided it was okay. Also, I finally slept. <br>
<br>
I still don't know why both being on and coming off of bupropion could make me almost-trip and it's worth noting that I've never done acid so it couldn't have triggered something like that. But using the medication basically according to the directions has been basically fantastic.<!--   End Body   -->

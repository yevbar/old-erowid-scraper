<!--   Start Body   -->



Received 5-MeO-DIPT in mail two days prior, mixed 250 mg. in with 250 ml. of purified water.  Empty stomach except for a small salad and a nutrigrain bar at lunch. Open and clear mind.  I'm in a good mood.<BR>
<BR>
8:15 PM.  Me and good friend J dose 10 ml. each mixed in with fruit juice. blech, tastes like ass! But then again, I know a drug is going to be good if it tastes like shit! We put on 'Deep Forest' an ambient/trance group from the rainforests (most amazing music to listen to while on 'foxy')<BR>
<BR>
8:45 PM.  Both J and me feel 'weird' almost like we are moving around in a bowl of Jell-O. Nothing mental, just a small body load.<BR>
<BR>
8:50 PM.  Our jaws and necks begin to tighten, and our stomachs begin to feel 'gurgly' we both take some ibuprofen and two imodium AD's. we then go into the T.V. room to get our minds off the drug. I get pissed off at the T.V. because it is too loud and annoying me. I recline into the living room to lay down and listen to some music, she soon joins me.<BR>
<BR>
9:00 PM.  We receive a phone call from a friends of ours, J talks to K on the phone while I wander the house feeling almost weighted down by the drug. Me and J take turns talking to K on the phone, each time we switch I feel more and more messed up. <BR>
<BR>
9:15 PM.  I am staring at the wood floor, and the grains begin to swirl all over the place, I am in utter amazement and am telling J to join me looking at the floor.<BR>
<BR>
9:30 PM.  We recline to the living room to listen to more music, we both soon notice that the pillows on the couches have come to life and are breathing, this freaks J out, so I throw them off the couch and kick them until they stop breathing. I then lay down and relax on the couch listening to music, I begin to notice some random CEV's that are very connected to the beats of the music.<BR>
<BR>
9:45 PM.  I sit up in a snap and look at J and all I say is 'Sex' I grab her and take her to the bedroom where we begin to rub and touch each other all over, I feel extremely sexual and turned on, and we are not even kissing or naked. We continue like this for nearly 15 minutes just rubbing each other with our clothes on. <BR>
<BR>
10:00 PM. Clothes are TORN off from each other, and rubbing of bodies continues.  We finally engage in 'the act'. I cannot describe the images and feeling running through my head and body at this moment.  I feel like the part of me that has entered her, is chasing after a small ball caught inside her that I must catch to experience and orgasm.  I am twisting, turning, lifting and lowering all in the pursuit of this ball that is being moved around by the beat of the music in the background. Groans and moans are coming out of us that I have never heard out of the most primal of animals.  Sweat is everywhere, the sheets are soaking wet from out bodies.<BR>
<BR>
I finally catch the ball, I reach a most outstanding orgasm which is greeted by the most absurd moan my body has ever produced, at the same moment J seems to have caught her 'ball' and releases the most primal female moan.  We lay still for a few moments catching our breaths, reminding each other every few minutes to breath. We then commence in the act one more time. This time our bodies seem to move with the music, we slip all over each other's bodies as we are engaged.  We are easily winded during this second performance, and decide mentally as one to rest. <BR>
<BR>
10:45 PM.  We lay linked together as one for a long time, sucked in by the music in the background. (Note the music is playing in the other room across the house) The music feels as though it is in my head at this point. I am receiving the most amazing CEV's ever. I am blown away by what is going on in my head at this point. I know where I am, and what I did, and feel like I want to get up and move around, but my body ceases to move a muscle, I am stuck! <BR>
<BR>
11:00 PM.  I finally get up, as does J, we get dressed and return to the living room with some fresh apples to eat. The apples are almost orgasmic tasting. As we lay on the couches and close our eyes, I immediately get sucked into another universe, the universe I like to call 'the FOX'. It is the music that grabs me as I close my eyes and sucks me into the FOX.  I feel as though I am on top of a grassy hill, with my knees bent up to my chest, and my arms wrapped around my legs, I feel like a child, I am in absolute peace and harmony with the world. I feel like I am watching my own personal fireworks show, but the fireworks are being orchestrated to the music.  Each individual beat melody, rhythm and sound from every instrument and voice has got its own little firework that I see in my head.  I feel so warm, tingly and cozy, I don't want to leave. <BR>
<BR>
11:15 PM.  I begin posting my thoughts and feeling on bluelight, very interesting.  Every few minutes in the real world, feels like 30 minutes in the FOX!<BR>
<BR>
11:50 PM.  J decides she has to go, she is afraid her mother will worry about her, I am concerned about letting her drive, but she claims she is not seeing these visuals that are so intense in my head. So I let her go, she stays on her cell phone with me until she gets to her home safely. <BR>
<BR>
12:06 AM. This is an exact excerpt from me while tripping'<BR>
<BR>
I love this world, I am being drawn in by all sides of what makes this world so beautiful, I Want to share this feeling with everyone right now, but I know it can't be shared by any One else at this moment, this moment that I am in, every second in real time feels like a Whole hour in the FOX! This is my new god, I am flowing with this keypad now, I hope I Can read this tomorrow, the music is so loving to me, it knows what I want and it delivers To me, I wish I could give back, I am though, the music comes out and grabs, slurps, Loves me and then draws me back to it through its loving sound. I now know what life is, Life is beautiful, I wish I could live like this forever, I wish I could share how I feel at this Moment with the entire world, I am at such peace, yet I cannot calm myself, I am Anxious, tense, but I am calm all of this is rolled into a little ball called q-tip, I love to read What I am writing, the colors are so beautiful, it feels like I am in the ocean with life Surrounding me, everything is nice, I know. I don't know what I know, but I know Something, and it is very crucial to the world, I must reveal it soon, before I lose it, I just Open my soul to everyone and I give every one swig of me, enjoy, I taste like fruit. Mm, <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
12:20 AM.  I lay down again by myself.  The instant I close my eyes I am whisked off into the FOX again. The visuals are more beautiful than before, the music I am listening to complements the show in my head so perfectly. I feel as if something is trying to send me a message, something important that I must reveal to the world, but I cannot figure out what it is.  I feel like my inner being is being sucked out of me and revealed to me in a way I have never imagined.  I soon realize how important I am in this world.  I feel as though I am lost at points, and that I need to connect to the outer world. So I know that there are people there and it's not just me in this state, so I call a friend C, she picks up and talks to me for a second, it calms me down to know there are people out there.<BR>
<BR>
12:30 AM. I remain on the couch and watch the show in my head, I am happy and at peace, I am learning to appreciate music and life so much more than before, there is so much more to life than meets the eye.<BR>
<BR>
1:45 AM.  I am beginning to come down, I am still having some CEV's, not as intense as before though, I am very awake and begin to wash dishes and do laundry!<BR>
<BR>
2:45 AM.  I get into bed and go to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
Aftermath: The following day I wake up for work at 7:30 in the morning, I feel tired but rejuvenated.  I am more alive than I have ever been. I don't feel cracked out, or like shit like most drugs do to me. This drug has taken a special spot in my soul! I will take a trip to the universe of the FOX again.  It seems to be a good way to cheer me up and clear my inner being. This seems to be a drug that I must be open with myself about.  I was willing to explore my inner soul and it was a most rewarding experience.<!--   End Body   -->

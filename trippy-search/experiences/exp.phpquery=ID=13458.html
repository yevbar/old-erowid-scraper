Just to let anybody reading this know, I really enjoyed this drug, but doubt I will ever do it again. I can see a very high potential of me making a habit of using it.<BR>
<BR>
Well, the day started out bad. There were unwanted people at my house, two of my very good friends were in the middle of a large argument and some unkind words were exchanged, and I just woke up on the wrong side of the bed. I was with my friend, J, during most of this experience.<BR>
<BR>
We started the day out running some errands, and went back to J's house. Neither of us had used Morphine before, and we both agreed that we did not want to inject it, so we decided to mix it with powerade and drink it. I put about 60 mg into my powerade, and just gave J the rest, and he put it in his.<BR>
<BR>
We sat down to watch a movie, and in a few minutes all of my powerade was gone. It took around half an hour before I felt the effects of it, and maybe an hour before I felt the full effects.<BR>
<BR>
I have never used any type of Opiate before. All I can really compare it with are marijuana and xanax. The feeling I got was the opposite of what I get from weed. Instead of feeling like I was floating, I felt like I was sinking. It reminded me of xanax, only a lot more intense. It was very calming, and I was coherent throughout the whole experience.<BR>
<BR>
After about forty five minutes, J wanted something to eat, so he went to the kitchen and grabbed a few slim jims. He offered me one, and I accepted his offer. I tried to open it, but couldn't. The feeling in my hands was just too intense. Every time I would try to open it, my hands would be overwhelmed with a relaxing feeling and I would just start laughing. Eventually, I just gave up and opened it with a knife. It was then that I noticed the infection I had from getting my handweb pierced wasn't hurting, as it had been all day.<BR>
<BR>
After a while, we decided to go buy something to eat, since there wasn't too much in the house. Everything seemed so slow. My body was in sync with the slowness, though. I felt as though it gave me time to fully cherish every moment, because I wasn't thinking slow, but yet, I was not having delayed reactions.<BR>
<BR>
When we got back from getting food, I went to the bathroom and noticed how small my pupils were. They were like tiny pin pricks in my eyes. <BR>
<BR>
About two hours after we took the morphine, J's sister called him on his cell phone. He told her that we had taken the morphine. She was fairly angry, and said that she was coming over. I decided this would be a good time to leave.<BR>
<BR>
When I got home, I felt like laying down and watching television, so I did. I closed my eyes, but wasn't asleep. For the next hour, I was extremely relaxed. I wasn't sleeping, but felt that I could not open my eyes for the life of me. I just layed there until I was sober. It wasn't a harsh comedown. I just eased into it, much like coming down on marijuana.<BR>
<BR>
I would say that this experience helped me a lot. Before today, I was very stressed out. Now I'm not. The whole time I was on it, I felt like I could have a conversation with anybody, and I still do, even though I am sober right now. I feel as though a social boundary has been broken down for me. It's as if something that wasn't there before is there now.<BR>
<BR>
I'm never going to use morphine again. I can see myself getting addicted to it.<!--   End Body   -->

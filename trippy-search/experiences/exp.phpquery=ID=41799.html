0 Hour<BR>
<BR>
I took 30mg of AMT orally.  I was alone in my home; a comfortable space with many distractions.<BR>
<BR>
1 Hour<BR>
<BR>
I made the classic mistake: I thought that since nothing had happened yet, I needed to take more drugs.  At this point I was apparently sober, and have no idea how I could have been this stupid. I took 14mg of 2C-E orally.  It is a substance I am familiar with and find very easy to control and enjoy.<BR>
<BR>
1.5 Hours<BR>
<BR>
I start to feel the onset of both psychedelics.  I feel a nasty stomach cramp and think that I will need to vomit at some point.<BR>
<BR>
2.5 Hours<BR>
<BR>
The stomach cramps escalate to extreme gastrointestinal pain.  I want to vomit, but my stomach is so knotted that I can't contract the muscles at all.  I also feel a huge need to defecate, but am unable to because of gastrointestinal pain.  I also become very cold and start to get waves of chills. My vision becomes altered fairly heavily, but that takes a back seat to my discomfort.<BR>
<BR>
6 Hours<BR>
<BR>
The gastrointestinal pain is still excruciating, and I am unable to move much.  I am still very cold and put on warm pants, a sweater, winter socks, and turn the heat up to 26C (about 80F?).  The entire physical unpleasantness continues to become harder to deal with, so I call a friend and we start looking into the literature to find bad combinations of the two drugs. I am only able to distract myself from the pain by concentrating on the task at hand.  We find no obvious reason there would be a contraindication for the two drugs.  However, AMT is an 'effective' MAOi, which is inadvisable to mix with a huge host of drugs.  Unfortunately, we can find no reference to a bad combination of MAOi's with any of the hallucinogenic phenylethylamines, and our research tools run out.<BR>
<BR>
9 Hours<BR>
<BR>
Finally, the pain subsides, and my body slowly starts evacuating itself of all solid matter.  Yuck.  But thank God. I still feel uncomfortable, but less like food poisoning and more like influenza. I'm still cold, but I'm finally able to turn the heat down to my usual 21C.  I remain rather jittery and unpleasantly stimulated.  Around this time I realize that I have actually been seeing and hearing amazingly distorted things, with a great variety of recurring themes for several hours.  It hadn't been important.<BR>
<BR>
11 Hours<BR>
<BR>
I am so stimulated that I need to take a long walk, so I venture outside.  I take a 2 hour walk and have a fine time.  My vision is still novel, but not overpowering, and my mind is alive with wonderful ideas.  I was reminded of years spent in Germany as a child and the German tradition of long walks on weekends (Voltzmarch).  I was in great spirits and as long as I kept walking the discomfort was slight.<BR>
<BR>
26 Hours<BR>
<BR>
I spent a number of long hours feeling like I had taken too much speed (which I've never done).  I was completely restless, but unable to concentrate enough to play music or write.  I watched a number of movies, but sitting still was hard and uncomfortable.<BR>
I ended the experience with a Valium and a glass of brandy and was able to force myself to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
Afterthought<BR>
<BR>
I slept 15 hours and awoke feeling okay.<BR>
<BR>
This was easily some of the most pain I've ever felt.  I was pouring sweat with cold chills for 7 hours.  My insides felt I had drank a bottle of Drano.  I've had food poisoning once in the Philippines, and it was horrible - but this was possibly worse.<BR>
This is a warning, these are both research chemicals, and they have not been studied throughly enough.  Had I taken a large amount of Prozac with the AMT would I have started convulsing and died?  I have had 'bad trips' before, they are usually mental, and not so physical.  This may just have been my 'bad trip,' but I strongly warn anyone against taking this combination of drugs.<!--   End Body   -->

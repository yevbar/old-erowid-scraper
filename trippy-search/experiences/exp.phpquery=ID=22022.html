Friday, February 28th, 2003<BR>
<BR>
13:45<BR>
<BR>
Substance: 2C-T-2<BR>
<BR>
Dose: Unknown (~20mg?)<BR>
<BR>
Set: It is the day before my birthday. I've chosen to trip this day because my girlfriend's schedule and mine align better this day than on my actual birthday. I've noticed for the last week or so that I've been getting depressed, but I've decided to trip anyway. This is my first experience with this particular substance, and phenethylamines in general as well. I expect this to be a fairly strong dose, based upon seeing how much is there and how many doses I was told were in my initial procurement. I've fasted for 24 hours beforehand.<BR>
<BR>
Setting: I am at my house, in my room, which I have cleaned up a bit so as to have a nice trip space. My girlfriend hasn't arrived when I take my dose, but will soon. My Mom's partner is the only other person home when I dose. I haven't smoked any cannabis before taking this substance. I forgot to unplug the telephone, which rang several times during the experience.<BR>
<BR>
Report: [T+0:00] I take my veggie cap filled with the 2C-T-2, about 15 minutes after I had hoped to. Within a minute I hear my girlfriend pull up and I go out to greet her. We come back to the room and chill for a few minutes. I start reading Dr. Seuss' 'The Lorax' to myself. It is quite nice, but then again I'm biased as I love Dr. Seuss. <BR>
<BR>
[T+0:15] I give S, my girlfriend, her dose of 5-MeO-DiPT. She takes a little less than I initially suggested. I then go back to reading my book. No noticeable effects yet.<BR>
<BR>
[T+0:30] I feel my first alert, some minor body load. I look over at the clock and it has been almost exactly half an hour since I dosed. I finish my book and while S reads Dr. Seuss' 'I Saw It On Mulberry St.' I go to the bathroom as I have that loose bowel feeling I also get on 5-MeO-DiPT. Like on Foxy though, my stool isn't soft and it doesn't really want to come out that bad, it just feels like it. At the end of the book, after all these fantastical build ups of what the boy saw he can't relay them to his father. When asked what he saw he was simply overwhelmed and couldn't remember it all. I commented to S that it reminded me of a trip and how it can be difficult to 'bring it back'. Then she read me Dr. Seuss' 'The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins'. By the end of the story she was having a really hard time reading it :-P.<BR>
<BR>
[T+1:30] The past hour my trip has been building in intensity. By this time I feel myself coming to the peak. I have some very noticeable body tremor by now. Looking at the back of my computer chair I notice very animated patterns, if not incredibly coherent ones. These remind me of some of the patterns I had the first time I took mushrooms, in the fact they were very animated, not their form. They do not really seem anthropomorphic as my mushroom patterns often do. S asks me for some crackers, so I head for the kitchen. However, on my way there I feel like I am going to be sick so I stop by the bathroom. I quickly vomit about 3 stomach contractions in about 20-30 seconds. Luckily because I fasted it is easy and I probably threw up about 1 cup worth of stomach juices and then was done. I rinse my mouth, wipe my face and continue on with my business. After I retrieve the crackers for S I excuse myself to go take a bath. <BR>
<BR>
By this time I feel I have a good enough feel for the substance and smoke the last 2 hits of cannabis in my pipe and then repack the bowl. As always the hot water felt exquisite. I was having quite strong visual alterations, especially trails and 'ghost images' several inches away from the real objects. There was some slight patterning as well, but not as much as I tend to have on tryptamines. I notice a sense of 'awareness' at this point; it is a feeling of being tuned into my environment, especially auditorily. I seem to notice and differentiate sounds much better than normal.<BR>
<BR>
[T+2:00] After sitting in the bath for about half an hour I decide I am quite hungry and retrieve two bananas then get back in the bath. I scarf down the bananas, enjoying them very much. The whole time I am in the bath I am more in an experiential mode than a thinking mode. I feel a headache starting to build at the back of my skull. I check for tachycardia and found my pulse to be normal. I never did get around to smoking the bowl of cannabis I packed while I was still in the bath, which is a pretty good indicator that I was tripping fairly hard. <BR>
<BR>
[T+2:15] I rinse off with the hand held shower head and then go back to rejoin S. She doesn't seem to be tripping very much and so I ask her if she wants a booster. After a brief moment of thought she concludes that she does indeed. My tremors have reduced by this time. S and I start fooling around and eventually make love. I found it neither hindered, like on the mushrooms, nor enhanced, like on 5-MeO-DiPT and 5-MeO-DMT. I notice something quite unusual for me...closed eye visuals. Typically I do not get closed eye visuals, but on this substance I noticed some. They were kind of pastel in color and looked like neon. They were composed of lines, a cross in the center with another one drawn around it. Around the crosses was a not quite closed circle composed of an outside, a middle and an inside. This design was repeated ad infinitum, as if it were placed there by stamp and then again and again and again...<BR>
<BR>
[T+???] I lose track of time as we lay in bed together. At some point I get a mango, which isn't quite ripe, but which I enjoy nonetheless. I find my thought patterns to be highly fantastical, usually telling a story. Due to my mindset many of these imaginings were not as pleasant as they could have been. Some were even upsetting. I thought about my relationship with S a bit, but nothing of practical use came up. When 'Pistol, Pistol' by D-12 came on it triggered in me a thought process about my love/hate relationship with guns. I try to be as peaceful as I can and do not want to ever shoot any being, however I've had this feeling ever since I was very little that I would have to fight for my freedom in my own land and this feeling tempts me to get a gun. Once this train of thought had begun it continued on to imagining me actually fighting in an apocalyptic war. Indeed, many of my imaginings were apocalyptical in nature, whether it be regarding my relationships, my future or what not. <BR>
<BR>
During this time I also felt very separated from S and unable to connect with her emotionally. We both mostly lay there in silence for a while, although I remember her remarking at one point something to the effect of, 'This is all so familiar.'<BR>
<BR>
[T+6:15] I am still tripping, but definitely coming down by now. I find myself better able to 'connect' with S, which is comforting. My headache has steadily increased as the trip has worn on. <BR>
<BR>
[T+7:15] We go and make burritos, which I have been longing to do for a while, but S is just now ready to eat. I'm barely tripping by this point. My burrito is nice and filling, full of fresh vegetables.<BR>
<BR>
[T+8:15] I am not tripping noticeably now. My headache however has grown very large. It is focused at the back of my skull and my temples, although it started, and will end, at just the back of my head. I am very tired and fall asleep quite easily.<BR>
<BR>
Summary: I found this substance to be fairly interesting, more so to me than 5-MeO-DiPT. I found it to be quite introspective for one. If I had taken any more I don't think I would have spent very much time with S until the very end - I definitely had a calling to be by myself. I also found the substance to be quite fantastical. By this I mean that it engendered imaginings and mental story telling. These imaginings were definitely just that and they did not have the 'flavor' of being 'Real' or of 'True' revelations. While I found this substance to be fairly visual I did not notice any tactile enhancement and very little auditory enhancement (only the aforementioned 'awareness'). <BR>
<BR>
2C-T-2 is interesting enough that I would be open to trying it again. However, its body load issues bother me. My tremor was quite strong for a while and my headache lasted most of the trip and for the next 3 days. While I suspect my headache came from the 2C-T-2 I cannot be certain of it. Perhaps it was because I had not had any caffeine that day. I would have to try again to see, but the headache was bad enough that it really makes hesitate to try this compound again. Especially when that is coupled with the rest of the body load I had - tremors, feeling of loose bowels, nausea - and how strong each was at this dose it makes me suspect, like I suspect is the case with 5-MeO-DiPT, that if I took a dose large enough to get to the really interesting spaces my organism would be so unhappy as to make it an unworthwhile effort. While I may get around to this substance again in the future for right now I think I will move on to other new horizons, both in the tryptamine and phenethylamine worlds, and familiar ones as well.<!--   End Body   -->

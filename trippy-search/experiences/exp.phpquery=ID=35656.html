Though not the chemical imbibing psychonaut that some of you here seem to be, I'm not exactly a neophyte either. So, it is with grave concern that I report to you a particularly horrific experience I had after ingesting a moderate dose of H.B. Woodrose.<BR>
<BR>
Prep:<BR>
<BR>
Since I wanted to do a solo test flight with this new substance I opted for beginning my experience early in the day, maximizing what I thought would be the comfort and security of daylight. The evening prior I had removed the fuzzy outer coating off of 9 seeds with a fingernail file. This seemed to take an extraordinary amount of time (1.5 to 2 hours). I then left the scrubbed seeds in a small plastic baggie overnight. Got up the next morning, ground the seeds into a fine powder with a coffee grinder, and then poured the powder into a shot glass. Poured in about a tablespoon of orange juice and a tablespoon of distilled water and I let the mixture sit for about thirty minutes. <BR>
<BR>
10 AM - Poured the mixture into my mouth and tried to let it settle under my tongue. After swirling the mixture around for a little more than 30 minutes, I spit out about 95% of the mixture (with roughly 5% escaping down my throat.)  I guess this would be considered a partial sublingual method. Sat down on the floor and began meditating.<BR>
<BR>
11 AM - Notice the strange, almost contradictory effects of drowsiness along with increased heart rate that are fairly common with strong acting plant entheogens. While not having much experience with synthetics (LSD, etc.) the effects I currently experienced felt familiar to other plant substances I've had.<BR>
<BR>
12 AM - Moderate intoxication sets in -- drowsiness combined with 'buzziness' in the head, along with heaviness in limbs. Decide to lie down after sitting at my computer becomes uncomfortable. Take a short nap.<BR>
<BR>
2 PM - Awaken from my nap in a great sweat with a racing pulse. Rapid thought cycling. Leg muscles cramping slightly. All fairly par for the course with LSA, or so I had read. Decided to get up and monitor my reactions and physical effects. Pupils widely dilated. Definitely tripping, but nothing too intense.<BR>
<BR>
4 PM to 8 PM - Gradual escalation of intensity for physical buzzing sensations, piercing headache, body tremors, rapid heart rate, streaming thoughts of darkness and negativity. Once I realize how the mood is changing I begin a quiet meditation, attempting to ground myself as well as to welcome the direction of any spiritual source which may be guiding me through the experience. I kept praying, 'Please show me what I need to see. I come with good intentions.' But, my visions continued to get darker and darker. Not hallucinations, but reflections on the horror and suffering of humankind. Other than feeling like I was going into shock, due to the sweats and hot-cold flashes, words like 'trippy' 'sublime' or 'spiritual' are the last words I would use to describe my experience. Words like 'poisoned' 'nightmarish' and 'psychotic' would be more appropriate. Really start to feel myself coming unhinged, not so much from panic as the physical and mental pain. At around 8 PM, roughly TEN HOURS after ingesting the seed mixture I hit the peak, when my whole world is wrapped in a buzzing, twisting, downward whirlpool of negative energy. It then dawns on me how much time has elapsed since the morning, and I began to fear that I may have done something catastrophic with this plant mixture. I couldn't believe it, but the old 'am I dying' cliche started passing through my brain.<BR>
<BR>
9 PM to Midnight - After experiencing little nausea up to this point, my body decided it was time to try purging the toxins from the inside out. I had eaten a few soda crackers a couple of hours before, along with 500 mg. of Niacin and a little orange juice. Medically, I knew that I couldn't have any seed extract in my stomach, but as soon as the vomit came up, I felt a hot electric current surge through my body from my feet to the top of my head, with my whole body vibrating from the inside. Essentially, I had somehow just triggered an even more intense experience. Feeling angry and betrayed, I flew into a rage. And, I began cursing whatever force was dragging me through this pointless exercise in misery. On the edge of tears and hysteria I simply dropped back down into my bed, accepting the waves of painful vibrations surging through my body and the horrific thoughts flowing through my brain. I briefly considered calling an ambulance, but experience told me that if I hadn't died after 13 or so hours, I probably wouldn't now. Around midnight I started to notice an almost imperceptible lowering of my heart rate, and my chills turned down a notch or two. Encouraged that I might actually be coming down I then dozed, thankfully, until around 1:30 AM.<BR>
<BR>
2 AM - Get up and see that my pupils are still big as saucers, 16 HOURS AND I'M STILL TRIPPING!  But my heart beat has leveled out, my legs aren't feeling as cramped, and my thought patterns seemed to be getting more even. I still felt an intense body ache and a piercing headache along with the omnipresent buzzing. For the next couple of hours, exhausted and furious I contemplate throwing my remaining bag of almost 50 grams of seeds into the trash. Were it not for a fellow psychonaut who experiments in the chem lab with different substances I acquire, I would have pitched them.<BR>
<BR>
So, how to summarize? What do I make of all this?  I really don't know what to say. Dose? Well, 9 seeds taken sublingually and then spit out doesn't seem that extreme. No other drugs in my system for weeks, so nothing to interact with. Set and Setting? All in all, I was calm and reasonably level-headed when I ingested the H.B. Woodrose. My condo and surrounding neighborhood were quiet and peaceful on the day of my experiment. I wasn't put through any stressful situations externally. <BR>
<BR>
What the Hell? All I can think of, all I can reasonably assume: 9 H.B. Woodrose seeds were introduced to my particular body chemistry and they were not my ally.<BR>
<BR>
Wish I could talk with some of you about this experience. I'm still shaken up by it. I've never heard of a trip lasting this long on ANY SUBSTANCE! What does this mean!? How is this even possible!?<!--   End Body   -->

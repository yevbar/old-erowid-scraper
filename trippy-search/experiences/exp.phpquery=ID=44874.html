I had Aquired two 20mg 2C-I capsules from an good friend who I had known for some time. After doing much research on the drug (or as much research is possible for the research chems) I decided it was worth trying. My friend had told me the come-up took one hour, and the trip lated 3 hours, little did I know that he had no idea what the drug was like.<br>
<br>
Having talked it over with several friends I decided to go on a day long journey with my girl-friend and my best friend of smoking and 2C-I use. my friend would act as our sitter, and my girlfriend and I decided to take it easy and just split one pill in half, giving each of us a 10mg dose.<br>
<br>
12:45 My Girlfriend arrived at my house at approx. 12:45, we deciced to take the 10 mg each, just because we never used the stuff and wanted to be comfortable with our dose. We devided one of the 20mg capsules in half and added the powder into a cup of water and downed them on an empty stomach to speed up the set-in. We then met up with my friend and started our walk into town.<br>
<br>
1:00-1:30 The first hour was a gradual come-up, nothing like any other psychadelic I had ever taken. I felt lightheaded and very happy but not intoxicated. Bordem began to set in so we made some calls and ended up making a deal to pick up some pot within 45 minutes.<br>
<br>
1:45 We decided to walk to the local shopping centre to get somthing to eat and wait for the weed. The walk there quickly became uncomfortable with the blazing 90+ degree weather and nothing to drink. My light headedness was not helping either, no real effects had kicked in, just everything seemed more relevant, kind of like the feeling of a minor pot buz. My girlfriend didn't feel anything but said that, she was sure she was not sober.<br>
<br>
1:55 My stomach was bothering me, the 2C-I on an empty stomach was deffinatly not a good idea. My body was confused weather I was hungry or just gasy, discomfort but nothing I couldent bare. no sign of enhanced effects yet.<br>
<br>
2:10 Finally it begins to kick in, I'm very confused and stuttery, no real visuals but just an odd feeling that I could understand anything and I could jump into the Consciousnes' of my friend or my girlfriend and precive myself as they precived me, a stalky skiny drug addict, this was depressing at first, but quickly became funny when I realised I was only tripping, we had good laughs and I was in a general good modd the whole time.<br>
<br>
2:30 The Pot arrived(late as usual) and we went to my grilfriends dads appartment in town(he was away and we had a key). We smoked 2 bowls out of a make-shift bong made out of a waterbottle. The 2C-I had not had any effect on my Girlfriend so she decided to split another pill, leaving me no choice but to take the other half as well.<br>
<br>
2:45-3:45? The pot and the 2C-I clashed very quickly. My friend left, and I had some good sex with my girlfriend. Afterward we began to trip very hard, the onset for both of us came on very fast this time (probably thanks to the pot). We were both very euphoric and had no real sense of time or anything, we were just lost in eachother talking as though we could understand everything we felt in every word.<br>
<br>
???-5:30 I felt as I had been lying in bed for days, just sitting there quiet, we had completely zoned out, and were now just in our own realms of our minds. The general feeling was still Euphoria, colors and patterns seemed more interesting and relevant, but the buz was more of just an extremely good and positive feeling, none to psychadelic.<br>
<br>
5:45-6:30 The Euphoria had not quit, we continued to trip quite hard. At one point I was going to leave to pick-up some chinese food but I got caught up with talking and touching and just general tripping that I forgot all about my hunger. <br>
<br>
6:30 Hunger set in, and I left and picked up chinese take-out. I returned to the apartment. MY girlfriend was laying on the couch on my reutrn telling me she had one of the most intense psychadelic moments where she could float around the room without leaving the chair. the pot/2C-I clash was intense and we enjoied eating and what not, no stomach pains this time. My girlfriend had said she was expierncing some cramps in her lower abdomen, but nothing to really be concerned about.<br>
<br>
8:30-9:00 The comedown, we really began to take on a pot-like burn out mixed with general exaustion from all the walking and intercourse, we fell asleep for a bit, then woke up and I returned home. It was very easy to function after the drug, I was minorly depressed because the day was so fun but the come-down had to happen.<br>
<br>
All-in-all the drug is very interesting. The Euphoria is one of the best I have ever expierinced, but no real visuals on my end of the spectrum. Just know ur body and your doses, as with any drug... happy tripping!<br>

I took the about 2 caffeine pills which contained 200mg per tablet. I started at 7:00 AM, I soon peaked at 7:40 AM. I was still only in 1st period of school. I felt the need to want to laugh, and listen and communicate with people. Today I spoke with people without fear and thinking about rejection (I am kinda a shy person). My hands began to shake a little, and twitch. My heard beat increased slightly, I could notice a difference in the beats. I didn't experience any irregular beats though ( which can  happen on caffeine) Time changed to me for some reason. It felt that time was slowed down a little, but I was super speed compared to it. My math teacher would write out notes on the screen and talk to us about them, I felt that she was going so slow. I also became more in tune with my work, answering questions teachers asked(which I never do, kinda annoying).<BR>
<BR>
The peak lasted for about 15 mins. Then I was in 2nd period, I began to have some stomach pains. They weren't bad, but it was annoying. All I wanted to do in 1st and 2nd period of school was move around and talk. I noticed that my walking speed and talking speed increased. I began to feel light headed alittle, not much. I felt I had so much power within my body, like a rocket ready to take off.<BR>
<BR>
I began to come down a little after 2nd period, so I took half a tablet (about 100mg). I thought I would get the same effects, but I didn't. I felt awake and alert. I still have a weird feeling in my stomach. I ate a little bit of cereal with the pill in the morning, I don't know if that was the reason? I thought it would be better with food. I am looking forward to a higher dosage next time. If you want to try caffeine in high dosages make sure you eat something because of the increase in stomach acid. Caffeine can also be very addictive. I drank a lot of water also, I heard from a biology teacher that caffeine removes water from cells?<!--   End Body   -->

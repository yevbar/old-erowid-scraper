I had read about AMT many months back and found it a very intresting chemical due to it's ecstacy & acid like effects.<br>
<br>
A good friend of mine who will call J had gotten a gram of AMT and said he would give me a dose for free so I was very excited. Many of my friends including J decided we would take the AMT at my friend T's house so they picked me up on a saturday at 6pm and J gave me the dose of AMT he said it was 100mg and that he had tooken the amount before so I went ahead and drank it down with some water.<br>
<br>
I asked J what his experience was like and he couldn't even explain the things he felt and saw and this excited me even more I couldn't wait for the experience! The only hallucinogen I had done before was mushrooms and the visuals didnt intrest me very much but the mind trip was very intresting. We arrive at T's house at about 7:00 pm and I still didn't feel anything yet but I wasn't surprised since I had read that AMT takes along time to kick in so I wasn't worried.<br>
<br>
My friend T had some nice techno blasting and at about 9:00pm I began feeling like I was comming up on ecstacy and couldn't help but smile and giggle alittle here and there. The music sounded wonderful and I just layed down on T's bed and let the music flow through my body it very much like being on ecstacy. This feeling lasted about another 2 hours and then began to disappete. It was about midnight and I was still laying down on T's bed. Things around the room began to look strange,like translucent waves were bending and twisting everything in my vision and it felt like their were butterflys in my stomach but my mind was still thinking the same.I did not feel like I was 'tripping' yet so I just laid back and enjoyed the small visuals I had.<br>
<br>
Now this is where thing's begin to get fuzzy... I am not sure how much time had passed but all of a sudden I completely came out of my body and landed on T's ceiling sideways looking across the ceiling and down and I was paralyzed but I didn't have any pain I just felt like I was in third person view watching all of this happen. As I was laying on the ceiling neon colored green and red clay began melting out of the ceiling and turning into little claymation men, there was about 30 of them all across the ceiling and they began talking in some other launguage that I have never heard of it was very low pitched. <br>
<br>
All the claymation men began ripping at eachothers limbs and melting into eachother while yelling in their own language. I'm not sure how long this continued maybe acouple minutes before a red claymation man came right up to my face and said 'AMT' in a low pitched voice and he slammed his hands right into both of my eyes. The next thing I can remmeber is that I'm laying on T's bed with my eyes closed and I began seeing all different kinds of zig zagged signs and letters and as I saw each one I had a flashback of a memory of seeing that thing before but I knew I couldn't have seen it before but then why was I remmeber it? <br>
<br>
I began predicting everything I saw and each thing I saw had some special meaning to me in my life in previous years but I couldn't exactly put my finger on what it ment. It was about 6:00pm and I opened my eyes and all visuals had stopped but I had complete blurry vision and saw 10 of everything. This continued for about 12 hours and through that 12 hours I kept hearing buzzing and what sounded like springs bounceing although I felt completely fine mentally. I never had any physical discomfort during the trip which I am thankful for. There are a few more things I saw but I honestly cannot put them into words which frightens me when I think about it sometimes. <br>
<br>
After the experience I had alot of trouble integrating it for alot of the things I saw and felt and thought I cannot put into words. I've smoked weed about 5 times since this experience and each time I smoked I had a sort of flashback and remmebered parts of the experience which actually makes me feel better remmebering more of it since theirs about 6 hours unaccounted for.I asked my friends what I was doing the whole night and they said I was on T's bed and that I was just laying their staring blank up into the ceiling and never said much of anything or moved at all. <br>
<br>
I think next time I will take a lower dose... I was not ready for this experience at all. I've become much better about dealing with the experience cause I just gotta put it in my head that I was on a extreme psychadelic chemical and that's all. If there's anything I've learned from this experience It's that I should always start out with the recommended common dose cause this experience was alittle to intense for me.<br>
<br>

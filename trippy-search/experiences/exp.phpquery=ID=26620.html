Mind altering substances have always fascinated me.  While I can't call myself an experienced tripper, I have dabbled in things like mushrooms, dxm, and of course cannabis.  Of those, my first shroom trip proved to be one of the greatest nights of my life, save for the stomach pains and strange physical sensations.  I'd familiarized myself with the effects of LSA a long while ago and have always been curious to try it, but until recently had lived at home and was too paranoid about ordering any.  However, I moved into my own place about a month ago and in my boredom last weekend decided to order some HWBR seeds.<br>
<br>
They arrived on Thursday after work and it was my intention to use them to provide a different Friday night experience than usual (i.e. not drinking). My first impression was that they were a lot smaller than I had imagined.  'I only have to eat 5-10 of these?  That's not so bad,' I thought. So I packed them away in a safe little space in my closet and went about my typical post-work activities.  But I was intrigued and wanted to just try a little, maybe one or two seeds figuring it would be mild and would at least give me a taste of what to expect.  I decided, after reading the subligual report, that three seeds crushed and held in my mouth with some water would provide just a nice sample of LSA's effects.  So I did just that.<br>
<br>
I held the three seeds under my tongue for a good half an hour and then spit them out.  About an 15 minutes later I felt a slight stoned-type feeling, nothing profoud, but perceptions were definitely altered and I was intrigued.  'What's the harm in taking taking two more, sublingually?' I reasoned with myself.  With a shrug, I prepared two more seeds in the same manner as before and held them in my mouth for about half an hour.  But then the urge came over me to just swallow and with a gulp, the tiny seed pieces were in my stomach.  This is when things got interesting.<br>
<br>
A few minutes later I felt a little dizzy and lightheaded, music sounded good, and I noticed a slight upward swing in my mood.  This feeling strengthened in intensity for a little while but wasn't too intense.  'Eh, what's one more going to do?' my already slightly tripping mind questioned.  So I ate one more and soon after was feeling slight nausea and disorientation.  I knew at that moment that the impending trip was about to be a lot more intense than I had originally bargained for.  <br>
<br>
To fight the nausea and mild stomach discomfort I ate a couple of antacids and layed down.  At one point I felt the urge to throw up without really having the urge to (let's just say it wasn't overwhelming but if I so chose to, I could have hurled) and headed to the bathroom just to be safe.  About twenty minutes later I knew I was tripping.  Colors were brighter, almost like a mild mushroom trip.  My thoughts were racing and I felt delirious. Best of all, my nausea was gone and only very mild stomach discomfort remained.<br>
<br>
The rest of the night was spent enjoying the trip, the feelings, the thoughts, the sensations.  A few things I really enjoyed:  First, I felt euphoric, joyous, probably the best I'd ever felt.  There was also a physical sensation almost akin the pleasant anxiety and ache I feel when on speed.  Music was great and different.  I heard things in songs I'd never heard before.  Sexual response was greatly impaired but despite this, without going into gory detail, I had some of the most intense sexual experiences of my life.  Though I couldn't cum to save my life, I was having multiple orgasms that were extremely intense.  And perhaps one of the best things about the trip was that I could assign a mood to anything.  For example, if I thought back on a good event in the past I would instantly feel like I did back then. Any situation I was in would be transformed, mood-wise, into a pleasant visit to the past. <br>
<br>
All in all, I really underestimated the potency of these little seeds.  The trip was positive and very enjoyable for almost the whole duration.  However, I found it extremely hard to sleep (it lasted around 6-7 hours or so) and ended up staying up all night watching movies.  Somehow I feel changed, but I know I'm still the same.  I feel like I went on a week-long vacation and am now left to reminisce and decipher what happened while I was gone. I feel refreshed.<!--   End Body   -->

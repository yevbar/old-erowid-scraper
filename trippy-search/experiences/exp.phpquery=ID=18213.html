I've only had 2 experiences with Salvia Divinorum. Both were interesting enough for me to want to explore this powerful drug further. Each time, I felt an undescribable sensation that I was experiencing something sacred, something powerful. Thus, I will try to describe the best I can my experiences.<br>
<br>
The first was this weekend when I took about 10 hits of regular dried leaves. I found the resulting trip to be intense, but too short lived. I knew something was happening, but what I could not tell. I grew very disconnected from my body. Everything grew unnaturally bright, but was not distorted visually. There was some auditory distortion in that every sound seemed very distant. While there weren't any visual halucinations, I did have what I'll call mental halucinations. I vividly imagined, but did not see, several people who did not exist. I spoke with them, but cannot remember the nature of the conversation.<br>
<br>
After that, I noticed something about the flowers in the garden. Something about them did not seem right, they appeared too bright, too large. This frightened me, and I ran inside and quickly calmed down. The effects quickly dissipated, the whole experience lasting maybe 2 minutes. At the time I was rather disappointed, as I had expected profound things of Salvia. I wanted the dissociative, visionary reactions I had so often read about.  It is these expectations that may have played a role in the mild trip I received. Nonetheless, I was looking forward to trying Salvia again. Little did I know I would get that chance two days later, quite by surprise.<br>
<br>
Tuesday morning (today) I awoke to find myself home alone. I decided to smoke a little cannabis before school. I took out my glass bowl, the very same one that I had used the two days before to smoke Salvia. Apparently, I had used the wrong kind of lighter which did not heat the Salvinorin enough to make large quantities of it vaporize and flow into my lungs.<br>
<br>
In any case, I smoked 1 bowl of high mid grade bud, took a shower, ate, and went to school. During the drive in, I felt very stoned with a hint of something different, something that didn't seem right. Suddenly, I was 15 minutes closer to school with no recollection of the previous minutes. Thinking this strange, I continued to school. When I arrived, I quickly headed to class, feeling mellow. Once safely in class, I enjoyed my high. Everything seemed serene, I was not paranoid.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, something hit me. It was as if my high vanished, and something else were taking over, some other state. My body tingled with electricity, then I suddenly felt disconnected from my body, as I had two days previous. Whenever I moved, it felt as if my body stretched and left a 'trail' behind. Not a visual trail, a physical, solid trail. If I moved my head, everything I saw would leave a trail on my vision. There were no visual halucinations, but everything seemed extremely bright as it had the first time I smoked. Sounds seemed distant, even my own voice when I answered a question from my teacher directed at me. I don't know if I had true 'Closed Eye Visuals,' but I definitely noticed some faint morphing color patterns when I closed my eyes.<br>
<br>
However, I quickly became extremely paranoid, which somewhat soured the otherwise intriguing and intense experience. I felt as if the whole class was staring at me and knew I was tripping, which they probably did as I was told later by a classmate that I had been staring straight down, and whenever I looked up my eyes were almost completely closed. Time passed extremely slowly, making an hour seem like 2.<br>
<br>
While I enjoyed the effects of the trip, I wanted it to end as I was on the verge of freaking out due to paranoia. When the bell finally rang, I was elated. I made my way out of the room to the peace of the library as quickly as I could. The psychedelic effects wore off soon after, and my cannabis high returned, with seemingly doubled strength. Finally, I came down altogether about 3 hours after smoking.<br>
<br>
All in all, it had been a very intense and strange experience. The peculiar thing about the trip was that it was so delayed, and that it lasted almost an entire hour. I suspect the Salvinorin had some kind of synergistic reaction with the THC, and this delayed and prolonged the effects of Salvia. I am certainly willing to repeat the experiment, though this time on purpose and with the intent of going deeper into the world of Salvia.<!--   End Body   -->

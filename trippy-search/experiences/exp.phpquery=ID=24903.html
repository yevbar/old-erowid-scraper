I entered this profound experience very foolishly... no mental preparation, no precise way to measure the 2c-t-2, after drinking a few glasses of wine... I had an amazing experience with dpt and alcohol a few days prior, and wanted to experience the same thing with 2c-t-2... <br>
<br>
I ingested the very rough estimate of 20mg at 10pm with a little bread and wine... the effects hit me within an hour, and by two hours I was tripping VERY hard, a 3+ level... I went to a club and sat at one of the tables, trying to make sense of my surroundings, watching the colors, profound altered sense of time/movement... I was relieved that I was experiencing no nausea, but felt unnerved being at this club alone, tripping so hard... like everyone could tell... so I walked around for a few hours on the streets, and suddenly I vomited in an alleyway, was sweating profusely, and began feeling like I had poisoned my body... I called some friends for advice, but could barely communicate... though it was nice to get reassurance that I was not going to die...<br>
<br>
the peak lasted roughly 4 hours, during which I felt like I was experiencing both insanity and deep spiritual awareness... the experience would have been fully positive if not for the very negative feeling that I had poisoned my body, unlike the body feelings of other psychedelics I have experienced...<br>
<br>
at one point I wrote in big letters in my journal, 'No More Drugs!', I really felt like I was going to die any second... my pulse must have been extremely high at this point...<br>
<br>
I smoked some Cannabis at roughly 2am (I was back at my apartment), which probably helped with the nausea, though it seemed to increase the hallucinations... <br>
<br>
I jumped from couch to bed, unable to sit still, feeling like my body was going to explode... took a shower, the water falling on me felt like I was on fire... bright red... went outside, smoked cigarettes to calm down... this lasted until 5am, and after smoking some more cannabis, I was finally able to fall asleep...<br>
<br>
during the trip, when I was not experiencing severe physical discomfort, I found myself approaching level ++++ awareness… but the body load kept bringing me back to anxiety/fear… I am deeply grateful for this descent into both heaven and hell, but I don’t think I will work with 2c-t-2 again… due to its very unpleasant physical effects…<br>
<br>
a side note: I have been taking Prozac for over a month, and I am not sure how this has effected my psychedelic journey… on dpt and alcohol, I was very relaxed, and had a thoroughly positive experience, which may have been aided by the Prozac, though I’m not sure…  my advice… be VERY careful with 2c-t-2… I learned the hard way…<!--   End Body   -->

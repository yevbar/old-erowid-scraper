My freshman year in college was an interesting experience.  My 1st year of college marks the beginning of my addiction to ritalin, and many other stimulants.  But, my story starts in High school.   <br>
<br>
I had been using cocaine (coke) on and off for about 2 years.  I started coke in high school, senior year.  In HS I used it about 5 times total, doing a gram in about a week.  Coke gave me an awesome feeling, I was very social, upbeat, and I always had fun on it.  I could never get addicted because I didn't have money to pay for any large amounts.  Anyway, after leaving High school I was fine, I went about two months without snorting a thing, and I felt fine.  But all of a sudden, I discovered someone at work who used coke casually.  Me and him became real good friends, goin to the gym together, partying together, and we also did ALOT of coke together.<br>
<br>
My friend actually lived Extremely close to our work, literally a 5 second walk, which made it easier for us to do coke at work.  We both worked full time and late shifts, so we made a lot of money.  We would use our money to buy on average one 8-Ball twice a week (1 gram a day, or 7 grams a week, total $350 a week).  We would be running back and forth like crazy at work, and when we felt tired, we would just go upstairs and do another line.  This crazy cycle lasted the entire summer, and I wasted about $1400 on the stuff in 2 months.<br>
<br>
When the summer was over, I stopped using coke completely.  It was pretty hard to stop, but since I had no money and absolutly NO connections, I had no choice.  It took me about 2 weeks to be back to 100% clean, no urges or anything.  Drinking Redbull helps when I have urges.<br>
<br>
My love for stimulants made me try a number of new things in college.  For instance, I'm sure everyone has heard of Adderall, and Ritalin.  Well I began using adderall and ritalin in college on rare occasions.  I only used them when I needed to study or write a paper.  They were awesome!  It made me feel instantly motivated.  School work was a breeze on these things!  Anyway, I began to grow a bigger liking to them when I invested in a Large amount of pills for VERY cheap.  I bought 120 20MG pills for $25!!  That's out of control.  Street price is a dollar a pill, maybe even .50.  So with my new lump sum of 'Smart Pills' I began using them everyday.<br>
<br>
I started off by swallowing the pills, but soon thereafter I noticed that it would work faster if I crushed them and snorted them.  I loved the rush, everyday I would wake up before class, snort a 20mg pill, and then be on my way.  After class the same thing, snort another then go about my day.  I really enjoyed going to class and learning while I was high on these pills.  The Ritalin became my 'Cheap College Coke' seeing as I couldn't afford real coke, and it gave almost identical results.  Anything after 20 MGs just makes me feel weird, almost in a trance but I am super energized, just like yay.  <br>
<br>
This was not a bad habit until I finally hit rock bottom after about 1 month of use.  I had caught a cold, nothing to serious but it kept me in bed for a couple of days.  Anyway, when I was sick I didn't snort ANYTHING. I went from using an average of 100mgs a day (5 pills) to nothing.  This became a big problem, the second day of going cold turkey I felt the withdrawal kicking my ass!  I was throwing up, feeling insane at some times, lost and confused about everything, depressed etc.  It was terrible, I was a mess.  I flushed the remaining pills, about 30.  I spent a week at my aunt's house over break to keep myself away from the pills, and it worked.  My aunt is SUPER anti-drug, so I knew if I told her or if she caught me she would kill me, so I couldn't do anything while I was there.  This helped me a lot.  Since then I have been a lot better, I still use ritalin since I have easy access to it, but I know I am not addicted.  I can go weeks on end with out anything, and I have.  I also curbed my usage for School work only (1 pill a day) or if I am partying and I wanna stay up late I'll do 2 - 3 pills max.<!--   End Body   -->

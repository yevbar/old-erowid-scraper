<!--   Start Body   -->


Background:  Other chemicals experienced include Marijuana, LSD, Cocaine, Rohypnol, DXM, MDMA, and Alcohol.<BR>
<BR>
Mindset & Setting: Well rested, fairly empty stomach, some muscles were sore from previous day’s workout.  I was in my apartment with no pressing issues or matters for the rest of the evening. <BR>
<BR>
Preparation:  A digital scale accurate to .002g was used to weigh out 9mg of 4-Acetoxy-DiPT encased in a pill sized capsule of ice for rectal administration (this is my preferred method of administration for MDMA).  Subsequent dose of 8mg was placed into a gel cap for oral administration.  Final dose of 15mg was wrapped in a VERY small corner of tissue for oral administration.<BR>
<BR>
Experience:  <BR>
<BR>
7:50pm – 9mg administered rectal,  30mg Grape Seed Extract (anti-oxidant) administered oral<BR>
<BR>
8:08pm – anticipation, but no effects<BR>
<BR>
8:18pm – some sensation of warmth, slight trouble with concentration, slight GI nuances, slight leg buzzing.<BR>
<BR>
8:30pm – slightly less of what was above, starting to think some of it may have been placebo affect, no pupil dilation.<BR>
<BR>
8:50pm – 8mg administered oral via gel cap with sips of cola.<BR>
<BR>
9:03pm – no change.<BR>
<BR>
9:08pm – slight stomach queasiness.<BR>
<BR>
9:35pm – 15mg administered oral in tissue with sips of cola.  No change.  Left the apartment to get a massage.<BR>
<BR>
10:30pm- have a feeling of fuzziness, like there is a cloudy separation between my mental being and my physical being.  My body, actions and voice at times seem to be one foot away from me.  I had sex twice, but it was not all that enjoyable, as this also felt like it was happening distant from me.  There is no effect on any of my 5 senses, and besides the fuzziness, none on my mental state either.  Body felt a little warn out and distant from me.<BR>
<BR>
12:47pm – went to bed, ability to sleep was no different than normal.<BR>
<BR>
Summary:  I had very minor effects from what is typically considered a moderate dose.  Nothing was felt or experienced that I would consider pleasurable or interesting.  Body felt tired, fuzzy, and distant, with no changes in any of the 5 senses.  The best way I could describe it would be the way I feel after an experience on MDMA or LSD.  Kind of drained and out of it.<BR>
<BR>
I don’t have much desire to try it again, but may give it one more shot at a single dose of around 30-35mg.<!--   End Body   -->

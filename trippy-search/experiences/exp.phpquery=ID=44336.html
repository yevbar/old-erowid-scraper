<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: It is unclear why the author came to the conclusion he ingested 2C-B. 2C-B has not been reported on blotter before.]</FONT><BR>
<BR>
After a previous evening of a rather frightening mushroom trip, I decided to go ahead and take care of business with some LSD and 2CB. The 2CB was sold to me as 'synthetic mescaline', as it has similar, but not exactly the same effects. I had woken up that morning at about 11 and had geared up with most of the appropriate tripping gear. For me that day, it was, first, to be completely free of any drugs or drug paraphernalia during the trip, as I had no babysitter but the crowd of a musical festival. Additionally, I wore long camo green BDU pants, a t-shirt, and most importantly, my green tripping jacket. This jacket is very important to me as it is my shelter from anything evil lurking in the world beyond. During the trip I would occasionally pop the collar and hide inside my jacket. I did forget my sunglasses on this trip.<BR>
<BR>
That day I was really just in the mood to disassociate myself from reality, as I had not had a very good trip the day before and was really interested in nothing more than putting some medicine in my body to cleanse myself of the mushroom toxins that I had ingested the day before.<BR>
<BR>
At about 1 that afternoon after a walk down Shakedown Street to gather the drugs, I slid the hit of 2CB under my tongue and left the paper to dissolve in my mouth. I had met up with some friends to help them find some doses (which wasn't hard) before we proceeded on our way to the shows. These guys were not babysitting me and I only hung with them during the beginning of my trip.<BR>
<BR>
At about 3:00, while laying around at a Gov't Mule Show, my world began to light up. Colors became sharper and everything around me became pleasing to thy eye. I danced a little bit and stood up on the tips of my toes, because every time I caught a glimpse of the landscape of the crowd of happy festival people I felt like I was getting rushes of serotonin in my brain.  <BR>
<BR>
At about 4:00 I ate one of the hits of acid. We then headed over to Xavier Rudd. I proceeded to run around in a field next to the stage and enjoy the rush of energy and joy that was flowing through my body. During the Xavier show I ate the last two hits. <BR>
<BR>
As we left the Xavier Rudd show, I began to twitch. We cruised to the Jack Johnson show and sat down on a blanket with my friends. The trip grew in force. I began to see trails. There were some hippies climbing the tree and stealing attention from Jack. This was amazing to me, as Jack just chilled and let everything flow. The hippies inspired me because of their devotion to climbing up the tree. At this point I became uncomfortable around my friends, as I wanted to go explore the environment. I told them that I needed to go and that everything would be OK. I moved up in the crowd and started making friends and jamming to Jack.<BR>
<BR>
The evening progressed and I began to slowly reach peak. This is when everything got crazy. It was right before Widespread Panic Came on, and I was tripping really hard, unsure of what to do. I was wandering around the concert field searching for something to occupy myself with. I was in a panic. Suddenly I realized that I should tell the world. I ran around sprinting into open spaces yelling PANIC. Everyone around me seemed to laugh at this, so I proceeded with my craziness. There were other people joining in. I think this is a pretty standard thing to yell before a WP show.<BR>
<BR>
The crowd gathered and I got a good spot about 30 yards from the stage. Panic began to play. The music completely controlled my flow and the flow of the other Acid trippers around me, as we all simultaneously joined together in similar actions. At one point I just started crying, letting the evil flow out of my body through my tears. A guy standing next to me was also tripping and he helped me stay alive. At one point we were dancing and he remarked 'it's cleansing, isn't it?' I could only agree. We danced and screamed and tripped our faces off. At one point they played the song 'Chilly Water' and me and my fellow trippers were relieved and felt amazing as the fans shook their open bottles of water, soaking everyone. The water proliferated the cleansing motif the whole evening had contained. The show concluded and the crowd dispersed.<BR>
<BR>
I really started to freak out at this point, having no point of reference. I bought a giant smoothie and walked about a mile and a half back to my camp. I was walking so fast I almost passed out, but felt strength with every gulp of the smoothie. The whole way back I became depressed and tired and my mind was focused on the futility of my efforts to help my life with drugs, and I had the idea in my mind that I was nothing more than another fan at a widespread show. At this point I resolved that I was going to stop doing drugs, at least for a while, after this night. This promise I have kept, sort of, but I have not touched anything for about a week now. So, all in all, it was a very cleansing trip.<BR>
<BR>
I made it back to camp, but realized that I had made a pointless journey, because I needed to return rather quickly to see Trey Anastasio. So, I smoked a bowl, grabbed some bottled water, and journeyed back to the stage. I pushed my way through the crowd and got all the way to the front (Within 5 yards of Trey). The show was amazing. I spoke to Trey during a break between songs and told him to 'remember the trick'**. He nodded and continued on.<BR>
<BR>
I love Bonnaroo.  ACID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<BR>
<BR>
**The trick is to surrender to the flow<BR>

<BR>
For this experiment, my fictional character (hereafter referred to as 'I') decided to try Mimosa hostilis rather than Psychotria viridis. I took an ounce of rootbark from BPC, and pulverized it with a stone mortar & pestle. I put this in a large pot and covered with about 2 inches of Evian water. I added 3 tablespoons of crushed harmala seeds, and brought to a boil. I added 5 droppers full of BPC's Voacanga africana extract (I figured, hey, they sometimes add the related Tabernaemontana to ayahuasca in the Amazon), and due to a fortunate coincidence, an aquaintance who uses cocaine was over and I added what I visually estimated to be 50 or so milligrams of that (they also sometimes add coca leaves to ayahuasca, and I figured cocaine's soothing effect on stomach muscle might help reduce nausea from the ayahuasca). I added about a tablespoon of lime juice to acidify, and let boil for about an hour, adding water and lime juice as needed to keep from boiling away. I let it cool for an hour, then filtered it through an old t-shirt.<BR>
<BR>
I drank it as my friends left, around 1:30am. Effects kicked in within 15 minutes, reaching a peak rapidly. I'd only drank a little bit, to see how strong Mimosa is, since my experience has only been with Psychotria. About 2 shot glasses worth. I didn't full-out trip, but the effects were just a hair short of being a trip. I was impressed. I'd need at least a small juiceglass full of Psychotria based ayahuasca to get this kind of effect. I dont know how much of this could be attributed to the voacanga, but probably very little. The cocaine probably had little to no effect at such a low percentage (we're talking maybe 2 lines worth dissolved in a liter of water). It feels no different from Psychotria, which makes sense since both contain DMT and neither contain 5-MeO-DMT. As an ayahuasca ingredient, Mimosa is qualitatively identical to Psychotria, but quantitatively far superior. It does taste far far far worse though, almost unbearably nasty. For the money though, there's alot more trips ber buck in Mimosa.<BR>
<BR>
It's 3AM now, T+1.5h, and I the peak ended maybe a half hour ago, right before I began to write this. Now, I have just a mild shroom-like buzz, like maybe eating a cap of some strong Psilocybes. I've always thought ayahuasca is very shroom-like, but the visuals are quite distinct. It doesnt give the warpy/ripply effects of LSD or shrooms, but rather things are more '3D', and things MOVE, not rippling or bending, but rather like one of those puzzles where you've got the little flat plastic squares, and you move them around and try to form the picture from the pieces (theres a square missing) - you know, those cheezy Chuck E Cheese type birthday party favors for 5 year olds. I didn't get that far on this (since I took a real low dose) but they were just around the corner. Everything had the '3D' effect and heightened colors, but the movement was confined to peripheral vision. The closed eye visuals were nice tho, altho I only spent a few seconds experimenting with them. I put on a CD of mellow Celtic music, with headphones, it sounds great. For me, DMT enhances music more than any other psychedelic. Especially acoustic music - perhaps this is from the harmala though, as I get the same effect when I combine harmala with LSD or mushrooms. DMT and harmala does seem to give acoustic music a depth that goes even beyond the LSD/shroom+harmala effect - and it is more specific to acoustic music - on LSD or shrooms and harmala, all kinds of music are equally enhanced, there is no specificity.<BR>
<BR>
I also should note I had some transient nausea after drinking the brew. I think it was due to the taste, though, rather than anything pharmacological. I never get nausea from harmala, and never got it from psychotria based ayahuasca. I just kept remembering the foul, foul taste however, and could feel the syrupy, diarrhea colored liquid down in my stomach. Lets just say, this is a taste you wont soon forget. Every time you remember the taste (or, God forbid, burp), its every bit as horrible as it was going down. The taste is the one thing about Mimosa that seems inferior to Psychotria... Anyway, I ate some hot chili peppers (piquinos - yum!), and that didn't work - usually does, even with cactus. Eating bread helped alot though, since the worst part was the feel in my stomach, not the taste itself. All traces of nausea passed by T+30min.<BR>
<BR>
Im going to go eat and enjoy the rest of the buzz (all it is at this point), but I'm definately eager to try a full dose in the next few days, and will post about it when I do.<!--   End Body   -->

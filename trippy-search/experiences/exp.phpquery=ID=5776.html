I have never really been a big fan of marijuana or alcohol (definitely a user, just not a big fan). I'm more into the instant gratification type of drugs, ie. MDMA, LSD, pain killers. I don't have to worry about smoking or filling my stomach with liquids I'm gonna puke up anyway.<BR>
<BR>
A friend told me about Marezine, and I was instantly intrigued by some of the stories he had witnessed and heard about. I mean, a drug that basically shuts off your waking mind and keeps your body and dream state wide awake? Christ, where do I sign up?<BR>
<BR>
Well, it's somewhat hard to find 'good' OTC drugs these days, especially in Washington, so I ordered two boxes of Marezine from an online pharmacy for four bucks a pop plus shipping. <BR>
<BR>
(I'm not going to go into detail about the effects, because it's pretty much like Dramamine and that's been pretty well documented here already).<BR>
<BR>
I ate by myself because I am a big fan of frying by myself, but that had to have been my first mistake in a long night of many mistakes. I ate around 8PM and it only took an hour or so before I started feeling anything. There was about 15 minutes of lightness and mild euphoria before everything snapped and I started tripping balls.<BR>
<BR>
I don't really remember much else too vividly, except for some great conversations with some really nice people who weren't there, and what was written in the police report . . .<BR>
<BR>
After everything kicked in, I felt like experiencing the outdoors, so I made my way down to the Seattle waterfront and got (God knows how) onto the Seattle/Bremerton ferry at around 10:30. I sat down, talked to a few people and then got really mad at the direction the boat was going in. <BR>
<BR>
I remember telling my 'friends' to go do something about it, but they had the nerve to disappear, so I stumbled around the boat until I found the bridge and proceeded to tell each and every person up there (imaginary and real) to 'turn the boat around because we're going in an illegal direction.' I really think it was the back and forth screaming of 'This is my boat,' 'No, this is MY boat!' that lead them to believe something was up with me though.<BR>
<BR>
Next thing I know, I'm in what seems to be the broom closet courtesy of three huge men. I honestly don't remember much after that until the next morning, but it's my understanding that I was screaming 'mutiny' at the top of my lungs for about 20 minutes straight while I was in there.<BR>
<BR>
After a fun day in jail and receiving a lot of shit from my friends, I'd still say it would be worth doing again. I would definitely require of myself a babysitter, and perhaps a lower dosage so periods of the trip aren't so faint, but I can only imagine I was having some fun that night. I probably won't be doing this too often though.<!--   End Body   -->

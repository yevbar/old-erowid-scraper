I았e taken the regular dose of both piracetam and Hydergine. I took the first dose yesterday, and other one today. While I앐 writing this report I앐 under the influence of the second dose, which I았e taken 1 hour ago.<BR>
I decided to take it after reading other reports and talking to friends, for 2 reasons: 1- I expect taking this 2 smart drugs with ecstasy pretty soon. 2- I았e been feeling great changes in the way my mind used to work. I forget things much more easily nowadays and sometimes I feel a difficulty that I never had before when exposing an idea. I앐 sure this symptoms are due to long term uses of marijuana, ecstasy and alcohol.<BR>
<BR>
But let's get to my experience. I slept only few hours, and I was feeling pretty tired when I took the dose yesterday. after about 40 minutes, I felt much less tired and I was extremely alert. Then, I went to meet my friends in a pub near my place.  Talking to them I couldn앖 stop talking. The ideas flew so easily, and my arguments seemed so convincing that I saw the old me again. (I앐 a very inteligent person, my IQ is 152 and, besides, I앐 a jornalist, argumentation is my best quality. But nowadays I았e been feeling I lost part of it.)<BR>
<BR>
I smoke a lot, but don앖 feel like smoking that much under the influence. I also drink a lot, but I wasn앖 feeling like drinking either. Nevertheless, I drank anyway - and I completely disrecommend that. You get drunk much more quickly, and when drunk under piracetam and hydergine, the easy flow of thoughts becomes confused and uncomfortable. Also, I started to feel a little nausea. Not like the ones I get when I앐 really, really drunk. But a nausea that I once felt under ecstasy - like if I had a air ball stuck in my throat, and I desperately needed to burp.<BR>
<BR>
But now, under only piracetam and hydergine, here in my work, I앐 extremely happy with what I feeling. Ideas flow easily, I have just written a cover issue that I앐 really proud of, like once I was of every paper of mine. I앐 the old me again, and that makes me feel extremely self-conscious and happy. I feel none of the posible side efects, like headaches or nausea.  The only thing I feel is that I앐 alert, concentrated and thinking clearly.<!--   End Body   -->

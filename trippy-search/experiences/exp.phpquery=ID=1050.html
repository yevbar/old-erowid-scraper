I'm the kind of person who'll try anything once-- acid, 'shrooms, x, you name it, I've given it a whirl. So when I read on the Internet that the myristicin in nutmeg is a psychotropic, I thought to myself, 'Now, why not??'<BR>
<BR>
Well, I mosied down to the health food store and bought a bag of whole nutmeg nuts--Indian was the only kind they had, so that's what I got--and the cashier lady looked at me as if she would've liked to have known just how many pumpkin pies I was planning on making in early April, but she didn't say anything, to my relief.<BR>
<BR>
Common sense told me that, with my weak stomach and deathly gag reflex, chewing the shit whole or grinding it up like a headache powder was not going to be the thing to do. Therefore I chopped the nuts into thirds, boiled them in a little better than a cup of water, and then let my sickly brew simmer on low for oh, say SIX HOURS. I strained the stuff in a collander, let it cool, and then noticed this brownish-white muck around the edges of the pan; I figured I had better let that redissolve so I got it hot again and then poured the nutmeg-water over a Twining's Earl Grey teabag (you know, the kind the Queen of England uses). I then imbibed my cup of goodness and set about to wait for the effects to set in.<BR>
<BR>
I watched TV for about forty-five minutes, all by my lonesome, and noticed after that length of time that I was beginning to intensely concentrate on everything that crossed my mind without really trying to. I know that sounds fucked up, but that's just how it seemed to me. I started to stare at everything that my eyes passed over, and I started listening intently for nothing in particular. Don't get me wrong--I wasn't 'seeing things' or 'hearing things' in any sense of the term--I just had this sort of heightened awareness that I couldn't shake. I got online and downloaded a couple of MP3's; this took about twenty more minutes, during which time the intense concentration seemed to wax and wane irregularly. I had worked all day that day, so I was beginning to catch the sleepies, and as I got sleepy I began to do all sorts of little, stupid things like getting up and then instantly not being able to remember why, but still nothing I would classify as a 'buzz' or abnormal bodily sensation of any kind. <BR>
<BR>
My silly actions freaked me out a little, I guess, and the sleepies left me as I found myself sitting in front of the computer wondering what in God's name I was doing. It had been close to an hour and a half since I'd ingested the tea, and I was really beginning to think I'd been duped by an urban myth when the strangest thing happened.<BR>
<BR>
I was on my way to the kitchen from the study where the computer is when, suddenly, as if a bolt of metaphysical lightning had descended from the sky and made itself at home in my parietal lobe, I became unable to walk in a straight line. I felt instantly drunk, and yet not drunk at all as far as the dizzy, sluggish sensations of normal intoxication go. <BR>
<BR>
At that point a buzz unlike anything I'd ever experienced began to descend upon me and kept increasing with agonizing understated persistence for the next several hours. I watched TV again, this time the evening news, and I felt unable to concentrate on the actual program while at the same time being unable to stop staring at the TV.  As the faux-buzz progressed I started getting this really annoying ringing in my ears, something which NEVER and I mean NEVER happens to me, and in my head the sound of the ringing kept somehow warping into these little fairy-voices which were chanting in some language I couldn't understand. With no regularity at all these weird distortions of perception seemed to come and go; sometimes I could control it, and sometimes I was too dazed to care.<BR>
<BR>
Eventually I really did get too sleepy to stay awake, so I stumbled to my bedroom (well, I stopped by the bathroom first and nearly SHIT on myself when I saw how red my eyes were, like I had smoked a pound of grass [N.B. I guess the only real reason I did this is because I DIDN'T have any grass]) and crashed upon my cat fuzz-covered bed until five thirty the next morning, when I woke up and felt so shitty that I instinctively passed out in the same breath I awoke with.<BR>
<BR>
Thank holy JESUS that I was off the next day, because I spent all damn day in bed so thirsty I could drink my own urine but too biologically lethargic to engineer anything of the sort. My fiancée came over for dinner, and, needless to say, SHE did the cooking.  I went back to work the next day and felt fine; I had a little trouble concentrating as I have a number-crunching job, but I played my inefficiency off as a 'bad weekend' (the vaguer the excuse, the better, am I right??) and recovered completely after another good night's rest.<BR>
<BR>
Would I recommend nutmeg?? I think that everyone who's interested in that type of thing should at least try it, because it is a *really* different experience. I think that, in combination with shrooms and/or mj, some of the finer qualities of myristicin et al. might come to light more fully.<BR>
<BR>
But it won't be something I repeat again.  Not for a while, at least. Like someone else commented, it's just too much bullshit for too little action to make it something anyone sane would do on a regular basis. But I can't deny it was definitely interesting. Thanks for reading, and I hope I gave everyone some halfway useful or at least partially interesting info. :-)<!--   End Body   -->

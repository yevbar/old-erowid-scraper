From 12:30am - 1:54pm the next day:<BR>
<BR>
The hardest trip I've ever had, the scariest trip I've ever had... I decided to snort some old chemicals I had. I thought the chemical was not as potent due to the brownish tint that had been acquired from time. I neglected to look for dosage requirements, all I could remember was the last time I did this chemical I had to do a lot to get any type of different mind set. So, I measured what I thought was 20mg of 5-meo-amt and snorted it. <BR>
<BR>
In 5 to 10 minutes I could barely focus on my monitor. I immediately went downstairs feeling very very (emphasis on very) dizzy, and began to throw up, I went upstairs and the feeling persisted. Did I take too much I asked myself. Yes, but not to worry. I was as mentally and physically prepared as I could be, getting ready to puke until the drug had gotten itself out of my system. I think it might have been around 1..to 1:30am when this started. I remember sitting on my bathroom floor for quite some time, puking, and drinking water. At 3am I went back upstairs, still feeling very very dizzy, only with intense visuals now, ones I've never seen before. I could only compare it to a scary movie. I remember sitting on my couch after going upstairs, helpless, restless, fading in and out of my mind, this world. I remember looking at the time on my lcd laptop monitor, and text in my mIRC window, whenever I tilted my head a certain way, the text would garble, kind of like when a scary movie goes horribly wrong, and the screen vibrates as horror prevails. The light was on in my room, and for a second I thought my glasses were fogged, the entire room looked like it was foggy, had to take my glasses off to find that it was just me. I could not function at all, and felt very nausous. I wanted it to stop, but knew time was the only thing between that. <BR>
<BR>
At 4 I got up, even though the throwing up stopped I would cough every once in awhile, every time I coughed, I felt like throwing up again. I puked one last time @ 4am, the nausea had stopped for the most part, my stomach would still move around gasses and make me wanna burp/cough/puke. <BR>
<BR>
Shortly after I decided to play some quake2/ra2 and listen to music. I knew it was the only thing that could keep me sane in the hours of tripping that were ahead of me. Once I started up q2 I could swear something was wrong. Everything felt different, completely different. After I got used to it I started to hit every shot I made. People were calling me a bot. Everything made perfect sense when it came to predicting. I couldn't miss, even if I wanted to, I’d pull off some crazy 180 degree rail shot between two boxes. This made me feel very good, couldn't stop laughing. I played this game for quite some time, probably until 11:00am ish in the morning.<BR>
<BR>
3:30pm, couldn't go to sleep, watched a movie on comedy central, drama/comedy...what a combo - I loved it<BR>
<BR>
Now I’m tired - I'm going to sleep!<BR>
<BR>
Overall - I did way too much, specially insufflated making it more intense. The first 4 hours of the trip was pure insanity/hell for my mind. After the nausea went away I started to have fun.<!--   End Body   -->

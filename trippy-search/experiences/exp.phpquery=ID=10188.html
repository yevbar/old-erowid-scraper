I'm not all that clued up on the origins of Guarana, only that it is derived from a South American fruit. Here in Australia you can buy it everywhere in the ephervescent tab form, usually 1000mg each and come in packs of 12-15 for A$8.00.<BR>
<BR>
The first time I sampled some was during a break at University where I found myself very tired from the previous nights study. I realised that I had 5 hours of lectures to go and I needed more than a cup of coffee... So I hopped down to the local pharmacy and looked around for natural, legal uppers. I figured taking large amounts of any legal 'pick-me-up' was bound to do something. I chose the Guarana tabs.<BR>
<BR>
I put four tablets in a 500ml bottle of water and drank it all in about 10 minutes. For about an hour I perhaps felt a little more awake but I may have been fooling myself. Then during the lecture (about 1.5 hours after taking) a rather strange and bizarre effect began to happen. I found humour in everything. I was happy, laughing, cracking jokes (in turn distracting some other members) and just generally not caring about what was going on. But it wasnt a simple case of the giggles - I was really beggining to hyperventilate as if I was being tickled for too long. That 'peak' only lasted about 30 seconds, however, but still I was convinced that the tabs were having more effect than the packet claimed. If you want a really good hit of laughter, then this isn't for you. See nitrous oxide.<BR>
<BR>
Guarana is a cheap, legal pick me up that is perfect for short term depression or just bored for the afternoon. It by no means compares to a 'hard' drug and you'll only notice anything if you take it in large doses. The constant need to urinate however is almost disturbing - and the color of your urine is even more disturbing. Ever taken about 6000mg of vitamin C?<!--   End Body   -->

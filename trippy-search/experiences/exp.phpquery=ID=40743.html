Last night I snuck out of my house after being grounded and went to a party at my friend’s house. No one had any mind altering substances, so I and 2 girls proceeded to call up every person we could to score some herb. I finally got my neighbor to get me some herb, and I and the 2 chicks went out to pick it up. <BR>
<BR>
After we picked it up, we went to one of the girls houses to pick up her pipe. It was at that time that I realized the girl still waiting in the car with me had these two extra pills, and in exchange for a good name with a particular dealer I know, she gave them to me. So I took them with some diet coke. Then the other chick got in the car and we went off back to the party, but before doing so smoking 3 or 4 bowls in the car.<BR>
<BR>
At the party we smoked a shitload more herb, and I must have smoked at least 10 bowls total. Due to this, unfortunately I can’t quite tell you when the pills hit me. But I do know that as soon as the marijuana took hold, an extra oomph was apparent about 20 minutes later. I felt extremely good, I was very giddy (even though I can handle marijuana). After leaving the party I ended up walking around town waiting to get sober, and I felt like there were people with me everywhere I went. I saw people/beings at places where there was absolutely nothing. I told one of my friends to be more hospitable to people that weren't there. I couldn’t walk straight and I was stumbling a lot. However through out this time I was euphoric and felt extremely good. The next day I slept in until 3:30 in the afternoon.<BR>
<BR>
Overall this experience was VERY good, it made plain ol' mary jane seem like Salvia that wouldn’t go away.<!--   End Body   -->

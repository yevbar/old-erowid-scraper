<!--   Start Body   -->


Well, I've been using opiates on a daily basis for about 7 months ever since an injury that left me prescribed to 10mg hydrocodone pills for about 4 or 5 months, and a few prescriptions of tramadol since then. I preferred the hydrocodone, but even though the tramadol didnt have as intense of a buzz it seemed to last longer. Since the prescriptions ended I've been obtaining opiates through other means and have tried morphine and more recently, suboxone.<br>
<br>
When I got these pills, I didn't know much about them other than that they were prescribed to addicts and had made a few friends of mine sick. My morphine request didn't go through, so I got these because they were cheap and figured that they would at least help with the withdrawal. I was tempted to just eat one when I got them, but decided to do some research on the internet first (Glad I did!).<br>
<br>
Being an 8mg pill I decided to cut it up into quarters and melt one under my tongue. Having a relatively high tolerance I didn't expect much and figured I would probably wait an hour or 2 and end up eating some more. I was wrong.<br>
<br>
I took the roughly 2mg chunk at 2:00pm and began to feel it kicking in within the first 20 minutes. By 3:00pm I was in a good mindset and decided I probably wouldnt be needing to take anymore anytime soon. <br>
<br>
As time went on it got better and better. Hydrocodone gives me a really euphoric energetic sort of buzz, but this was more like morphine with a relaxed and weighted down sort of feel (I usually describe hydrocodone as floating and morphine as sinking, this was definately a 'sinker') I was content and in a great mood (there were occasional lapses of a sort of 'agitated' feeling, which is pretty uncommon for me, especially on opiates. But nothing crazy and they passed soon enough) <br>
<br>
I guess I won't go too much into the feelings associated with the drug. Opiates are what they are and theres only so many synonyms for words like happy and content. What I really wanted to highlight is how long these damn things last! So at 5 oclock (hydro would be more than worn off by now) I'm still feeling great and realize how hungry I am. I usually take opiates on a relatively empty stomach to maximize effects and abstain from eating until afterwards. But for the price and how many of these new found wonders I had, I decided some food in my belly would more than warrant what I expected to be a sooner come down.<br>
<br>
Went to a meal with some relatives and my buzz was getting stronger while I was sitting at the table. I was prepared to say goodbye to the new peak as I started eating, but the good ol' opiate buzz kept getting better and better. After dinner I felt like a king, well fed and fucked up (in the good, unsloppy way opiates fuck one up). <br>
<br>
Now it's about 6:30pm and I was thinking that finally the good long buzz had run most of its course. I head over to a friends house and smoke my first cigarette since ingestion of the buprenorphine on the way. Whoa. About halfway through my cigarette I'm feeling a massive heavy buzz that makes me just want to lay back and close my eyes, I put it out and by the time I get over to my buddy's place I feel just as fucked up as ever.<br>
<br>
During the duration of my time at his house that great feeling of calm and relaxation continues to wash over me in waves, gaining momentum and subsiding only to come back over me again. I also experience that 'wave' effect with morphine.<br>
<br>
At around 10:30pm I head back to my place where the intensity of the buzz has definitely subsided but I do continue feeling it until around 2:00am when I go to bed.<br>
I woke up the next morning at 6:00am feeling well rested and all around fantastic. Not really any 'buzz' to speak of but I felt more relaxed and sociable than usual. I go to school for welding  and I laid some of the best beads (sorry, welding term. I won't go into it, but if you've welded or know about welding, you know what I mean) I've ever done. I was 'in the zone' as they say.<br>
<br>
So I guess I give these an A plus as far as opiates are concerned. Like everything, I do gain a tolerance to them after time, but that's to be expected. I really hope I accurately stressed how powerful these are, had I taken the entire 8mgs I would have been sick as a dog. Definitely something you want to start out with small. <br>
<br>
It should also be said that opiates are nothing to mess with in the first place. I won't say they aren't fantastic drugs or try to stop anyone from experimenting. But it's that great feeling that does you in. Substance dependence is real shitty and it only gets shittier.<br>
<br>
Anyways, hope that helps out.<!--   End Body   -->

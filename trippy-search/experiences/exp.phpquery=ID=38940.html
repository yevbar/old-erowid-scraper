<!--   Start Body   -->


To start, I'm a healthy, responsible 25 year old male. I've never had a habitual drug problem. I've only used drugs recreationally and responsibly. To go through my background with psychoactives, I'm experienced with alcohol, marijuana and a handful of psychedelics (Mushrooms, Morning Glories, LSD, HBWR)<br>
<br>
So, I tried cocaine for the first time last night with a very good friend of mine. He's one of my best friends and pretty experienced with the drug, so I felt very comfortable doing it with him.<br>
<br>
Anyway, to start I did a round of about 3 thin lines. After a few minutes I felt very awake, refreshed and buzzed. The first thing I noticed was the stimulating effects: Increased sociability and an alert and clear mind. Immediately I told my friend how I would describe coke as a 'sober high', meaning I felt high but not intoxicated or inebriated…My mind was clear and not foggy (I'm used to more of a 'downer' type high, so stimulants were totally new to me).  The coke felt like a high dose of caffeine, without the unpleasant side effects and with more of a body buzz and euphoria.<br>
<br>
After my third round or so of about 3-4 small lines, I got a really good jacked buzz going. By this time I finally mastered my snorting technique. I got my first good drip of the night. (most people hate the drip, but I actually really liked it) After the drip went down I got a nice rush throughout my body. I remember saying to my friend that my body felt like a balloon. I felt a very pleasant light and floaty body buzz overcome my entire body accompanied by a mild euphoria.<br>
<br>
At one point we smoked a little high quality marijuana (2 joint hits each) and this mixed nicely with the coke. It took the edge off the coke and both the effects of the drugs felt good and worked well together. Marijuana and coke are a nice combination.<br>
<br>
Throughout the span of 8-10 hours or so that I did the cocaine, I never felt any sort of need to do more. I felt no 'crash' or unpleasant effects from coming down. I felt no addictive qualities of the drug. <br>
<br>
All in all my first cocaine experience was enjoyable. It wasn't nearly as intense as I was expecting, but was enjoyable.<!--   End Body   -->

Preparation: one gram of '2-methylamino-3,4-methylenedioxypropiophenone HCl' was visually divided into eight equal size piles of 125mg each and each one placed into a gelcap. One cap was ingested by the researcher at 7:00 PM Friday night, and here is his report....<BR>
<BR>
'Given the structural similarities, I expected the methylone to be much like MDMA, as it is an extremely close structural analog. This is not the case at all. Methylone is most definitely not a recreational party drug. On the contrary, the trip was a deep, therapeutic one which flirted with transcendence. I have in general found the quality of the insights gained on phenethylamines to be somewhat shallow and glossy, and therefore was very surprised by what I got from this material.<BR>
<BR>
The onset was very similar to ecstasy, but calmer; a centered, meditative euphoria. I had taken the drug while with a close friend, who did not take any drugs herself, and for the first hour or so we just sat and talked. It was nice, I felt good, extremely happy, much the way I feel coming up on any psychedelic. We then met up with some other friends, all of whom were sober, and their incessant yapping about basically nothing began to annoy me in a most unpleasant way. This surprised me, as with most phenethylamines I am very social, and very tolerant of others. With the Methylone, I felt the urge to be either alone or having a deep meaningful conversation with one other person, not chatting it up with my stoner buddies.<BR>
<BR>
Realizing that my trip would be wasted were I to remain in that environment, I decided to take a nice long half hour walk to the convenience store. As I walked, I fell into a sort of trance. I was extremely depersonalized, and it was as if I was disconnected from the world around me. Negative thoughts began to flow into my head. At first I blamed it on the material, thinking I was having a bad trip. But this was not the case. The negativity stemmed from the negative choices I have been making in my life recently. It was as if I was looking into my personality and my actions in a most raw and unforgiving way, cataloging the good, the bad, and the ugly within me. <BR>
<BR>
It then came to me. I stopped in the middle of my walk. I must have appeared peculiar, standing in the middle of the sidewalk, staring straight ahead for what seemed like an eternity. I realized that for the longest time, I have blamed my difficulties and lack of success in certain areas of my life on the close-mindedness of others. Sort of like a teenage rebel who sits at home depressed while talking about how he worships Satan and hates the world :-) I have delevoped a defensiveness about me, a bristling reaction of anger to the smallest criticism of my choices or certain character traits. And I realized that I was not perfect. And that there was no need to be afraid of that. For as soon as one can accept that one has issues to work out, one may work them out (if that makes any sense at all.) It is when one blames everyone else for one's difficulties that nothing gets accomplished.<BR>
<BR>
Eventually, I walked back to where my friends were chilling, and sat down on the bed and meditated. Normally I am completely incompetent at meditation, but the methylone had put me in a state of mind where I could sit in the lotus position for as long as I wished and calmly let my energy equalize itself.<BR>
<BR>
The peak of the trip lasted for three hours, from 8:00 to 11:00. The comedown, however, was extremely long. Even at 2 AM that night, 7 hours after ingestion, there was definitely something there, and 5mg Imovane (zopiclone) was taken so that I could sleep. This residual stimulation became somewhat annoying, although not extremely unpleasant by any means. The next morning, I woke up, still definitely buzzing from the Methylone. I was not completely down until 2 PM that day, when the buzzing was replaced with a general tiredness similar to, but less severe than the day after MDMA. Going to the gym and working out later that afternoon restored my energy, and I slept extremely well Saturday night.<BR>
<BR>
I think that a Methylone trip in the right environment and with some mental preparation could be life changing. There is a strong spiritual dimension to the experience which I will explore more fully next time, now that I know what to expect. As for dosage, 125mg was perfect for me (who is somewhat of a lightweight when it comes to phenethylamines) and I would repeat it at the same level.'<BR>
<BR>
As a postscript, I shoult note that contrary to the reports of some, this compound appears to show increased potency when taken intranasally. On Saturday night, a 125mg cap was split between four individuals who had never used Methylone before, and each found 37.5mg snorted to give a fairly mild, but definite trip. However, they did not have nearly as profound experiences as I did when ingesting it orally. Personally, I will stick to oral ingestion.<!--   End Body   -->

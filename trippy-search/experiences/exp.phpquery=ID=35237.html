I belong to a psychedelics club that ideally meets on the last Saturday of every month to try out some sort of novel combination or explore old favorites as a group.  Over the years (at least the last three) we have developed the pleasant habit of doing 5-MeO-DMT pop-ups together at the end of our psychedelic sessions and I want to share my experience because I think that it is something more people might enjoy integrating into their practice.  <br>
   <br>
No accurate dosage has been recorded as it is our scientifically dubious habit to keep a perpetually loaded crackpipe around the house, adding more material now and again whenever it doesn't seem to be hitting very well anymore. When it gets to be that time (typically dawnish) we all gather around someplace soft an cozy for DMTeatime.  It seems to work best when everyone is almost entirely down from whatever it was that took us but we're still feeling slightly expanded and open. Sometimes we roll a joint and lace it with about a matchhead's worth of 5-MeO-DMT, other times we just break out the little glass vaporizer and pass it around.  Each person takes one hit.  Depending on the whim of the moment and the desired effect this can be a ceremonial puff or a big old long lung filling toke, with the general tendency falling somewhere in between. <br>
   <br>
When we do 5-MeO-DMT with intention for realsies we are always silent until the Experient re-emerges, but this method does not produce the full-fledged experience and we often continue to joke and chat in a mellow and low key way while all of this is going on.  Occasionally the person who has just passed the pipe will lean back for a minute or two in a warm fog of psychedelic rapture, but for the most part we remain aware of our surroundings and are able to see and hear, cuddle, sip tea and  participate in what passes for witty banter at five in the morning on drugs.  The 5-MeO-DMT seems somehow to wrap up our individual and collective trips for the night, summing them up in a gestalt or a series of gestalts. It also ties all of our club meetings together, as 5-MeO-DMT space is somewhat atemporal at least for me, and I can feel myself and my friends every time that we have done 5-MeO-DMT together in the past and -tantalizing but hard to grasp at- when we will do it again in the future.  It also serves to synergize group energy, especially when we manage to pass the pipe fast enough that we're all experiencing some part of the rush at the same time. I encourage anyone who is interested in group telepathy research to look into this effect.<br>
  <br>
We have tried this so far with mushrooms, MDMA, LSD, ayahauscha, mescaline, 5-MeO-DiPT, 2C-I, AMT and a few other more obscure drugs and combinations of drugs.  Be cautious if you might still be tripping harder than you think, as this can bring whatever you're on right back up if it's not really settled all the way down. (mostly a feature, occasionally a bug)  I love to combine 5-MeO-DMT with MDMA because the ecstasy gets rid of the background anxiety that is always present when I contemplate another visit to he Great and Only - however it should be remembered that E can make 5-MeO-DMT stronger and longer as well as more telepathic.  This is true even at the pop-up level.  Try a tiny taster puff and see where it gets you, then work your way up to more.  After about half an hour it sort of stops working which is probably for the best.  I myself am a total Mystery whore and I would keep on going right back there as long as there was something in the pipe if it were otherwise.  <br>
<br>
The Last Saturdays Club is a fine institution and one that we would like to see spread.  There is a comforting sense of solidarity in the idea that there are other little groups out there exploring the Mystery and I believe that the collective un-sub-super conscious/resonance field/noosphere is brightened up for everybody when a bunch of smart cool people are tripping at the same time and we can all pull a little bit more bandwidth when we work together.  I hereby declare the last Saturday of every month International Let's All Take Some Psychedelics And Try To Figure This Thing Out Day. Start up your own chapter right away and we'll meet you in Hyperspace!  <br>
<br>
P.S. I have seen the same thing done with NN DMT.  Some kids in the back of the Teahouse at the [gathering name deleted] were doing up what they called 'deemsters' at the end of a trip. I was coming down from mushrooms and E and I intentionally underdosed so I can't really speak for it. Apparently it's a thing amongst [deleted] gutterpunks.  Some said that it's a good way to ease into NN if you're afraid to try it at full strength.  I agree, but I would start with tasters when I was sober if I'd never been there before. <br>

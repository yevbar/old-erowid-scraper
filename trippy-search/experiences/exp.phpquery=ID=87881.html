<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: 'Bath salts' and similar products generally do not list ingredients or dosage on their packaging. Analysis has revealed that ingredients in a single product of this type may vary over time.] </FONT> <br>
<br>
I was first given a small dose of this powdered substance [MDPV] a few weeks ago and found it very pleasant, and so I decided that when I got paid next that = would purchase some for myself to expirement with.<br>
<br>
I drove over to the local porn shop that carried the substance as a 'condensed bath salt' and I, being the fool that I am, was do0ped into buying two 500mg containers instead of one to save $10. I was very excited.<br>
<br>
I randomly snorted a line in the car before I started my drive home. I felt very good within 5 minutes and even better in the 15 it took me to get home. <FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</FONT>  It was very much a 'heady' high. Pressure in the eyes and such. Slight euphoria. I continued doing lines/bumps when I started feeling a come down. Now I must tell you all that I did this without researching the chemical or knowing proper doseage >.<! The night moved on from there.><br>
<br>
After about 2-3 hours of indulging in what I thought at first was an amazing thing I decided to take a drive. The lights in the street were very bright and there were sunbursts from every source of light. My eyes became enraged and I quickly went home. I knew then that I shouldn't do more but did anyhow. I spent the whole night up peaking out of windows.<br>
<br>
The next day I had off of work and the MDVP just kept coming. Come morning I was still awake, very paranoid, and I believe I was seeing and hearing things. My apartment didn't feel like my apartment any longer. In fact it felt like I was in an entirely different world only backwards or 'bizarro' like on Seinfeld. Gratz if you get the reference :p ... anyhow throughout the day I swear to you I could hear my neighbors having sex next door. I truly believe this was happening. Two car loads of guys were going in and out and this carried on for hours and into the night. I remember texting my girlfriend explaining that the people next door were having an orgy and I felt like calling the police so I didn't have to listen.<br>
<br>
When I sent the text I heard very loud sex noises outside my window and so I took a peek. There were lights on in the back yard of the neighbors behind and I saw a man walking towards a shed in towards some shadows (kinda looked like a cop.) The noises continued and I heard some hollering. By this time I had moved my bedding into the living room to avoid the noises. Soon after the noises stopped. All of the cars that were there left except one. I decided it was ok to return to my room. As soon as I lay down I heard a shower kick on and sex through the walls! This was short lived and then the last car left. Hallucinations? Who knows.<br>
<br>
I also witnessed my coffee table float up about 6 inches. I felt like a jedi. I wasn't sure if it was really moving so I held my foot still and it still moved up. When I looked at its legs they were still on the ground... weird.<br>
<br>
All of this was followed by extreme bad mood... severe depression... eye inflammation which caused 'flashing blue lights' look it up... and extreme red eye among other things.<br>
<br>
All together around 500-550mg in a 2 night binge not a good idea.<br>
<br>
Proceed with great warning and respect everything you try by being educated first. Psychosis is not fun!<!--   End Body   -->

<br>
It was last summer. I just broke up with my girlfriend of 11 months and I was pissed. I had just left some camp grounds after bitching at her and I went to my friend S's house and another friend J was there. J told me he wanted me to try superskittles (DXM) and that’s what I went there to do. When I arrived I lit up a cigarette and was getting really excited, then he told me he couldn't get the DXM. Instead he pulled out a bottle of equate motion sickness (Dramamine). He said I should take 8 and I’ll trip hardcore. That night I took 10, and that's when it all started.<br>
<br>
A couple of months later (still last summer) I had gotten hooked on this shit. Dramamine was what I did literally every night. I found out how easy of a tolerance it is to build up on this shit. One night I had a rough time at work and I for some reason didn't do Dramamine the night before (weird at the time). I had taken like 20 a couple of nights before and didn't feel a thing. Either that or I fell asleep before anything started, but usually I’ll wake up itching and shit, but I didn't that night. So I thought I wanna trip balls, so I pulled the bottle out from in between my mattress and box spring, opened it up and poured out a whole bunch. I divided them up into groups of ten. I had three groups of ten and after those I only had five left. I thought I could do 16 twice, but I didn't really trip last time and I wanted enough left over for another trip. Fuck it! Instead I took all 35! Crazy shit and I advise no one to do this!<br>
<br>
Even though I had a pretty high tolerance for this shit, I had no clue what I had just done. This night was the craziest night of my life! After about 20 minutes (this shit kicks in fast for me) I was feeling it. Just a mild high, mostly noticed when I would walk around or just move. A very heavy feeling and my depth perception was way off! I had put a timer on my tv to turn it off in 2 hours I thought, but I only set it for one hour. By this time I was totally fucked. Hallucinations everywhere. I saw shadows, things that weren't there, shit like that. My tv turned off and my room was pitch black. I had forgotten where I was when the tv turned off and I couldn't see shit. I got off what I thought was my bed walked around for probably 15 minutes before I finally found my door. Now my room isn't small my any means, but it isn't huge either. It’s about a 12 by 14 foot room. <br>
<br>
Anyway, when I opened up my door, I walked out into our recreational room upstairs (like a living room) and saw loads of my friends. 'Wow!' I thought. 'Did I throw a party?!' My friend S who I brought up in the beginning of this report was sitting on my steps. I went over and sat down next to him and talked for a little while. I really had to piss so I told him I’d be right back. <br>
<br>
I walked past my sister’s room. She came out and asked me who I was talking to. I told her Steve and pointed by the stairs. She said Steve who? I looked and he was gone. So was everybody else! I went into the bathroom and for some reason tried to fit my head through my shower doors. There was maybe an inch of space, but I thought it would fit. All of a sudden I SLAMMED my head in to the shower doors and just stopped everything and stared. My sister came into the bathroom cuz I had never shut the door and asked what the hell I was doing. I told her I was taking a piss and I kicked her out and closed the door. I finally got done pissing after a long-ass time and went back out in my rec. room. <br>
<br>
Everybody that was there before was there again plus more people. People I didn't even know were there. I talked to quite a few people. I even started weight lifting with one of my friends at fucking 1 in the morning (I knew the time cuz I looked at the clock). My sister went downstairs cuz I was scaring the shit out of her and she got my grandma. I live with my grandparents by the way. My grams came upstairs and caught me just as I was goin back into my room. I was standing right in front of my door leaning on our entertainment center and all of a sudden I moved out of the way and said 'Go ahead!' my grams looked at me like I was crazy, which is when I figured out what I had just done. I realized I thought there was a line of people behind me and I knew I was going to be standing there talking for awhile so I was going to let them go past me. <br>
<br>
My grams told me to go downstairs to the family room and she woke up my gramps. She told him what had been going on. then she proceeded to tell me earlier that night I went into the kitchen, pulled out a bunch of pots and pans, put them on the stove, turned on all the burners, filled up a cup of water and was about to pour the water all over the top of the stove. She stopped me and took me back to my room she said. I have absolutely no recollection of any of that! I don't remember shit! Anyway, while I was sitting on the couch (both parents staring at me and asking me what I was on) I started to dig around in the couch. I got off and looked under the couch and pulled the cushions out and everything. My grandma yelled my name and got my attention. She asked me what I was doing and I told her I was looking for my keys because I was about to leave, and that's why I thought I was downstairs. <br>
<br>
They kept threatening to take me to the hospital over and over, so I gave in. I just told them to take me. Fuck it! I was sick of listening to them. I think that was the craziest thing I did all night! On the way there I kept leaning foreword to the front seat of our van and talked to my sister. My grandparents told me to sit back because she wasn't there. I sat back and saw her in the back seat and kept talking to her. They asked me who I was talking to and I told them 'Ashley' (my sister). I don't remember much after that. I remember sitting in a hospital bed and they put an IV in my left hand. Damn that shit fucking hurt. My grams later told me I almost broke her hand because I was squeezing it so hard. My gramps told me I almost broke his hand too. <br>
<br>
Anyway, the next thing I remember is sitting in a hospital bed in another room on the other side of the hospital, and there were two beds in my room divided by a huge curtain that you can open and close. As I was laying there, I kept seeing little kids run to my side of the curtain and get the toys that they threw onto my side and then speed off to the other side of the curtain. Unfortunately my grandparents were standing right there and asked me what I was doing because my body had a huge jerk and I told them it was because I can't fall asleep I think. <br>
<br>
My parents left and went on home while the doctors checked up on me every 2 hours to check my blood pressure and my heart beat and other stuff. One time I woke up in the hospital bed and there was a priest sitting on a chair next to my bed. I looked at him and said 'No way'. I was still fucked up and I thought I thought 'no way' to myself in my head but it turned out the priest heard me and started talking.<br>
<br>
Well that's about all of what happened. It was such a fucking crazy ass experience! Of course, however, I still do Dramamine once in awhile, but I’ll never probably go past 20 pills.<!--   End Body   -->

One week and one day later, I can write about this.<br>
There is SO much to convey, to report, I won't be able to share it all.<br>
Layers upon layers upon layers of experiences, that continue to this moment<br>
in calm and profound ways. I did the right thing.<br>
<br>
I began preparations a week before, cutting out meats, focusing on things<br>
I wanted to change in my life, intentionally introspective and self aware<br>
to the best of my ability. All this time, I had the feeling that Iboga was<br>
aware of me. I'll say this once, then just let it go: I'm reporting some<br>
things that won't jibe with consensus reality. Nevertheless, they are real.<br>
Think what you will.<br>
<br>
The day before I was going to take the Ibogaine, I ate only vegetables, and had<br>
my last cigarette in the evening. I'd been sober off alcohol for about,<br>
well, 4 weeks? I spent time in the jacuzzi,<br>
relaxing and focusing, praying and meditating. I invited Iboga in<br>
intentionally during a meditation. Interestingly, I felt acceptance, and my<br>
visualization was intense. Felt like it wasn't self generated at all, and<br>
included splitting me open at the middle (solar plexus? xyphoid process to<br>
pubis?). I sealed and sent my intention with the energy generated by<br>
orgasm, then with some trepidation, went to bed.<br>
<br>
The next morning at 9am, I took a test dose of TA extract. I tolerated<br>
this well and took a flood dose carefuly calculated for my height, weight,<br>
gender and length of sobriety. This did not take me where I needed to go,<br>
and so over time, in 300-400mg increments, I made it up to over 3 grams of<br>
extract. Apparently I was a hard nut to crack. Two other people I have<br>
spoken with used the same product and found it very potent, so that wasn't<br>
the issue. (Wish I had boosters, though!!! Damn!).<br>
<br>
At around 3?4? in the afternoon, I looked in the mirror across from the<br>
bed and saw some people peeking around the corner of it-from the inside- to<br>
check if I was ready. I called for a giant mouthful of plain yogurt, I was<br>
craving it like mad, lay down, and went on a journey. :)<br>
<br>
I threw up only twice, shortly after that, quickly and painlessly. I<br>
suffered no prolonged nausea and no dry heaves.<br>
<br>
My BP was strong the entire time, not much fluctuation from my normal<br>
100/70. My pulse stayed at an average 56 beats. I was so incredibly<br>
relaxed. Of course there were visuals. So many visuals I could not possibly<br>
tell you all of them, as time was very different as well. I can tell you it<br>
began with an eye, that saw me. A sense of myself having waited, maybe as<br>
if in a queue, and I was finally seen, addressed. It was my turn.<br>
<br>
I was matter of factly and sometimes with humor shown many, many things<br>
about Beverly, and about the world. Much of my thinking was realigned, and<br>
many old wounds were cleaned out. I also know very strongly that I will<br>
take this journey again, that Iboga has more for me, and I for Iboga,<br>
though I realize how presumptuous that sounds. I did indeed communicate<br>
with my dead elders, remember that was one of my early questions? I also<br>
think that my 20 some odd year history with meditation and visualization<br>
and traditional magics were a boon, as was having been fairly sober except<br>
for marijuana and a couple days of recreational darvocet for some weeks.<br>
I also did Not want to be disturbed during the experience, and maybe came<br>
across as bitchy in conveying that (sorry, dear husband!lol). I cried a few<br>
times during, but it seemed that as soon as the emotion made it to my<br>
mouth, I was onto healing the next thing.<br>
<br>
I came around the next morning full of light. Or maybe just so clean<br>
inside that my light was visible. If I didn't have a witness, it would be<br>
almost hard to believe that my skin actually glowed. Light from within, I<br>
was luminous. I was enamored of my hands, so pretty and soft, though I<br>
didn't look in a mirror for three days. I didn't think of it.<br>
<br>
I again went to the jacuzzi. I was able to sit lotus without a thought in<br>
my head, not a thought! for ten minutes. This is actually amazing, lol. I<br>
was and am so calm. I did not want a cigarette, a drink, nothing. I was<br>
free of all wants, really. A perfectly lovely place to be.<br>
<br>
My ovarian cysts have shrunk to the point of being no longer palpable.<br>
This is down from 9cm and visible when I lay on my back. I no longer need<br>
surgery for the moment.  My surgery was scheduled for 9/14. :)<br>
<br>
I then dined on a brilliant plate of fruits. In little teeny tiny bites,<br>
lol. Everything tasted divine. Interestingly, for most of my life I have<br>
disliked fruit. Now, I've been to three farmer's markets in one week<br>
because I can't get enough. I proceeded that same day to read 'The Easy Way<br>
to Quit Smoking' (thanks to the wonderful human here who brought that to my<br>
attention) and finished it. I've wanted a cigarette a couple times since,<br>
but mostly out of boredom and when it's a habit (afetr eating, etc) nothing<br>
I can't acknowledge away. :) I am not finding alcohol to be an issue any<br>
longer. I'm not even thinking about it.<br>
<br>
I made roast chicken and braised squash on the next night, with a simple<br>
risotto. I needed a splash of wine for the risotto. The rest of the bottle<br>
is still sitting in my house. It is a non-issue.<br>
<br>
I also must say that emotions bubbled up after, and still are, but not in<br>
the same way. For the first few days they came like puke or diarrhea. Not<br>
that it was gross, but definitely was a purge, and there was NO stopping<br>
it!!! Lol, walking down the street, getting sad about not seeing my beloved<br>
grandmother one last time before she passed. Looking desperately for an<br>
alley or hidey hole, because, man, I'm going to sob! After each cry,<br>
though, I just felt bigger inside. Wider, more expansive. I now fully<br>
inhabit my skin.<br>
<br>
I can breathe into my feet, my breathe moves in me.<br>
<br>
Also, in the past I have been buffeted by other people's emotions, I pick<br>
up on them like a sponge, often to my detriment and confusion. This is<br>
amazingly under control now. I am less porous, less...vulnerable? Yeah, but<br>
less porous seems more accurate. I have not lost the ability to connect,<br>
but it's a choice, and I can see whose emotions are whose. This is such an<br>
unexpected gift, but just one of many.<br>
<br>
I also look much younger, according to husband and dear friends. My face<br>
feels so relaxed. There is less pain on it, to be sure.<br>
<br>
I also am confirmed in needing to escape this darned day job! (In time, in<br>
time)<br>
<br>
There is so much more, but this is a decent brief.<br>
<br>
I see many things clearly now, and am confirmed in my thinking on many<br>
others.<br>
<br>
I know I will be working with Iboga in some capacity, I have no idea how,<br>
but I am confident about it. I did the right thing.<br>
<br>
My very heartfelt thanks to Iboga, the place it grew, the hands that<br>
harvested, the entities that got it from there to me, my husband for<br>
sitting with me and everyone who has contributed to the movement.<br>
<br>
Particular thanks to the individuals who have taken the time to talk with<br>
me privately, and opened their hearts to me, giving me the gifts of their<br>
time and attention.<br>
<br>
It is my hope to be able to give back at least as much as I have been<br>
given.<br>
<br>
I am a different woman, or maybe just more profoundly and completely the<br>
woman I've always been. ;)<br>
<br>
Love and rockets,<br>

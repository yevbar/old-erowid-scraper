I write this, about 20 minutes after a terrible end,...<br>
<br>
I got the Kratom on advice from the seller at the local SmartShop.<br>
<br>
I asked for a relaxing tea, I had bought and tried Passionflower tea about 6 weeks earlier, but I just added hot water rather then boiling it, so it was just a very relaxing, but nasty tasting tea.<br>
<br>
He said he didn't have anything really tea like, only brew things.<br>
<br>
But, he said, he had something he uses himself when he needs a nice calm.<br>
<br>
He showed me a 10 gram pack of Kratom, explaining that he takes 5 gram mixed with yoghurt in the evening.<br>
<br>
I already read about Kratom, and knew it had nauseating side-effects, so I asked whether there were any bad or strange side effects, besides the calming down.<br>
<br>
Where he replied there were none.<br>
<br>
I trusted him, thinking 5 grams of a 10 gram, which should be the full dose, is a light dose and probably just relaxing, like the Passion Tea.<br>
<br>
I got time to try it with yoghurt that friday evening.<br>
<br>
But it totally failed, it tasted so bad I couldn't get in more then 3 small spoons of it.<br>
<br>
The next week, now that is.<br>
<br>
I decided to try it with some juice, as described on the website of the store, and other places.<br>
<br>
T+0:00<br>
I had put the remaining 5 grams in a large glass and filled it up with chocolate milk, at first the powder floated on top.<br>
<br>
But after stirring a lot and waiting, it settled through the chocolate milk and became drinkable.<br>
<br>
It had a bit of a bad taste but not super awful.<br>
<br>
<br>
T+0:10<br>
When I had finished drinking it up, I looked through some music and made a relaxing playlist to chill on.<br>
<br>
T+0:30<br>
I lay down in bed, my hands were cold from working behind my computer, so I warmed them up.<br>
<br>
After my hands were warm, I relaxed, closed my eyes and felt sleepy, I was relaxed and tired, even without the Kratom.<br>
<br>
All that comes now could as well 've been placebo,... very likely actually.<br>
<br>
T+0:45<br>
With my eyes closed, I was very able to visualize lots and lots of imaginative things, pictures, moving to the music.<br>
<br>
I usually do this anyways, but it went extra good, seen I was very relaxed.<br>
<br>
T+1:00<br>
It got boring after a while, opened my eyes, looked at my video arcade cabinet and decided I wanted the music from there, as well as the winamp visuals displaying in the screen.<br>
<br>
I got out of bed, a bit wobbly in my legs, probably placebo, I had this with Passion Flower tea too, but not with mushrooms.<br>
<br>
Started opening the cabinet and working on it.<br>
<br>
T+2:00<br>
As I was messing with getting stuff installed, I felt a nausea coming up.<br>
<br>
I sat down and I started moving my leg neurotically, it made the nauseous feel go away, but it didn't make me feel any better.<br>
<br>
My mood wasn't really relaxed, my hands were shaking and I knew it was going kind of wrong.<br>
<br>
Was just a matter of waiting till it went away, then go to bed or write this experience thing.<br>
<br>
T+2:30<br>
I was chatting with a friend in canada on msn, told him about the kratom and that I felt like shit.<br>
<br>
I paused my typing and I knew I was gonna throw up, I looked around my room, to decide where to leave my stomach fillings.<br>
<br>
The floor was the best place, my garbage bin was full, and I had linoleum, or well, easily cleanable floor covering, so no real problem.<br>
<br>
I bended forward from my chair and waited till I actually had to puke, avoiding unnecessary moaning sounds.<br>
<br>
After 3 throws I was done, I didn't feel nauseous anymore.<br>
<br>
Cleaned up, and talked to the guy on msn again.<br>
<br>
Floor is still smelly.<br>
<br>
God this sucked, I didn't get any relaxier then the badly prepared Passion Flower tea, it tasted far worse, and I had to throw up.<br>
<br>
Not for a retry!<br>
<br>
It could've been miscellaneous things that contributed to the nausea, but it's mainly the kratom.<br>
<br>
Because I barely throw up,... even if I'm VERY sick, nauseous, dizzy from a boat ride, or bustour that's taking ages, I just have a nasty feeling in my belly, and sit that out for as long as it takes.<!--   End Body   -->

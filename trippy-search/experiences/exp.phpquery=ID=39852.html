<br>
The following are experiences of a friend and I from three years ago... one of which being his last.<br>
<br>
Three years ago, after failing a few drug tests for my probation officer, I quit smoking marijuana, which left me craving something. My friend of 15 years had an answer: Salvia. I expected a mild effect, and was terribly wrong. In the past I had been known to eat between 3 and 5 rolls (ectasy) and 5-10 hits of LSD at once, so I figured this would be nothing. 'K', we'll call him, warned me as I held the blown glass pipe packed with a half of a bowl in my hand,'Don't hit hard like weed.' <br>
<br>
I shrugged his suggestion off and nailed it. Upon exhaling, I instantly went from sober to what I would say was just as or more intense than the journey (ies) mentioned above. I had never been jolted into a peak that fast, so I was caught off guard. For a split second I was very scared. Then, I cannot explain the next few moments accurately, but I know I couldn't move. I'll even go as far as to say I couldn't think. When my level of comprehension finally went from that of a rock to an inbred dog, all I could do was laugh. During the laughter, I still felt very self-conscious and uncomfortable with my surroundings. Finally, when I began to partially function, I realized that everyone else in the room had smoked some, too and they had also begun to move and speak. (Or at least mumble and try to). K said he felt like he was on TV, so he didn't want to say or do anything in fear of everyone watching the show laughing at him. The after effects, in my opinion, were very unpleasant. I never got that 'sudden understanding' I receive when I come down from LSD. Basically, the thought of hitting the pipe again made me feel uneasy, however, I felt as if I created a void that I needed to fill.<br>
<br>
*K's last experience*<br>
Although I was not there (even though I wish I was), I can tell you about how his usage of it changed him very quickly.<br>
<br>
He had (as well as I) also been attracted to alternate realities, but over that last month of his life he had become even more reclusive than previous. He had a 50 gal fish tank in his room which contained 2 oscars that he trained to do tricks. (<- you'll see how this is relavent in a sec). During the last few days of Oct and first few days of Nov 2001, I only saw him a few times, and most of these he complain about someone stealing his salvia (liquid form). He seemed somewhat unable to handle simple life tasks without irritability, too. My other friends and were getting kind of worried, and rightfully.><br>
<br>
On Nov 5 I asked him to go to a concert and even offered to buy him the ticket. He declined the offered. I had an uneasy feeling that entire night like I knew something bad was going to happen. The next morning I had just gotten to work when I received a phone call from mom telling me that K was dead.<br>
<br>
At about 6am his mom found him lying next to his computer (like he had fallin out of the chair). She tried giving him CPR, but it was far too late. In his pocket was darvocet (which he had for his wisdom teeth surgery) and a baggy full of sweettarts. He had put the liquid form of salvia on the sweettarts and was eating them all night. The autopsy showed a lower than fatal amount of darvocet and what they called 'an unknown substance'.<br>
<br>
It turns out his parents found the vial of the liquid salvia and took it from him. He was 20 yrs old so I guess, even though they were worried, thats why they didn't ask him about it. <br>
<br>
Remember the fish, which he used to prior to salvia brag about? He had lost interest in everything else so bad that when his brother came back from college for the funeral, he found the fish floating and the tank so dirty that he couldn't see through an inch of the water.<!--   End Body   -->

I took Angels' Trumpet two times.  I was living in Central Florida, where pretty many people have them growing in their yards.  The first time was back in 2000.  I actually was at school (I was 15 at the time), at a Saturday school for getting in trouble.  I had just moved to the area a few months earlier, and someone I had met but didn't know well and went by the nickname of Enoch had a cup of coffee with him before we had to go in to do our time, lol.  He handed me some and after I had taken a few sips told me there were Angels' Trumpets in it.  As I was from a northern state originally I had never heard of this tropical plant.  I thought he was playing a joke on me, so I drank more to make sure there was no strange taste and to prove I didn't believe him.<br>
<br>
We went into the school and I remember the first effects I realized was I was doing some homework and the words on the page started spinning around and after that I don't remember much.  Only little bits and pieces.  There was a police officer there, as is the way they always have it during such activities.  I was told I patted him on the head like a dog when he took me outside to talk with me, I remember I couldn't speak, which I have found out now is probably from the side effect of dehydration, my throat was probably restricted or something.  My grandmother had to come get me and she took me mistakenly to her work first, which was a medical center.  They told her she had to take me to the hospital immediately.<br>
<br>
I remember once I was at the hospital they tried putting a catheter in and an IV and I flipped out and they had to put me in four points to get the IV in.  I remember smoking cigarettes that kept vanishing.  I remember talking to someone, I don't remember who it was, for a long time and they too vanished.  The first time wasn't really all that great at all, it was just confusing and I really disliked it as I wasn't ready for it.  Though I don't think you ever can be as they say, you really don't believe you're hallucinating.  You really believe it's all real.  I was no stranger to drugs, I had done my share of acid, shrooms, heroin, weed, coke, etc.  Nothing got me ready for the Angels' Trumpet.  The hospital had said I was very lucky to not die as my heart was beating so fast, and I guess they said I was allergic to it...I don't believe that now that I've read everything I've read.  They just don't know much about it even at the hospital.  I believe the guy who gave it to me had done it smart, like on the one post, how you should build up your tolerance as he said afterward that he did it all the time and he never went to the hospital.  <br>
<br>
The second time was very different.  We were already rolling on ecstasy when me, my bf at the time and our other friend decided to go and find an Angel Trumpet bush.  We didnt' make it into a tea at all, we just ate the leaves, putting rolls in them and chewing and swallowing real quick (to this day I hate salad!)  The first thing I noticed that time was all the plants starting to take a purple color and get all furry.  I knew I was in for it...That night has haunted me for the past 6 years.  Even though I have a husband and two daughters I'm still freaked out by it.  I don't know why it effected me so badly, but it was more than just a trip I feel like.<br>
<br>
I really think I left my body, I was flying above the world.  We went out to a shroom field (a cow field, where we usually picked our shrooms.)   We had all laid down in the middle of the road and looked up at the sky, I was flying and I remember also looking out into the field and seeing two young blonde haired girls waving at me to come back.  I think I was out of my body because I was dying.  And the funny thing is, that years later I had my daughters who look just like the two girls.  I have dissociated before on just ecstasy, alot of it, and I really believe that when that happens I'm leaving my body because I'm almost dead. <br>
<br>
I don't remember all that much from that time period, but as dawn approached one of the people that lived near the field called the police as they saw us wandering around so oddly.  I was naked, which still bothers me to know to this day.  The police came and the ambulance, they kept just saying we were incoherent.  My bf at the time was okay enough to walk home, yet me and the other friend had to be taken to the hospital.  When I was in the hospital, I did the whole smoking nonexistant cigarettes thing again.  I had also been bitten all over by fire ants, they literally feel like fire!  And ever since that night any time I get bit by one I feel very strange almost like a flashback type thing.<br>
<br>
But anyway, so the cops probably felt bad for me that time as they didn't charge us with anything.  I think I forgot to tell you I got charged with 'injestion of harmful chemicals' the first time I took them.  That was bullshit.  Anyway, I don't know why it effected me so greatly.  I really believe it's called angel's trumpet because an Angel is trumpeting for my death.  I know I've read now that many people can take them and be fine, and I'm happy for them because it's the trip of a lifetime, if you live.  I sometimes still wonder what it would be like if I could do it and not suffer in the hospital and getting poked w/needles and all.<br>
<br>
If I could do it with a sitter, as people recommend, and if I still even did drugs and didn't have a family, I would consider it.  There's something so spiritual, yet in a way so evil, about the entire experience.  I'll let you know...the way I always looked at it was like a Garden of Eden type situation.  What was odd was the people I was with that night were named Adam and Lucas (i.e. Adam, Eve, and Lucifer and the forbidden fruit of knowledge of good and evil!).  But I think if you're willing to open your eyes to some very strange things to knowledge that we may not want to have as I really don't believe I will ever be the same, than go for it and partake of these plants.<br>
<br>
One of my psychiatrists told me one time that when you do Angels' Trumpet the poison actually blacks out a part of your brain, like kills it.  I don't know how true that is, and I know I've done so many other drugs that could have effected my brain as well.  But I still have dreams of that twilight time during which I was tripping out in the field.  I always wake up with such a strange feeling.  I really like the way other people worded it on the one site, how it is like a dream you're awake in, how it's a mixture of your conscious and unconscious coming together unlike any other type of hallucinogen can do.  I really don't believe it is something the younger generation should just mess with as some way to get high.  It has more meaning than that.  I was stupid too.  There are some things that are above us...more than us.  I don't believe it's the plant necessarily, but what it can invoke within us.  Thanks for letting me share my story.  Hope it is of some help. <br>
<br>
I also find it very intriguing how it seems to be an ongoing phenomena with the Brugmansia and Datura that everyone has tons of imaginary people around them.  I don't know if that shows the need in us as a species to be social, especially during a time when our bodies are fighting off a poison that could possibly kill us!?  I remember quite well people in the hospital being there, then disappearing...and people that weren't really there I'd have conversations with for so long.  The cigarette phenomena is pretty interesting too...everyone seems to have the same experience of smoking imaginary cigarettes the whole time.  It's so very frustrating when you keep dropping and not being able to find or pick up these hallucinations too!  Maybe it symbolizes that what we're looking for in these trips isn't attainable through this way of trying to get to ourselves.  The only way to truly understand yourself and the world and experience it for all it's worth I believe is through true experience, daily life and introspection of yourself...not the lies of drugs and other forbidden fruit!<br>
<br>
As others have written in...I don't recommend this drug to anyone.  Whatever it is you're trying to find you can find without it within yourself and this world.  Don't die trying to find life.<!--   End Body   -->

<br>
well<br>
<br>
I am a small pixie of a girl. at the grand age of 21 I have experimented with different hallucinogenics, such as mushies, and lsd, and pills of many kinds etc. So now a good friend of mine offers me some bromo dragonfly for my weekends festivities... 'warning... takes up to 3 hours to fully kick in... they are very well made.' So a good friend of mine and I went to a mystical festival out in the countryside, couldnt think of a better place to trip.<br>
<br>
approx times:<br>
4pm<br>
we take the tabs, one each, whilst sitting on a giant hammock. they taste pretty strong. We drank a beer. we then wonder about for awhile a wondering what will happen later<br>
<br>
5pmish<br>
we head back to the van to smoke and eat before eating becomes a challenge... it was about half an hour into eating a never ending cup of mung beans that I realised the van was beginning to shift, that the walls appeared to be breathing ever so slightly. That beer was not such a good idea as I could now feel a headache spreading from the back of my head. At this point I do believe we have a spliff.<br>
<br>
6pmish<br>
trip is deffinately kicking in as the sun goes visuals get a little stronger. We head to the woodland to bang on some drums. I remember my amazment as I hit the old water drums and blongs, the vibrations were visible all over the place, like each time I hit it I could feel it, it could feel me. It reverberated outwards and I could see the sound waves. I couldn’t speak very much already at this point, I was just like woooow man… at pretty much everything I looked at. He on the other hand was able to chat away to various folk we bumped into, experience perhaps. We walked over to the stream, people were camping on an island. I think it was at this point that I started to peak. <br>
<br>
7pmish<br>
yep peaking <br>
everything looks utterly beautiful. This truly is a very pleasant hallucinogen as things are just wonderful, I feel great, I'm full of positive energy, there is no fear, no negativity.  The landscape looks totally lush, the water ripples by, a small bird catches the attention of my eye and I watch it for a time, whilst my friend chats away to some people about something or other. The land seems to ripple and sway with the water, ooh I cant quite focus right now! <br>
<br>
We wonder backwards<br>
Things get a little sketchy from here on, as the light began to disappear the visuals grew more intense. The fields were very muddy, and the weather not too good. But this did not make me cold as it normally would in such situations. <br>
<br>
I think we went back to the van for awhile to float about, this was when I think I first noticed the moon, it looked so amazing I think I nearly fell over as someone caught me. I stared and stared, wondering how far I could push it, and yes, little by little I saw a very faint face emerge, formed of the cresent moon to the right and venus to the left, the tree line skimming the bottom of the chin. As the stars came out the music got better, in reality it actually got better too! We stayed for a bit where the music was groovy. The trees too were getting interesting, pines, now I always thought that pines kind of vibrated, but this was something different!<br>
<br>
So we walked about the festival wowing at things.  It seemed different from acid or mushies in that I felt a little distant from everything, like we were not quite there… this has to be one of the down points of this drug. And I felt so calm that words seemed to not be worth saying, that I couldn’t justify what I was thinking and seeing.<br>
<br>
Ah yes seeing. <br>
Perhaps it could be the name, but we both agreed that we were seeing the dragonfly. The visuals seemed bluey, greeny with a touch of pink and shimmery, they seemed to be  similar to insect wings, and the slight audio desortion complemented this. The most beautiful had to be the stars. The stars were already beautiful where we were, a really clear night, with very little light pollution. But with the dragonfly it was completely ammmaaaaaaaaazing! Words cannot fully describe the true beauty of that night sky. We lay down on the huge hammock and gazed up at the stars we could see for miles into the cosmos. the patterns of the constellations were so very clear, and there just seemed to be way more stars. There were patterns within patterns of triangular and pentagons shapes… (this may have been influenced by my thinking at the time, as I have been looking at the golden section) <br>
<br>
Hmmm… <br>
At some point in the night we also saw a fire show, which again was beautiful, and very sexy too, in fact, yeah, I remember getting more and more horny! And these situations I always find tricky, because once I am in that frame of mind whilst tripping everything seems to be some kind of innuendo! And therefore seems more complicated!<br>
<br>
I should now mention that this friend was more than a friend! However, we didn’t know each other so well, and nothing came of these feeling of lustfulness L … there will always be a next time!<br>
<br>
Oh yeah. We played with glowsticks. Which was a lot of fun. They looked so cool. If I span one up in the air above my head it looked as though I could control the cosmos with my very finger.<br>
<br>
Fire was also very nice<br>
And woodland<br>
Mud not so much<br>
<br>
We smoked a few spliffs here and there, not that it made any difference.<br>
<br>
Sleeping now, that was the worst bit. And physically impossible. And I wished I took a valli too! But I didn’t and so spent most of the night annoying my other half and walking about. In fact I remember something not so good, as he was falling asleep I got really sad, I felt like I was being left behind some place. All very silly. <br>
<br>
So I shut my eyes and spoke to various things, and I learnt something, someone spoke to me and she was blue and beautiful, something I hadn’t realised for a long while, “don’t be anyone else,” “don’t run away anymore, you don’t need to run away… its all here”<br>
<br>
I loved the dragonfly and she loved me. But I wont be doing it again in a hurry.<br>
I have 2 tabs left. And I shall save them for a sunny day sometime in the future.<br>
<br>
So yes. It lasted a total of about 24hrs, although I am not sure as after this sort of time we smoked some wonderful hash and other things and I fell into a deep sleep all the way home… in the way of the gear stick.<br>
<br>
And my good friend, well he thought they were ok in bits but called it drag-on fly!<!--   End Body   -->

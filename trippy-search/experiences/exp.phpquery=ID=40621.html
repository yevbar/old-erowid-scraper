<BR>
Something like this might have happened to some sentient clams on another planet a few millenia ago.  Perhaps even oysters.  If it did, I can assure you that the names have been changed to protect the ignorant.<BR>
<BR>
Genesis<BR>
<BR>
I'd had no sleep the previous night or that day until a two hour nap shortly before the experience.  After waking up from my nap and showering, I took my twice-daily dose of Deprenyl (Jumex), whose neuroprotective benefits I am known to extoll.<BR>
    <BR>
I've never tripped with more than about eight people before, so this was a new experience for me.  Twenty-five of my friends gathered in our den and shared what we'd been going through recently.  I ducked out when the sage was lit (gives me awful headaches), and spent the next two hours just hanging out with people.  About two hours after embarking our Shaman made his rounds offering a booster dose of 10mg for those who wanted it.  I wasn't getting any visuals yet, so I figured why not. I lay on the couch in our living room and spent an hour dipping in and out of several conversations and luxuriating in what were undoubtedly the most beautiful and transfixing visuals I've ever seen. When the discussion turned too silly for my taste I decided to  relax alone for a little while.  I went upstairs to my room and lay down on my bed.<BR>
<BR>
I then proceeded to fall directly out of reality.<BR>
    <BR>
I was told afterward that at this point I climbed up on my bed and started hanging from the rafters, and subsequently attempted to jump through my window (second story of a loft, overlooking the living room).  Fortunately only the inner pane shattered.<BR>
<BR>
Context<BR>
<BR>
Like falling asleep, I don't remember the point at which I left this world, but I do remember what I saw.  My dream took place in the context of a wireframe cube; periodically the cube would rotate in some randomly chosen direction, and I would slide along the edge to remain on top of it.  The cube was a stage upon which the following story unfolded.<BR>
   <BR>
A few of the cube's edges were cartoons of qualitative extremes. There was the 'clean' edge of the cube being polished by rotating cloth-brushes like you see in an automatic car wash.  There was the 'late' edge covered with watches and beeping alarm clocks, the 'meticulous' edge covered with detailed embroidery and etchings.<BR>
   <BR>
Predecessors<BR>
<BR>
There were a few recurring themes to my experience: water, daylight, hope, and time.  But by far the dominant motif was that of 'my Predecessors'.  I suppose others might say 'ancestors', but I don't really identify at all with my genetic line so much as my<BR>
memetic lineage.  It was more about those who voluntarily chose a path similar to mine before I had found it.<BR>
<BR>
Cycle<BR>
<BR>
I went through the following cyclical thought pattern probably four or five times during the night.  The pattern was the same, but the experience which I was reacting to ('this') was different each time. I don't remember the specific experiences in great detail, probably because it was the cycle which was more important for me to see. Each cycle began with a gradual degredation from trippy bliss into a state of bewildered confusion.  I would feel that I'd been thrown into a completely incomprehensible situation where I couldn't do much but sit back and watch things happen to me.  I would become stressed by the fact that I didn't know how to respond to my surroundings.  But then I would ask myself 'why should I be stressed about this?' and I would cease to care.  This brought short-lived relief; I quickly remembered that danger and harm (and hence fear) were the reason why inaction isn't always the best response.<BR>
<BR>
At that point I would remember my Predecessors; that others had done this before.  I realized that they had created a safety net for me so that I could experience 'this' without reprecussions -- a trial run.  This reassured me, eventually making me very happy. Somehow I became convinced that it was daytime outside, and that I could simply stand up and see the daylight through the skylight. I'm told I leapt up to my feet several times and had to be restrained; I'm sure that was the physical manifestation of this experience.<BR>
<BR>
I then realized that one of my Predecessors had been [benevolently] manipulating my experience to show me important things.  He would then reveal himself to me and smile, after which I took his place and he transcended in a moment of ecstatic enlightenment.  This moment took place in the midst of a beautiful connundrum tied to my recollection of the drug I had taken: the 2C-B was both the sacrament taken in celebration of transcendance as well as the catalyst which had triggered it.  The snake swallowed its tail and I would drift off into a state of semiconscious bliss in an ocean of beautiful colors.<BR>
<BR>
Epilogue<BR>
<BR>
Towards the end of my trip I felt more relaxed.  I was briefly back in a hostel in Cuzco, looking at the mountain city's freakishly blue sky.  Later I was led around the various staff departments of my University; I was shown filing cabinets in the<BR>
library, wiring closets, the steam plant, and so on.  By about T+9 hours the trip had more or less ended, and I slept fitfully for about 12 hours.<BR>
<BR>
I'd do it again in a heartbeat if I knew I could expect an experience like the one I had.  But, of course, that's far from certain.<BR>
<BR>
Regardless, I might try it again.<!--   End Body   -->

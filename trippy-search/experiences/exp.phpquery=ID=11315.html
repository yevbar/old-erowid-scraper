<!--   Start Body   -->


I consider myself fairly experienced with drugs.  I am a daily marijuana smoker, and I have considerable experience with alcohol, tobacco, magic mushrooms, MDMA, and DXM.  I was given 2 pills which I was told were pure MDMA...which was not the case at all.  After reading reports at Pill Reports, and talking to others, I have found that these pills were mostly 5-MeO-DiPT, with either a trace amount of MDA or MDMA.  Unfortunately I was not aware of the presence of 5-MeO-DiPT at the time of ingestion.  Before I go into detail of my experience, I would like to STRONGLY recommend everyone does their research before popping pills.  A test kit is cheap and easy, and websites such as Pill Reports (www.pillreports.com) have lots of good information.  Now, the experience:<BR>
<BR>
7:30pm - I ingested the first pill and felt a slight coming up after about 30-45 minutes.<BR>
<BR>
8:30pm - I was feeling a good body high, colors and sound seemed enhanced, and my emotions seemed to be at a heightened state.  The effects seemed similar to a low dose of MDMA.<BR>
<BR>
10:00pm - Still feeling good, I listened to some trance music and fired up the visualizations on Winamp.  Definitely the best part of the night...I felt as if I was 'at one' with the music.  I had a strong overwhelming sense that trance music was made for those on ecstasy.  Although I was rolling, I decided to enhance my experience by taking the other pill at this point.  This was my mistake.<BR>
<BR>
12:00am - Between 10 and 12 I still felt a good 'rolling' feeling.  At approximately 12 I was overcome by a desire to move around.  I was moving in warp speed: my speech, walking pace, and thought process were all extremely accelerated.  I decided to go on a walk by myself, which in retrospect was VERY foolish if I had passed out, but I was on my cell phone with a friend throughout the duration of it.  My muscles were all very tense, and I felt sick to my stomach.  I was also EXTREMELY hot and I could not stop drinking water.  My pupils were extremely dilated, and everything around me seemed ‘surreal’ I felt as if I was in some strange void, and this is when the panic started to set in.<BR>
<BR>
12:45am - I was in my own personal hell inside of my mind.  The only thing which existed inside of me was fear.  I had convinced myself at this point in time that I was going to die, and I thought about my funeral and how my family would feel after I was gone for a very long time.  Talking to others helped, but I spent most of this time walking around outside at a very fast pace.<BR>
<BR>
3:00am - Between 12 and 3 everything was the same -- I was consumed by fear, but now I was thinking that I would pull through, and I could tell that I was beginning to come down.  I returned to my room, but I was no where near sleeping.  I talked to friends online, and this helped keep my mind distracted from the fear which was still there, but not as prevalent.<BR>
<BR>
5:00am - I was still feeling the effects rather strongly.  The fear seemed to come in waves now, but it was more present than absent.  At this point I decided to drink some alcohol to lower my inhibitions, so on an empty stomach I quickly downed between 3 and 4 shots (this made me feel very sick).  I then proceeded to take a warm shower, which in combination with the alcohol seemed to help immensely.<BR>
<BR>
8:30am - Between 5 and 8:30 I was wide awake, but not feeling the effects as strongly anymore.  I watched TV in my bed; eyes wide open for the entire time, until I was finally able to fall asleep at 8:30am.  I awoke at 1:30 feeling horrible.  I felt hung-over (possibly from the hard alcohol on an empty stomach?), and the come-down from the 5-MeO-DiPT seems to be fairly harsh.  It is almost 24 hours since I took the first pill, and I still feel pretty bad.  Earlier in the day I had a slight twitch, and I have had the shivers on occasion throughout the day.<BR>
<BR>
This is a STRONG chemical that I knew little about before getting into it.  It can be EXTREMELY intense.  In retrospect, it was one wild trip that I hope to never have to experience again!  <!--  I submitted a report about my incident at approximately 5am, but it is most likely incoherent and an irrelevant source of information as I was still tripping strong.  -->

<BR>
<BR>
I'm glad I drank the alchohol, and I believe it would have helped me earlier, but I did not want to induce any side-effects mostly related to dehydration and the presence of MDMA in my system.  If you find yourself freaking out on DiPT, just hang in there -- it's a long ride but it will end eventually!<!--   End Body   -->

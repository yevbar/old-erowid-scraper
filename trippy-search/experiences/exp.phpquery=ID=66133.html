This is an honest detailed report of my date with that hot piece of ass Datura.<br>
<br>
After looking all over the net for locations of Datura in my town and finding nothing, I turned to Ebay and found exactly what I was looking for. It was really cheap too! Today is the day after my 'trip' and I am slowly recovering from Datura's grasp. I tried to keep a detailed log of my experience, but towards the end of the log it becomes quite unreadable. <br>
<br>
5:00pm - I Have made the tea mixed with Lipton's tea and am going to gulp it down as fast as possible. Note: It tastes just like Lipton tea but my gag reflexes are trying to prevent ingestion. I find this a little odd considering I like Lipton's tea. I feel a little anxious and scared at the same time.<br>
<br>
6:00pm - Physical intoxication (not like alcohol, more like taking 10 hydrocodones at once) accompanied by heavy limbs and a slight blur of vision. My face feels like its heavy and I am noticing that I have to make a better effort to speak so people can hear me clearly. I am starting to feel the need to smoke cigarrettes more often than usual. I'm not exibiting any signs of cotton mouth or disorientation. Decided to watch a movie. <br>
<br>
8:00pm -   Mildly disoriented . Forgot to post an entry for 7pm because I became so ingrossed in wandering the house and smoking every 15 minutes. At this point, I can barely read what I am entering here in the log. I feel euphoric and my limbs grow heavier by the hour. I constantly feel as though I have something in my hands which are empty. <br>
<br>
8:43pm - No halucinations yet I feel like I'm being watched. Aditory hallucinations have started and are creeping me the fuck out! I am hearing babies crying and other sounds that I can't make out. feeling really disappointed that I'm not visually hallucinating.<br>
<br>
8:57pm - Can't pee anymore. I'm seeing flashes of light outside in the dark and the voices have gotten louder. I'm also starting to see lots of bugs but they dissapear when I reach for them. I went to roll a cigarrette then left the paper in the can and decided to have a pre-rolled cigarrette. The next morning I would find that the paper I was going to use for the rolled cigarette was a figment of my imagination.<br>
<br>
9:30pm - I am feeling weird tremor-like sensations all over my body. I feel kind of sick to my stomach, but not enough to even classify it as a stomach ache. Going to go have a cigarrette. Waves of confusion wash over me about every five minutes. Feeling lonely and bored as fuck.<br>
<br>
This is where the log becomes litterally unreadable. There is a significant time gap between my last recorded cigarrette and the time the clock said when I decided to goto sleep. After my last smoke I came in and the clock read 4:00am which makes me worry about what I was doing in that time gap considering I went out for that cigarrette at 9:30pm. I don't remember anything until 4:00am that morning when I found myself getting ready for bed. I thought I saw some Datura seeds on the floor so I decided to pick them up but it turned out to be so hard I gave up. Note: Never once did I see my cigarette vanish or disintegrate in my hands, nor did my speech become completely inaudiable.<br>
<br>
I tried my hardest to fall asleep but I had a very hard time getting comfortable. Each time I was about to sleep my sister who never really did this kept coming into my room and asking me questions. I would answer with a what due to my fan being so loud it was hard to make out word for word what she was saying. I would also wake to find millions of ants crawling all over my body and I would just brush them away and continue to try to sleep. I forgot that I was in my own room and believed that I took my fan into the living room and slept out there. <br>
<br>
When I actually got up for the day I felt fine but my eyes were still dialated and anything moving in front of me had tracers. I am starting to have memories of what happened in the time gap but only glimpses that don't make sense.<br>
<br>
I didn't enjoy Datura as much as I thought. I was disappointed because I felt trapped in my own world, my everyday life. There were no science fiction themed hallucinations, no crazy off the wall happenings, It was just me alone and bored.<br>
Not even the voices could change that feeling, nor could the Datura-fabricated conversations I had with my sister. I can't envision myself ingesting Datura again, but it would be interesting to me on a scientific level to watch others ingest and observe them from a sober point of view.<!--   End Body   -->

My cousin and I decided to trip for the first time the night before a Phish concert. We assumed we would find more drugs, when we'd get there. He and I WERE good friends prior to the trip...<BR>
<BR>
He and I had picked up an eigth of shrooms. We had been told by the person who sold us the shrooms, that you shouldn't take a person who flips out to the hospital unless they are comatose or violent, because the hospital can't speed the drugs out of your system. You must wait it out.<BR>
<BR>
We began the evening with a good start. We didn't drive and we didn't get into any hostile situations, until he 'came down early'. I was fucking nuts and had been all evening. It hadn't been a problem, but I was acting very oddly. I didn't know who my parents were. I was making no sense. I lost touch with the greater part of reality. No real visual halucinations ('cept tracers), just raw confusion. However, my cousin was the one to panic. He was afraid I was O.D.ing or I was permanently nuts, and he drove me to the hospital.<BR>
<BR>
I was chewing on a Road Atlas in the back of his car, when one of the hospital staff adressed me with the question: 'What did you take?' I replied in terms that made perfect 'sense' to me, '17 hits of acid in 17 days,' and I repeated myself until I had felt I had made myself completey clear. Things pretty much went downhill from there, and as you can probbaly guess, I missed the Phish concert.<BR>
<BR>
My cousin kindly informed the hospital that I was overdosing on shrooms. They led me to the Emergency Room where they tried make me lie down on a table; they were planning to pump my stomach, unbeknownst to me. I resisted. They insisted. A struggle involving swearing, biting, much thrashing 'bout, and a good half dozen people including doctors, security guards, and nurses who forced me down on the table. <BR>
<BR>
They injected me with something, which I am guessing is Thorazine, which stopped almost all of my muscle movements. I couldn't blink, or breath. I was on a lung machine to keep me breathing. All I could do for nine hours was piss and weep. I WAS CONSCIOUS THE ENTIRE TIME! [Stilling tripping balls, too.] I experienced getting my stomach pumped, which may I add, is quite painful and disorienting. I could not force myself into sleep, and any attempt escape the reality before me failed. Only darkness and pain existed.<BR>
<BR>
It took me a few hours to realize that I was actually in a hospital, because I could only hear what was going on around me and see when my mother or a nurse wiped the tears from my eyes. I freaked out periodically, because I strained to move my limbs (or anything at all), which were totally unresponsive. At one point I came to the frightening conclusion, that I had broken my spine in some horrible accident and would have to suffer the rest of my life trapped within a black hell. <BR>
<BR>
Eventually (the end of the 9 hour ordeal) I could twitch my arms, which they strapped down, and I fell asleep and woke up in a hospital room. The first questions I asked were, 'Did anything come up from the pump?' 'No.' 'Do I have brain damage?' 'No.' 'Did the mushrooms I took paralyze me?' 'No.' It was off hospital record. I spent 3 days there for an irregular heart beat they noticed while they were monitoring me. The bill totalled $6000, fortunately somehow covered by my 'rents insurence. I was grounded for two weeks! : ] But, forever, there is a gap between my parents and I. My cousin never said he was sorry.<BR>
<BR>
I tripped again, under more supervised circumstances (with experienced trippers and steady rolling friends) to prove to myself that I would have been fine without the hospital's help. I went nuts again, but all went well, I merely learned I have a great susceptability to shrooms, and I have experimented with many other hallucinogens (LSD, anti-histamines (Benadryll/Dramamine), DXM, Estacy, and Morning Glory seeeds.) since then, and had a damn fine time, too. I still trip off shrooms; I have learned to survive the confusion that ensues, plus it is cheaper because I require less. I also learned very strong coping skills. Oh, well. What doesn't kill you only makes you stranger...<BR>
<BR>
Er, I mean stronger.<!--   End Body   -->

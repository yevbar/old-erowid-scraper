THE EFFECTS:<br>
I begin to ramble and talking is very exciting...  Everything I say is a punchline to a joke that everyone should get but they don't.  And if I take it with someone else... we both laugh a lot because I think the other person knows exactly what I am thinking.... I find myself narrating everything in my head and saying outloud 'DID I SAY THAT?? OR JUST THINK IT?'  Visuals get strong and I might see auras around people...  I'll find myself questioning everything I ever thought.<br>
<br>
THE EXPERIENCES:<br>
It's been more than a year since I have touched 2c-p...  I've done it twice, the first time I thought I was in love with it... everything felt heartbreakingly real, It was like living a vivid dream, and I felt very close to the friend I was with.<br>
<br>
The second time I took 2c-p was a nightmare.<br>
<br>
We took it around 9 o clock pm. Me and my friends B and J had just left a very boring birthday party and decided to take some and go to B's dorm, hang out and enjoy the visuals.  My friend B had never taken it before, had just started smoking weed... she was mostly against drugs.  My friend J and I had done it before...<br>
<br>
So we get tired of the dorm... B gets paranoid and kicks us out for 'talking too loud'  (we were whispering)  At first time went slowly.  and then hours went by and I found myself outside in the city, lost with my friend J.  Now all I can remember is a slide show of night people, cops, and me completely vulnerable.  Around 5 am my friend B lets us back in her dorm room briefly and kicks us out again. me and my friend J ended up trying to walk home... getting in a horrible fight in a grave yard unable to make it home.<br>
<br>
When I take too much 2c-p their personality becomes intensified.  I wanted to stay inside the dorm... where I felt safe, I didn't want to deal with anyone but my friends. My friend B wanted us to be completely quite... which is impossible when I am on 2c-p.  My friend J wanted to be out in the nightlife..  I wanted to die and kept telling people that I had just met.<!--   End Body   -->

I know that there are many people out there who believe that it is not possible to get physically addicted to GHB; that people are only psychologically addicted... In my personal experience this is NOT the case...<BR>
<BR>
I had begun using GHB on a regular basis back in february of 1999... At first it was great, it opened me up socially, lifted my mood in a way that felt very natural, and anytime I wasn't feeling 100%, a gram and a half of G would change that... I started using it about 5-6 times a day, constantly keeping my G nearby in some Orange Juice... I soon found that it was also an excellent remedy for any insomnia I might have, and that 3.5-4 grams at night before bed would ensure a good night's rest...<BR>
<BR>
After a month or so I began feeling very anxious and depressed yet I didn't even consider that the GHB which helped lift my spirits could also cause just the opposite... This effect snowballed after a while, but I was always able to keep it in check by topping even more doses of GHB... Eventually 6 months passed and I was becoming severely depressed which was accompanied by overwhelming anxiety... I had escalated my usage to about 10-15 grams of GHB during the day, plus another 10-15 grams just to put me to sleep... This number doesnt take into account weekend usage, this is what I was using to make it to school and back and just survive the day...<BR>
<BR>
I eventually put two and two together and decided that I would have to stop taking GHB.. this was about nine months since I had first begun using it regularly... I had no idea what I was in for by deciding to quit, put I couldnt take it any longer... I was learning what the term rock-bottom really meant... The GHB was no longer having any good effects but kept me at a constantly moderately depressed state.... I stopped taking the GHB cold turkey... I poured the gallons I had down the drain and took it from there...<BR>
<BR>
The withdrawal first manifested itself in the form of overwhelming anxiety and depression(nothing too new at this point) which kept me locked in my room for about a week except for eating and using the bathroom, and the occasional exam which I couldnt miss... I couldnt think clearly and forming a full sentence was damn near impossible, not that it really mattered in that state... next came bouts of nausea accompanied by a malaise similar to the flu... On top of everything else I then started getting tremors and reallyy bad shakes...  Since I had no nightcap I remained wide awake for 3 solid days... I felt like I was going insane literally, I was hearing voices at night and at that point was wishing that I was dead...<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, after about 3 days I managed to sleep for about 2 hours which increased by half an hour or so every subsequent night... After about 7-10 days I was able to start going to class again as the tremors and shakes had subsided to a manageable level and I was pretty much able to think clearly again... The depression, which i never had at any point in my life up until the GHB would come in terrible waves for the next 3 months until I started taking paxil which has helped dramatically... 7 months later I am still taking paxil and my life feels pretty much normal again, although I still have very bad insomnia, something which I never had to any real degree up until the GHB.... <BR>
<BR>
I have written this to warn anybody who doesnt believe there are any negative side-effects to habitual GHB use... The symptoms were very intense and very real, nothing I had any control over... I don't hate GHB, and I still think that for other people recreational use on a periodic basis is fine... Some of this may seem dramatized or sensational, but I am not exaggerating any of this.  The symptoms I have described are very real and nothing other than my own experiences...<!--   End Body   -->

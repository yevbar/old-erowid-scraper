At the time of this powerful journey I found myself living in Hollywood, just two blocks up from the infamous Sunset strip, and right in the middle of all the action. It was a Friday night and I had decided to stay in, my two roomates out and about town.  I was on no medication at the time and in good health, as well as good spirits.  Living in Hollywood drugs were plentiful and easy to get, so a week or so prior to the night I am about to describe I found a source from which I bought 5 pills of MDMA from, and some friends knew them to be good.<br>
<br>
I felt like having fun that night, and 'tripping' in some way also.  Confident I would be alone for most of the night, some good MDMA known as 'marshmellows' was decided upon as the sacrement of the evening.  After many times with X I have found that solitary trips could be as or even more fullfiling then group or public experiences.  As always some herb would be part of the journey, (I feel it is an essentail part of the trip for me), and later when I remembered I had a few Nitrous cartridges.  All was set in my mind.  I would have a little party by myself then I thought, let the good times roll.<br>
  <br>
Initially I planned on taking just two of the pills I had, both at the same time.  I basically look like a football player, and I used to play, so I almost always needed at least two pills to feel the opening MDMA provides.  With the plan in mind and about 1/2 gram of weed in me already, I swallowed the two pills with a glass of water and put in a Thievery Corporation CD.  Excellent New York style Dub/Modern Lounge music.  All I wanted was a nice headspace and good body buzz, and barely 30 minutes later things were beginning to pick up.<br>
<br>
My head emptied of all thoughts as the minutes ticked by, a cloud of white light started to fill my mind, it was beautiful.  I felt so great on these pills that I did not want the feeling to end, as is typical with MDMA, and since I had not done some in over a month, I felt the need to take the other three pills only 2 hours into my trip.  Normally this is not a good idea, to take 5 pills of good dope in an evening, but honestly the push was not stong with these pieces of heaven and I am a big guy, so down the other 3 pills went with another glass of water. A bowl of herb to celebrate life and feeling totally connected with my fellow humans was thus smoked. <br>
<br>
Less then 20 minutes later, a roomate arrives back at the apartment.  'So what are you up to tonight?' he asked.  'Feeling lovely I said', with a quick laugh I tried to stifle.  'I see, ohhh, you eyes look like saucers dude!'  And so they did :)  'How many did you take?' he asked.  'Five' was the reply I gave, barely able to speak at the moment.  I could see his face darken and his brow furrow right away, I knew he was worried about something but I could not figure what.  'That is a lot of pills to take bro, how fast did you take them?'  'Around two hours apart my brother, its all good'.  He was a little bit worried about me taking so many pills in a relativily short amount of time, but he knew me well, and felt I could handle it.  'Fine then, have a good time and keep your cell handy if you need me', he said as he got a few things together and walked out the door a few minutes later.<br>
<br>
Quickly things were escalating to a place I had never been before, a place different all together then what I have previously imagined MDMA could take me.  Slight visions, patterns really, were forming on all surfaces I looked at.  It was a comfortable place, but a slightly strange one too.  Sometime around an hour and a half after taking the three pills I remembered I had the Nitrous.  Right away I got them and put three full ones into my professional cooks whipped cream charger.  Now before this I had taken Nos on X, but just with one cylinder, and that was something to remember, and be wary of.  <br>
<br>
I took a couple of deep breaths and steadied my mind, confident that this blast of gas would take me beyond a place what I could imagine, and it did.  I inhaled slowly, taking as much gas as I could and holding it in until I could no more.  As soon as I exhaled I hit the bottle again, filling my lungs and senses with that sweet gas.  And suddenly something happened which I did not expect.  I let the bottle drop to the floor and breathed fresh air heavily as my chin lay against my chest.  <br>
<br>
Slowly I was able to raise my head to a normal level and that was when it all hit me.  My body was literally feeling electric and a strong buzzing sensation was felt from the tips of my toes to the top of my head.  Everything was quiet, I could not hear the CD I was playing nor the traffic noise from the strip.  It was the quietiest and clearest my head has ever been.  As my physical self accepted the greatest pleasure I have ever know.  Almost a good as a orgasm with a true lover.  My mind was present in the now, enjoying the buzz emensely, but letting me know that I was not finished rising above the clouds quite yet.<br>
<br>
I got this feeling in my head, like I was the creator of the world.  I could provide life or death with a simple wave of my hand, though I only felt like giving life.  A golden hue surrouned my line of vision, I felt very warm but not uncomfortably so, rather like the warmth from your Mother as she hugged you as a young child.  The gold filled my entire spirit, and right at that moment, I believed I felt what a true God would feel like.  Eternally loving, non judgemental, and possesing of all the knowledge I could ever hope to know.<br>
<br>
I truly felt like a golden god, blessed to be a part of fine chemistry at its best.  This feeling might have lasted for 2 minutes at most, but it felt like hours.  I was not afraid, but rather supremely happy that I was chosen to feel those emotions at that time.  I celebrated with the rest of my weed as I was coming down some 5 hours later, and that felt lovely too.  <br>
<br>
I am not a religious man, but if there are gods that exist, let their gaze shine brightly on the man who invented MDMA, and those that use it to its fullest potential.  Be happy my friends, and be safe.<br>
<br>
Peace.<!--   End Body   -->

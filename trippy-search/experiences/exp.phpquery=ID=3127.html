One day i decided to order some salvia from a website when i read a blurb about Calea zacatechichi.  One ounce was only $15 so i went ahead and ordered it.  I didn't try it for a few weeks after i got it because i was playing with the salvia (pretty fucked up stuff).  <BR>
<BR>
Anyway, one day i made some tea with the Calea, only using a fat pinch of leaves and sprouts.  This stuff is so much more bitter than you could imagine, it's almost a trip to drink it!  After a few minutes i felt a little relaxed, a very very subtle weed high feeling.  <BR>
<BR>
It was getting late so i decided to sleep, unaware of calea's dream enhancement.  All i can say is damn!  My dreams were so incredibly tripped out and realistic.  They were very symbolic in a way, i remember every part of the long dream.  At points i remember slightly waking up but still in dream-mode, and from there on i knew i was dreaming and could actually control my dreams.  It was amazing, i would just start thinking about flying and there i was floating in the clouds.  <BR>
<BR>
The only bad part about calea was that the next day I felt really dazed.  I went to school and i couldn't freaking concentrate on anything and it felt like anything anyone would say went in one ear and out the other.  If i wasn't at school it wouldn't matter.  Calea zacatechichi is very cool, the dreams are so incredibly meaningful it's not even funny.  I'm going to go make some tea right now, i feel like dreaming up a storm tonight.<!--   End Body   -->

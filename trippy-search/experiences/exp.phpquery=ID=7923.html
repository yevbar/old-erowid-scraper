I'll start off by saying a few things about nutmeg.  I have realized that nutmeg is a very, very powerful drug that demands a great deal of respect.  Before trying it I urge anyone who is reading this to read all the other posts about this substance.  Read all the info and don't ignore warnings.  These are some of the things I realized are good for me when using nutmeg, and suggestions for others:<BR>
<BR>
1) I do not eat it too late (eg. 10 pm).<BR>
2) I don't get frustrated when I don't feel anything after 3 hours...it takes a while so I don't eat more.<BR>
3) I don't do it if I plan on going to a huge party or rave where I will most likely not drink lots of water.<BR>
4) I drink lots of water.<BR>
5) On your first time, I recommend trying a small dose...if it doesn't work, slowly move up.<BR>
6) I make sure I am comfortable and in a relaxed mindset.<BR>
7) I MUST plan out about 30 hours of time to finally be back to baseline...the next day I will not be doing anything in the way of exercize (or at least I won't want to).<BR>
8) You might read a lot about how people have horrible hangovers from this stuff.  That's why I urge you to drink plenty of water (nutmeg gives me incredibly red eyes and a cottonmouth from hell).<BR>
9) I don't just think I am like everyone else (if I want to do it with a friend, I don't just give him the same amount I eat...he must find out what is right for him by gradually upping the amount).<BR>
10) This is a drug... I don't think that because it is just nutmeg it isn't powerful.<BR>
<BR>
Now, I'll get on with my story.  I've been eating nutmeg for the past 2 months or so now and I have had some wonderful experiences on it.  I started off slowly (2 slightly heaping teaspoons) and didn't feel a thing.  Then I moved up to 2.5 heaping teaspoons and felt a pretty strong buzz.  Then tried 3 and that is where my dose felt comfortable.  Each time I drank plenty of water and was relaxed.  Once I got a feel for it, I decided it is a GREAT drug.  It takes me about 6 hours exactly to start noticing the effects.  Therefore, I always eat it between 12pm and 3pm, usually no later or earlier.  This is because I want it to hit right when I'm done doing things.<BR>
<BR>
Well, one night my girlfriend and I were going to go camping and she wanted to try this with me.  Since she had never taken nutmeg before she opted to stay at a lower dose than me to get a feel for it, and she ate about 2 or 2.5 teaspoons of the substance.  I ate the usual three, then we left for a 3 hour drive to our destination.  The nutmeg was consumed at 3:30 in the afternoon.  We ended up hiking 2 hours to the mountains, by this beautiful mountain river with strong rumbling waterfalls and rapids.  We were about 150 feet from the water at this awesome private camping spot with a large boulder about 10 feet tall right by our tent, that was slanted perfectly to make a chair with the ground as the seat.  We went to go swimming to clean ourselves off, then came back and set up the tent.  It was 8:30 at that point.  I felt one initial wave of the nutmeg just starting.  Funny how it hits in waves of ever increasing intensity and frequency, until it is a constant high.  I will feel something and then it's gone.  Then it happens again and again until it's just constant.<BR>
<BR>
Well anyway, we made a nice fire and got situated to watch the flames.  Then it got crazy.  I didn't think my girlfriend was going to feel much from the small dose, but she started telling me how she was feeling stoned.  I was definitely on my way up at this point and I agreed wholeheartedly.  After the next hour had passed we were both being pounded by the intensity of the nutmeg.<BR>
<BR>
Some strange experiences followed.  While watching the fire we couldn't really have conversations because when on nutmeg, I have no short term memory and the talks we had usually ended up in babbling nonsense and not being able to remember what we were talking about.  Picture a VERY heavy weed high with added benefits, such as auditory hallucinations and some visual ones.<BR>
<BR>
I noticed that while I sat there, I had a song running constantly in my head.  I figured out that I could switch songs just by thinking the name of a song, and I switched to 'Lord of the Rings' by Blind Guardian.  Then all of a sudden, I thought I heard the song in the woods.  I listened and sure enough, I heard 'Lord of the Rings' being played up in the treetops above me a distance away.  I didn't have to think the song...it just played and I could hear it in my ears.  Freaky.<BR>
<BR>
Then even weirder is how my gf and I had been zoning for what felt like an eternity and I talked to her and asked her what she was doing, and she snapped out of this trance and told me she had been listening to a song in the woods to her right.  It was Garbage, 'The World is Not Enough.'  She said it had been an angelic voice singing it to her from the woods.  This at the same time I was listening to music in the woods, too.<BR>
<BR>
Then I looked to the fire and saw something crazy.  The sparks coming up from the flames were trailing little tails out behind them that appeared to be orange snakes traveling towards the sky.  I watched this for 5 minutes or so and told my gf about it...she had also been watching the same thing at the same time.  Strange.  There were a few more instances like these seemingly shared hallucinations.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, I'll wrap it up here by saying that while on the nutmeg...everything, and I mean everything, ruled.  We brought fresh picked strawberries and grapes with us and lots of water and had pretty much the best night of our lives there in the forest.  I try to be careful when using nutmeg.  It is quite powerful.<BR>
<BR>
This story helps to demonstrate that doseage can vary from person to person.  All in all, I recommend nutmeg to anyone interested in it, but I urge you to carefully plan it out and experiment with it to figure out your dose.  Keep it natural.  I've learned that nutmeg can be an incredible drug if used properly; I'm tired of seeing all the bad rap it gets from people who I don't think use it with respect.<!--   End Body   -->

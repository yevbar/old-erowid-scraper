It all started on a Saturday night and me and my friends were supposed to be going into the city for a night of clubbing. I myself am not the greatest dancer in the world so I figured the night would be a lot better if I were able to get something to trip on. I had been trying to get acid for the past several days but amazingly enough the usual source had dried up. Then about 4 hours before I left I remembered that my friend Hobbes had gotten this powder which he used and said was killer. I called him up and he was more than happy to give it all to me. In total I had a capsule with powder in it and a little vial with some more.<BR>
<BR>
At about 8 o'clock I had dinner. Two pieces of sub sandwhich, both with lots of oil and mayo and shit on them. Bad idea. About nine o'clock I took my pill and left to go to my friends house. We were sitting at my friends house for about an hour and nothing was happening. I remember my friend Hobbes told me this stuff would take a few hours to set in, and when he had used it he snorted some of it. So we finally left my friends house and I'm still feeling fine. <BR>
<BR>
As we are traveling down the Palisades Parkway I decide it's time to snort some of this stuff. I do about three 1 1/2 inch lines and then I look up. Oh shit. All of a sudden everything in the sky is having trails with all sorts of colors. The stars, the other cars, airplanes, the George Washington Bridge, just everything starts trailing. Suddenly I get this terrible feeling in my stomach and my friend pulls over. I get out and vomit a lot on the side of the parkway. Then I get back in and we go to a gas station where I procede to puke everywhere. Finally I'm ready to go so we get back in the car and go to the city. <BR>
<BR>
The ride through the city is intense as hell. I remember everything is being rushed and going really fast, like that part of the Bush video Machinehead (no, I don't like Bush) where everything is going super fast. Finally we get to the parking garage and I can't get out of the car. Once again I start puking all over the place while these Indian guys working there are trying to get me a bucket. I remember continually saying to my friends 'Ohhh, I get it. This must be really boring for you guys.' Everything I saw was like surreal with all sorts of colors that were almost vibrating off everyone's skin. I finally managed to get up and we began to walk to the club. I was so shit faced I had to hold my friends hand as we walked and all I did was stare up at the stars and all the buildings in awe and wonder. It was like I was in this other world so far away from everyone. I felt like I understood the world and what it was all about. For the first time in my life I felt like I really understood what friendship was about and that's all I kept telling my friends. I have tried to really remember exactly what my thoughts were but no matter how hard I try I can't remember. All I know was I felt like I truly understood the world and that I knew why people used these sorts of drugs. <BR>
<BR>
Well, we never made it into the club because there was absolutely no way I was getting in there and two of my friends had some sort of other problem. So we go back to the car and I'm still seeing all sorts of shit. As we are driving I keep saying to my friends 'It's normal for you guys but for me it's like riding the train'. I also kept saying 'Those damn hippie kids, get you everytime man, everytime.' For the first half of the drive home I kept seeing different backgrounds and themes that I really thought I was living in. Like my friends car turned into a disco with flashing strobe lights and shit and then it turned into this like alien blacklight poster one of ym friends had. Then things get reeeeeally freaky. I'm in the back of the car by myself but all I see is everyone in the car (we had two cars) and I'm talking to these people in the car that weren't even there. Then I look over to the right and I swear there was a fuckin police helicoptor following us with the spotlight and everything. I begin to totally flip out and tried jumping out of the car several times at 60mph. One of my friends had to jump in the back and hold me down and then put the childlock on the door. I was seriously flipping out. I could also see our car in a television set on the news with that 'Live' in the corner and us running from the cops. It was intense. <BR>
<BR>
That was one of the last things I really remember. By about 3AM me and my friend are sitting in a parking lot and a cop shows up. I shove my head out the window and start cursing off this cop really loud (something I would never do). Luckily my friend just told him I was drunk and he was taking me home. We finally got back to my friends house at 4:30 and the visuals were pretty gone but I just felt so fried all I could do was stare at the tv. When I closed my eyes it felt like everything was getting progressivly darker and I really thought I was going to do if I fell asleep so I didn't sleep all night. <BR>
<BR>
Overall this was possibly the most whacked things I have ever done in my life. I am pretty sure I ODed on this stuff and I did quit using any drugs for a few weeks after this experience. The visuals were so intense, but also everything that went on in my mind was really wierd and though provoking. I would only recommend this to an experienced drug user and I would make sure that you have friends who aren't on anything when you take this.<!--   End Body   -->

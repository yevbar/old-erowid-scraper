I had my first brush with opioid addiction about two months ago.<BR>
<BR>
First, I would like to give a little background on myself. I have been an avid drug user/psychonaut since my first Psilocybe experience at the age of 13. I enjoy the effects of psychedelics and feel that if they are used properly, a person can learn a great many things about themselves, the universe, and spirituality. On the other hand I like the effects of other substances, but feel that they take you places that you don't want to be.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, down to my story. One day a friend told me that he was receiving 250 40mg Oxycontin from a f.o.a.f. 'Cool I said, I've tried those before, they kick ass!' My friend decided to sell a few since he was broke and needed some cash. I couldn't believe how bad people wanted them/needed them. The phone was ringing off the hook for days, we were hounded by oxyheads day and night. The only other drugs that I have seen that do this are heroin, coke, and speed. People get down right nasty for this stuff. So much for the conception of a harmless pharmaceutical!<BR>
<BR>
We began to use the pills recreationally, sucking off the time release, crushing and snorting them. I should have got the hint when we started having to use more and more to achieve the desired effect. I was up to about 160 mgs for a heady, stony feeling. I never really craved the things, I just kept doing them because they were free, and I was bored.<BR>
<BR>
But eventually, the day came when we ran out. That's when the opioid monster kicked my ass. I was alright for a day. (I can feel a large dose of oxy into the next day, that's probably why the withdrawal was delayed.) Then at the end of the day at work, I began to feel ill.<BR>
<BR>
Sweating, headache, blurred vision, EXTREME nausea/vomiting. (Don't that sound like fun?) These were just some of the symptoms that I can put into words. I then realized that I hadn't taken a shit in about 6 days, it was a great time trying to rid myself of that load, let me tell ya! These symptoms lasted for about two days, slowly subsiding on the third.<BR>
<BR>
I've tried every kind of mind-altering substance you can think of, and this by far has the worst withdrawal. (In my opinion, worse than meth.)<BR>
<BR>
Now I can't even think about those things without feeling sick to my stomach. I'm lucky that I didn't feel any of the psychological addiction, I can't imagine wanting more!<BR>
<BR>
My advice, everything in moderation. It doesn't matter what the drug, if I overdo it I am in risk of losing my sanity, loved ones, my soul, and my life. If I want to get high, I stick to marijuana, if I overdo that, I am in risk of raiding the fridge and falling asleep.<!--   End Body   -->

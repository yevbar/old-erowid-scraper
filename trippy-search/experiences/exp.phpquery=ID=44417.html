<!--   Start Body   -->


A friend had acquired some blotter which he had tried recently in a low dosage and believed to be LSD. It was unperforated, and on thick blotter. I would normally take 4 or 5 hits of blotter, so I just ripped off a fat piece and started sucking on it. The first thing I noticed was the awful taste that reminded me somewhat of 2c-e. I thought that was very strange, but didn't really think too much of it. <BR>
<BR>
It took about two hours to kick in, and the visuals lacked the intricacy that is produced by L. I thought it might have just been weak-ass blotter at first, but a little after two hours after I took it I started to get sick. When the sickness wore off I began to trip fairly hard, but the visuals still were lacking as far as detail goes. I began to think that I had been duped into purchasing some 5-MeO-AMT or some other low dosage popular research chemical. 12 hours later into the trip I got dropped off at a friend's house and went into his apartment. As soon as I closed the door, complete darkness surrounded me, and when I went to find a light I couldn't. A blurry psychedelic room was actually drawn around me by my mind, it was so fucked up that I thought I had gone in the wrong door, and went in his neighbor's apartment. I was scared shitless by this thought, because if I made a sound to turn on a light and this wasn't my friend's house, the cops might be called. After all, a raving madman who can't find a light switch wanders into your house with pupils the size of quarters just rassling around in your hallway, what would most people do? So there I was squinting and opening my eyes wide to try to get rid of these colors and patterns completely obscuring my vision, trying to find a lightswitch by feeling around but just hitting the wall and whatnot... then my friend heard me. He turned on the light and I went upstairs and tried to crash.<BR>
<BR>
I laid around for a long time just feeling like my personality was being disassembled into individual personality traits I had picked up from others throughout my life. After a few hours of trying to crash I realized it wasn't going to happen so I got up and laid around in my friend's room (he had gone to work and let me chill there for a bit.) So I'm laying on his bed watching the outside, and seeing all the trees breathe in unison with the wind. My vision of the outside world looked sort of like a smudgy watercolor painting, but the visuals were still lacking in complexity. I laid around for a few more hours and said screw this, I'm gonna go for a walk. I walked like a maniac all around on the hottest day so far of this summer around here. I was sweating so profusely, and having jaw clenching. It was like I had ate a bunch of rolls. So I'm walking everywhere, and I just did not feel tired at all after being up for over 24 hours and tripping for the past 16-18. I end up meeting with my friends to smoke a blunt. The blunt smoke definately subdued my upset stomach for a bit, but within a couple hours it wore off. I was randomly dry heaving, and a couple times randomly heaving up the liquid I just drank.<BR>
<BR>
By nightfall, I was tripping just as hard as before, so I went to a keg party in the hopes of drinking myself to sleep. I busted out the half sheet to show my friend how much I took, and I actually took more than I thought, somewhere around 10 hits it seemed. I hadn't eaten in probably 36 hours or so, and drinking all night still didn't put me to sleep. My eyes were starting to wobble a little and make my vision blurry. When sunlight came, the world still looked like a smudgy watercolor painting. All hopes of coming down before the wedding I was to attend Sunday were shot down when I noticed this.<BR>
<BR>
I got an hour or two of semi-sleep, then went to the wedding. By this time I was beginning to come down and was a little relieved. I could actually stomach small amounts of food now. I went to bed somewhere between 6-9 sunday. I dosed friday night.<BR>
The next morning I had to get out of bed to do some dry heaving for a bit. I still had residual visuals for a couple days too.<BR>
<BR>
The next weekend I found out that the supplier of the supplier had been lying to people and selling sheets of DOI telling them it is acid. Each blotter was ~2 mg's. I guess this person never stopped to think that they were putting people in real danger by doing this. Anywho, it was kind of easy (IMHO) to tell this wasn't L for a few reasons: the visuals lacked detail, the come-up was too long, the sickness and nausea, and the amphetamine-like properties. Also, unlike with L, I had no feeling of being 'at peace' with things. If I had to describe this trip shortly, I'd probably call it a 'dirty' trip.<!--   End Body   -->

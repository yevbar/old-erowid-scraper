<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: 163.5 mgs of amphetamine is considered an extremely high dose, see amphetamine Dose Chart]</FONT> <br>
<br>
First off, a little background information. I am a 16 year-old male, about 155 lbs, a junior in highschool. I started experimenting with drugs about two years ago when I was 14. Since then, I've done mushrooms five times, LSD six times, DXM somewhere around five times, Dramamine once (and never again), opium once, hash a few times, salvia three or four times, cocaine five times, ritalin not sure how many times, xanax three times, and of course pot and alcohol an uncountable amount of times. Anyhoo....on with the story.<br>
<br>
Two days ago, I had the oppourtunity to try some adderall before school. Having heard many great things about the drug and being a fan of stimulants to a certain extent, I naturally jumped right at the offer. So my friend, M picked me up and we met our friend C, who was providing it, at a gas station at about 7:35a.m.. I purchased three pills at first. They were 25mg each. They were the ones with the tiny balls inside. I swallowed one and snorted another. It was definately easier to snort than ritalin or coke and the drainage wasn't very bad at all. M also snorted one and swallowed one. After we were done, off we went to school.<br>
<br>
When we got to school about 5 minutes later, I started to feel a small rush of speed coming on. It wasn't unlike the feeling of ritalin, but it also had somewhat of a body high. Feeling like I could take on the world, I went to PE. In PE we played volleyball. Usually in PE, I don't really care about what we're doing and I perform at my minimal ability, But at the time, I was actually participating and having fun.<br>
<br>
After PE, I had art class (8:35). At that time, I didn't feel like I was speeding very hard, but there were definately noticable effects. I was very talkative and my artistic abilities seemed to be better than usual. Every once in a while, I'd get a warm tingly feeling on my cheeks or the back of my head.<br>
<br>
I went to my next class, Greek and Roman Mythology, At 9:30. We were about to take a test, but I had to use the bathroom before I started, so I asked the teacher if I could go. So off I went to tinkle. When I was in the bathroom, I decided it would be a good time to take my third pill, since I wasn't feeling the speed too strong. So I took the capsule apart and tilted my head back and snorted it, being careful not to let any of the little balls to fall out. As I was walking back to class, I could definatley feel the speed getting stronger. I got back to class and took my test. Normally in this particular class, I usually fail my tests miserably, but that day, I managed to pass the test with a C. After the test, I began to draw some fucked up pictures for my friend. I was drawing really fast and it was pretty fun. Then I wrote a note to another friend. The note consisted of utter nonsence, but I wrote a whole page in a few minutes. I was definately speeding pretty nicely by then. <br>
<br>
My next class, American History, (10:20) was pretty fun because I sit by C, the guy who sold me the pills. We both talked about how great we felt and how we wanted to do more. So after class, we went into the bathroom and he gave me another pill and we each snorted one more. It was probably a mistake for me to go over that third pill my first time, but I was speeding and I didn't care, I just wanted to feel even better than I already did.<br>
<br>
Then I went to biology (11:10). We took notes which I wrote extremely fast. I felt like I could do anything. Nothing very interesting happened in that class. I just talked to this kid about cartoons.<br>
<br>
Then, I went to lunch (12:10). I was nowhere near hungry, So M, C, and my other friend F went outside. C sold F four pills and F did them all at once, which probably wasn't a great idea. Feeling like I would need some more later, I bought four more pills. Lunch was fun. None of us could stand still and we were all talking a mile a minute. I'm sure the people who saw us got a good kick out of it. Four crazy bastards speeding their balls off, being even more loud and obnoxious than usual. <br>
<br>
After lunch, I went to algebra (1:00). I got all my homework done pretty quick. Then, I had to pee again, so I went to the bathroom, pissed and decided it would be a good time to snort another. I went back to class and my nose was running really bad, so I blew my nose. I looked at the tissue and there was pinkish orange slime all over it. It looked pretty damn gross.<br>
<br>
Then, I went to my final perid of the day, Woodshop (2:00). By this time I was flyin'. I enjoyed that class because rather than just sitting and doing bullshit homework, I was actually moving around and doing stuff. This kid in my class started talking to me and he started laughing at me and asked why I was talking so fast.<br>
<br>
When school got out (2:45), I decided I was speeding way too fast to go home, so I went with M and B to their band's practice. On the way there, me and M each snorted one and a half more each. I was up to about 163 mg and I felt fucking fantastic. We popped in some Operation Ivy into the CD player and sang along. Whenever I would sing, my face and my head would get that warm, tingly feeling. It was nice. We got to S's house, where the band practice was and B and I stayed outside for a few minutes to smoke cigarettes. When I looked at the ground, it almost looked like it was moving a little bit. I almost felt like I was tripping. We went downstairs and I watched the band practice. They sounded fantastic. Music is always great to listen to when I'm speeding. Every once in a while, it would get too hot, so I would go outside and smoke a cigarette and play with S's dog, which was really fun.<br>
<br>
After they were done practicing, M and I dropped B off and went and sat at the park until I had to go home at 8:00. Luckily when I got home, my mom was already asleep, so I didn't have to talk to her. She would have definately known I was messed up because my pupils were huge, I had big purple rings under my eyes, and my eyes were extremely bloodshot. I went to my room and called my girlfriend and talked to her for about an hour and fifteen minutes. I thought she'd be mad at me for doing adderall because she's usually pretty upset when I do ritalin or coke, but I guess since I was just trying it for the first time she didn't really mind.<br>
<br>
I was really disapointed when she had to get off the phone because I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep and I didn't have anyone to talk to. So I just watched TV all night. At around 1:00-2:00am, I found a porno on TV and decided, 'Hey, I'm bored and there's a porno on, I must pleasure myself!' Masturbating was kind of a hassel because it was very hard for me to get an erection. And when I would get one, I couldn't maintain it for very long. Finally, after more than an hour of pulling my pork, I ejaculated. <br>
<br>
Feeling quite satisfied, I went to urinate. But when I was in the bathroom about to piss, I got a huge rush of blood to my head, and my entire body, and I almost blacked out. For a bit, my vision started to blur. Scared that I was going to fall down, I went back  to my room and sat down. When I sat, My heart rate was racing faster than it ever has. My heart rate when I was on coke didn't even compare to how fast it was pumping then. I got really scared that I had taken too much and was going to have a heart attack. If I layed still for a while, my heart would stop beating so fast, but if I sat up or turned or barely moved at all, my heart would start racing again. I spent the rest of the night worrying about how I had to go to school in a matter of hours and I was speeding faster than I had been when I took the shit. I just laid in bed and watched the clock. I had to go piss again, but I was too scared to walk to the bathroom  because I didn't want to black out like I almost did, so I pissed in a rootbeer bottle. <br>
<br>
Then at 6:30 my alarm clock went off and so I went and got ready for school. I was still speeding hard. I had almost been speeding for 24 hours by then. It freaked me out pretty bad. So school was pretty terrible yesterday. I was all wacked out from the drugs and sleep deprivation. I didn't want to talk to anybody and I was very irritable. I tried to sleep in all my classes but I was very unsuccesful. My chest was hurting and my heart was still racing all day. My stomach was hurting because I hadn't eaten anything since the day before I did the adderall. I felt like shit all day yesterday until I smoked some 'Northern Lights' bud with M. I finally got to sleep at around eleven last night.<br>
<br>
I don't think I'm going to be doing any stimulants, especially Adderall, for a very long time. I've never freaked out from stimulants as bad as I did that night. All in all, It was pretty fun until I stood up to take that piss. I definately took way too much for my first time. My advice to anyone curious about trying this drug is don't go overboard like I did.<!--   End Body   -->

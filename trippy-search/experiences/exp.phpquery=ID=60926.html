A BRIEF BACKGROUND:)<br>
<br>
Well to start I am 20 years old. At the age of 13 I experimented with marijuana and became a pot head. By the time I was 14 I did ecstasy about a dozen times and 1.7 grams of mushrooms. (Over a spread out time of course)  When I was 15 I was sent to a rehab for a year. After completion I stayed clean till I was about 18. I began drinking after 3 years of completely being clean of drugs and alcohol. I never became addicted to alcohol like I did marijuana. Anyway I wanted to do mushrooms once again, finally at the age of twenty I got my hands on them and decided to take them with a friend. <br>
<br>
MY PRESENT LIFE ON THE NIGHT OF MUSHROOMS:<br>
<br>
A couple months ago (from the night I took mushrooms) I broke up with my girlfriend because of my personal reasons. I stopped hanging out with most of my friends because of my differences with them. I was upset by this. I tried to talk to my  <br>
x-girlfriend in person. My girlfriend said she would meet me in person to talk. We spoke and it didn&#8217;t go well for me. I drove home from her house SLIGHTY upset. Not to mention that I was reunited with my old friends and I was having a tough time with all this.<br>
<br>
(THIS WAS THE SAME DAY THAT I TOOK MUSHROOMS, THOUGH I DIDN&#8216;T KNOW I WAS GONNA BE TRIPPING THAT NIGHT BECAUSE I GOT THE SHROOMZ LAST MINUTE//sry for caps)<br>
<br>
THE GOOD STUFF:) ///the trip on January 3rd 2007<br>
<br>
Now the reason you heard my sappy personal life is to see HOW THE PRESENT SITUATIONS IN YOUR LIFE CAN AFFECT YOUR MUSHROOM TRIP. About 5 days before I took the mushrooms I called my friend up and told him to find me some shrooms. He was unsuccessful&#8230;.until he calls me up on the night of 1/3/07 and says he has some caps and stems for me.  I buy a quarter ounce and split it with a friend who is a first-timer. I only knew I was gonna be eating mushrooms about an hour before I ate them. I didn&#8217;t have a day to mentally prepare myself. The first time I did shrooms which was 5 years ago, I ate a half 1/8 and had a nice pleasant mild trip. Anyway&#8230; We decided to eat a whole 1/8 each. I had a sore throat and didn&#8217;t eat anything but a PB and J at 3:00 pm that day.. I ate the shrooms straight at 9:00pm, on a very empty stomach. I was not gonna let a sore throat stop me from tripping. We walked out to the woods by my friend&#8217;s backyard and sat around a fire. My other friend who was straight edge was there to see the trip we were about to have. At 9:15  my legs were tingling up. My eyes were dilated and the porch lights began to look very bright and had trails. I honestly wondered if they were always that bright or if it was the shroomz. I was loving it. I had a huge smirk on my face and I couldn&#8217;t  wipe it off. THEY HIT QUICK&#8230; <br>
<br>
Eventually my friends mom walked to our wooded area behind the house (a mother Ok with son and son&#8217;s friends on shroomz, isn&#8217;t she great!). She asked me &#8220;how was your visit with your ex-girlfriend&#8221; , suddenly my friend asked me &#8220;you saw your ex-girlfriend today&#8221; He was very surprised because he knew of our troubles. I felt as if they were analyzing me and they all knew of the rejection I faced from my ex-girlfriend. &#8220;THEY WERE ALL JUDGING ME I THOUGHT&#8221; &#8220;THIS IS ALL MY FAULT&#8221;. I knew I was feeling it now. They went back in the house and I felt better. At 9:40 my friends and I proceeded to grab some soda and water from the house and grab some logs for the fire. By this point I really felt the shroomz. I felt great, I walked in the house grabbed some water and the lights in the house were extremely bright. Then at like 9:50 we all walked back outside and I was looking at the full moon. I thought it was beautiful, I was trying to walk around and look at the moon from a different angle. . <br>
<br>
After a couple of minutes of doing this I realized it was impossible. I then laughed at myself and realized how much fun I was having. (My friend who was tripping with me ate his at the same exact time but he seemed to have a nice mild trip) We eventually grabbed some logs and we got lost for about a minute in the small woods we were oh-so familiar with. I thought it was hilarious. By now I&#8217;m feeling euphoria and everything looks so vibrant with all lights looking bright. 10:00 , now I&#8217;m getting a little restless and the shroomz start really kicking in. I insist that we go back in the house. We did so and as I went in side, I looked at a hardwood floor and the grains in the wooden floor seemed to be rising up from it. I was like &#8220;holy shit&#8221;. While looking in the mirror I saw a beauty mark on my face and it began to move around on my face. My face also looked very &#8220;lizard like&#8221; almost like it had scales. My friend noticed this too. I was laughing hysterically and panicking all with in minutes. My clean friend said that it looked like I was having fun, but was feeling something completely different on the inside. He was completely right. <br>
<br>
I kept pacing around the house like a lost puppy. 10:40, I am sitting in my friends living room with my two friends (one-tripping and one not) and his mother and sister. They had fun bugging us out by saying completely random things. They brought up the subject of  my ex-girlfriend. That made me uncomfortable and I almost called her up ready to completely breakdown to her on the phone. I stopped myself, we were listening to the song &#8220;little red riding hood&#8221; by the rolling stones. I found it very scary. 11:00. I am now bugging out of my mind at this point and everyone can see. Races of thoughts were running through my mind and I don&#8217;t even remember what I was thinking. I remember that it seemed like 45 minutes where I was very panicked and I don&#8217;t know what about. I know this was my peak because I remember feeling fucked up and then the next thing I know I came down A LOT. 12:30, my face again looks normal and the grains in the wooden floor were not coming up out of the floor. My other friend still maintained a nice mild mellow LONGER trip than mine. I guess he ate a normal amount of food that day. My guess is the mushrooms burned right up in my stomach and that&#8217;s why my trip ended after 3.5 hours.<br>
<br>
I laid down and just rested only to throw up at like 2:00 in the morning. The next day I just took it easy. Mushrooms are fun but really shouldn&#8217;t be taken when something significant is going on in your life. Death of a family member, illness in the family, break up. You get the idea. Mushrooms aren&#8217;t like most drugs that will numb your emotions. Mushrooms will make you stare your emotions right in the face. <br>
So enjoy<br>

I haven't done Kratom before, and thought 3 grams would be a good dose to start with, so I mixed it through a cup of chocolate milk and heated it in the microwave.<br>
<br>
T 21:25 I ingested the cup of chocolate milk containing the Kratom. I didn't notice the bitter taste many people describe, it just tastes like chocolate milk always dose, the only difference is there's grounded up herbs floating in it.<br>
<br>
T 21:47 I read that 3 grams of premium is a rather small amount, so I decide to redose and take the other 3 grams. I mix it through chocolate milk again, and heat it in the microwave.<br>
<br>
T 21:55 I ingest a second cup of chocolate milk, containing 3 grams of premium Kratom. Total amount of premium Kratom ingested is 6 grams.<br>
<br>
T 22:25 I don't feel much, almost nothing at all.<br>
<br>
T 22:45 I'm finally feeling some of the warm opiate feeling, also, I'm more social, and just had a short conversation and really enjoyed it. The warm feeling is slightly increasing, and I'm also feeling relaxed. It's time to listen to some Coldplay and Massive attack.<br>
<br>
T 23:00 I'm defenitavely feeling some of the warm opiate feeling, and pretty relaxed, listening to some Coldplay. Time also appears to fly, 15 minutes seems like just a couple of minutes. I don't think the feeling is going to increase much, which is a bit of a bummer for the price I had to pay for the Kratom, but I'm certainly going to order some more, and try a bigger dose next time.<br>
<br>
T 23:15 I still feel the same as 15 minutes ago, though the feeling seems to fade away when I walk around. When I sit or lay down, the feeling starts to increase again, but fades away when I move around again.<br>
<br>
T 23:30 The feeling seems to have faded, I'm feeling very little at the moment, though my mind is still a bit clouded.<br>
<br>
I barely feel the warm opiate feeling I had earlier ago, the feeling appears to come up en fade away again after a while.<br>
<br>
T 00:06 I'm feeling some of the warm feeling again, I'm going to grab a blanket, rap it around myself, and get cosy. On second though, I didn't grab the blanket, I just stayed on my chair, and continued surfing Drugs-forum.<br>
<br>
T 00:50 I'm still feeling relaxed, but the warm feeling is gone, I'm practically at baseline. This experience wasn't as good as I hoped for, but I'm definetafely going to do it again with a higher dose.<br>
<br>
T 01:23 I thought it was over, but some weird feeling is coming back again, I'm feeling weird in my stomach, I'm going to get a glass of milk.<br>
<br>
T 02:24 I'm still feeling a bit 'weird', though no other effects are noticed.<!--   End Body   -->

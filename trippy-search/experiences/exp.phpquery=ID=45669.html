<!--   Start Body   -->


As an adjunct to daily 100mg Zoloft (Sertraline), I have been experimenting with once- or twice-daily insufflated 2C-E. Antidepressants mostly affect serotonin, so I figured this hallucinogen would be like a boost to the antidepressant I take, and fun too.<BR>
<BR>
I am 34 years old and have extensive (albeit 10 to 15 years ago) experience with LSD and psilocybin, also all manner of pharmaceutical uppers, downers and all-arounders.<BR>
<BR>
I tried around 8mg of this 2C-E once (about 6 weeks before I am writing this), and in my over-30-years-old-long-time-since-I-tripped state, it was tooooo much! I was glad when THAT was over. Decent open-eye visuals on oriental carpets, but I got sweaty and felt really hot and couldn't get to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
I take the drug as an aqueous solution, at 1mg/ml concentration, sniffed in equal parts up each nostril, measured with an oral dosage syringe.<BR>
<BR>
I have noticed that this substance provided me with quite a lift first thing in the morning (around 6am), and aided in preventing that after-lunch urge I almost always have to nap, especially when an additional dose is taken around 11am.  Napping at work was counter-productive, but I could get away with it by closing the door to my office. I don't like to, because I always worry that the boss will find out I'm in there sleeping! Not to mention I don't get any work done while sleeping.  So, small doses of 2C-E help with that.<BR>
<BR>
Some very slight, and sometimes amusing psychedelic effects come from this manner of taking 2C-E. I noticed when riding public transportation to and from work that I feel that I can look at people and judge their mental states better than without being under the influence of 2C-E. Definitely still works some psychic magic at these small doses.<BR>
<BR>
Casual 'water-cooler' conversation at work was enhanced, although sometimes too much. I find myself talking a little to loudly.  I think this is from the slight 'adrenergic push' that the drug can have, as Shulgin writes in PIHKAL.  <BR>
<BR>
Physical exercise was interesting on these low doses of 2C-E, but sometimes it's a little harder to get motivated to do it (I work out in the morning); I'd rather just do something else. The after-effects of exercise are nicer on 2C-E.<BR>
<BR>
All kinds of activities of daily living were possible at 1mg-2mg once or twice daily of 2C-E. Interactions at the grocery store were sometimes a little more interesting than without it - ordinary things take on a whimsical air.  Sex, however, was unspectacular, in fact some degree of erectile dysfunction was encountered due to the adrenergic aspect of the drug (at least for me, I don't know about the sexual effects it has on females, or on other males, for that matter).<BR>
<BR>
I think this substance is a good way to add a little 'kick.'  I periodically have stopped for a couple days, to let the rapid tolerance dissapate, and have noticed better effects after this short 'holiday.'<BR>
<BR>
As the reader may or may not know, this stuff can be totally mind-blowing at higher doses. BE CAREFUL if you intend on doing what I am writing about here.  Walking into work with a head full of 2C-E (or any psychedelic, really) was NOT A GOOD IDEA. I could have end up losing my job or arrested or both. <BR>
<BR>
This dosage of the substance has absolutely no effect on appetite for or taste of food, and no effect on sleep either (except of course I took it at bedtime).<BR>
<BR>
Peace.<!--   End Body   -->

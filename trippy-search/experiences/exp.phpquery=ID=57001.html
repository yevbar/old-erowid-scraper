This is my first experience of Belladonna. I am still relatively sane so am typing this as I am tripping. Started tripping last night. Me and a friend of mine found a Belladonna plant and took some home with us for me to try. My friend has done a lot of Datura/Brugmansia while I had never tried anything more than mushrooms and cactus.<br>
<br>
I'm not entirely sure how much we took so I am estimating in saying we both took about 1 teaspoon worth of flowers, then I left to go to a metal gig in town.<br>
While at the gig I had 2 bottles of Jim Beam and coke and we then went outside to have a pipe of weed.<br>
<br>
Well not long after having the weed too the trip started to come on.  I was at the back of the audience with another 1 of my friends when I started hearing people talking behind me and I would see heaps of people all standing there talking. The only person behind me was my friend and she was too busy headbanging to be talking.  I started to feel very claustraphobic so I went outside to sit in the carpark.  By this time my heart was beating furiously and I wasn't sure if I was going to pass out or throw up.  The trees across the road were swaying then jumped up and down and went all over the place.<br>
<br>
Eventually we decided to head home, the trip seemed to abate a bit while I was walking apart from the odd minor hallucination, but when we got home I opened the front door and a grey and white cat ran out of the house and onto the footpath then vanished.  When I got inside I went to pick up a plate of catfood off the floor(I don't even have a cat).  I went to sleep pretty much as soon as I sat down.<br>
<br>
Still feeling the effects slightly from last night, I decided to have another trip tonight so my friend boiled the leaves and made a tea for me to take.  I took that but didn't feel any effect so we boiled the stalks and I took that too.  That was about 2 hours ago.  We then had some weed.  I'm feeling pretty good now, the effects are nothing too spectacular.  I have had no memory loss or such like.  I am still able to type this, though at times that does prove difficult as I keep seeing things that distract my attention and I find it difficult to tell the keys on the keyboard apart.<br>
<br>
I do not feel dillusional.  I am still able to realise what I am imagining and what is real.  But the hallucinations are really quite fun.  The ornaments and posters move.  I have a wizard on the shelf that waves to me every now and then and a grim reaper moddle on top of the computer that whenever I look away (at the keyboard) he flies around the room.  But when I look at it, it lands back on the computer again.  lol.  I keep hearing noises and seeing things move out of the corner of my eyes.<br>
All in all it has been a pretty good trip and I have many hours left of it although I am feeling rather sleepy.<!--   End Body   -->

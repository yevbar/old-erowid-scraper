I have never gotten the chance to try a Dox compound despite experimenting with various other Rcs. When some came around I could not wait. I had 6 hits which came on rainbow colored sugar cubes. This is a long report of the events of the trip and how the drug made me react to them, there is a summary at the end.<br>
<br>
I began by simply eating one of the rainbow colored sugar cubes at around 7:00PM<br>
<br>
I spent this time hanging around in my room with a friend playing guitar and just listening to music, looking at stupid shit on youtube.<br>
<br>
At around 9:00PM I was feeling a great sense of peace filling me. No matter what was happening or what was going on I felt like I could just be chill. It was like having a feeling that everything was the perfect moment at the time. Me and my friend walked over to his dorm and ended up having an acoustic jam out in the hall in his building. I was able to just sit and almost be enveloped by the music, again all I could feel is peace.<br>
<br>
At around 9:30 I ate another cube<br>
<br>
We sat around and jammed for an hour when we decided to head over to my friends house who was having a jungle juice party. This was going to be an adventure. Neither of us owned a car so we would have to jump on the public transit and ride that for an hour and a half. At this point I was beginning to see visuals. We stopped off to pick up some sish and cigs at the tobacco shop and I could see some shifting and moving of the carpet below me if I focused.<br>
<br>
The train ride seemed to take forever and no time at all. I felt like hurrying was not possible. We spend so much of are time worrying about where we are heading that we forget to enjoy the moment, can describe the state of mind I was in.<br>
<br>
It was 11:30 and we reached the end of the line where another friend was coming to pick us up. I chilled there smoking a cigarette again just feeling a sense of total and utter peace with me and the world.<br>
<br>
At 11:35 I took two more cubes<br>
<br>
My friends picked us up and we got to the party. I have no problem tripping in party situations of 20-30 people. I sat around smoking hookah and kind of chatting with people as I was the only one tripping and everyone else was just getting shit faced drunk. My trip was still at a peaceful state of tranquility. It was interesting to watch the people around me fall apart as they slowly descended into drunkenness. <br>
<br>
Just around when everyone starting passing out at around 2:35 am my trip really started to hit me. I was sat outside for around 45 minutes smoking and watching the clouds shift and flow like an incredibly complex lava lamp in the sky. It was after this that I decided to go inside as it was probably around 15 degrees even though I did not feel it. Also things began to get much more intense.<br>
<br>
The next five or six hours were very intense, I began to come down at around 6am. I began to withdraw from reality if I was not directly engaged with someone. I would leave my body because I ceased to function in my surroundings. In my head it was like every memory was being linked with new ideas and surroundings. It was like complete abstraction in my mind. It was like having vivid dreams while completely awake. I jammed on another guitar but kept losing focus unless I really concentrated or was talking to someone.<br>
<br>
For probably an hour or two I was completely lost inside my own mind space, it was in no way scary, I was all ready so at peace that the slow build up had given me that I was completely ready to let go into my own mind.<br>
<br>
The next morning at around 8am things had mellowed out, things were barely moving but I still was still definitely in a tripping state of mind. I was able to eat a huge breakfast at ihop, but I had not eaten anything the day before.<br>
<br>
At around two or three in the afternoon I had made it back home. I was no longer having visuals but my pupils were still big black saucers and I was still in a different mind state.<br>
<br>
At around 3:30pm I ate a hit of acid<br>
<br>
I was not really expecting the acid to really have that much of an affect. I had started drinking from a jug of wine no one had wanted the night before and having passed on alcohol I was ready to mellow out a little bit.<br>
<br>
But sure enough about an hour in I was starting to just feel that lsd magic, and mind state. Two hours in I was getting great acid visuals, I must have still been tripping on the DOM and the visuals and mindstate I was in was definately still somewhat dom.<br>
<br>
At around 8pm I ate two more sugar cubes<br>
<br>
At around 9pm me and some friends headed over to a house party where there would be a live reggage/rock band playing. We got there right as they were setting up. I ending up drinking about six or seven beers over the course of the party. There ended up being like seventy people in a tiny room dancing out to reggage. It was around 11PM and I had felt the acid start to wear off. But still I was in an incredibly peaceful mindset. I could just feel the good vibes coming off everything. I still had all the energy in the world despite being up for forever. <br>
<br>
I was back in my room at around 2am and ended up eating a little more. Things were really starting to die down. I ended up listening to music and ended up passing out at around 3am. I woke up the next day at around 9am and still felt a little strange, but fell asleep fine the next night after just sitting around my room all day.<br>
<br>
Overall I can say DOM is an amazing drug, it is by far my new favorite research chemical. The first night was an incredibly spiritual experience. The only other research chemical I have ever found to have any spiritual value was 2C-T-2. DOM is definitely not a party drug, it has a very introspective peaceful quality to it. Yet the second night with the acid it gave a feeling of just being able to have a great time. There is no other way to describe it, it is truly deserving of the title Serenity, Tranquility, and Peace.<!--   End Body   -->

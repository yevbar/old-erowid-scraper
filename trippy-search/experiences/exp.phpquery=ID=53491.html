It was a Thursday night after work in the factory I worked in.  I had the next day off and had next day off, thus I invited over a friend to binge drink as was the norm for me then.<BR>
<BR>
I was 20 at the time and had a bad run of relationships and death.  Feeling depressed and sore, I turned to alcohol to ease the pain of a night, often having straight shots immediately after I got home from work to get past the initial soberness then drinking for 5+ hours.<BR>
<BR>
Drinking since I was 14, bourbon no longer had much of a effect on me, so I turned to stronger stuff:  Absinthe.<BR>
<BR>
My friend had recently been experimenting with pharmaceuticals + alcohol, and encouraged me to try this.  I had had 3 shots of Absinthe before he came over, and we proceeded to take straights shots of our alcohol (him vodka, me absinthe).  Over the course of the next 4 hours I had 13 shots of absinthe and 4 valerian tablets.<BR>
<BR>
I awoke with a room full of vomit.  The rest of the night can only be told from what I think happened.  I fell down my stairs from 2nd  storey to first at some point, I found a pool of vomit and blood in my bathroom (I believe I had a blood nose from smashing it on the stairwell)  My bedroom was covered in vomit and there was a towel in it.  I believe I passed out trying to clean it up.  I also knocked my stereo speakers off its cabinet and I had a bloodied knee, I recall bumping into something in the night and having a fire in my kneecap.<BR>
<BR>
It took 2 weeks for my room to smell normal again.<BR>
<BR>
I awoke without any traces of a hangover and I thought the night ended normally with me going to bed drunk but ok.  Was I in for a surprise that morning?<!--   End Body   -->

I stumbled upon Bromo-Dragonfly by mistake; an unreliable person who I did not see often owed me some money, and I figured. He offered to give me several tabs of Bromo-Dragonfly instead of paying me the money he owed me. At first, I said no, but after hearing some trip stories about the drug, I figured it might be fun to try.<br>
<br>
I had the tabs for a long while, never really having an appropriate time to dose; I heard it was a long-lasting trip, and I prefer to trip with at least one other friend, so it took me a bit to find someone who was interested in doing it. The first time I did it, I took what I thought was a tab, only to find out it was a half-tab. All it did was give me stomach problems and make me sleepless. My friend later told me that apparently I had only done a half-tab, so the second time around I dosed with 3 half-tabs, and my friend dosed with 2 half-tabs.<br>
<br>
We were kind of unprepared for it. We had both woken up somewhat late on a Saturday morning, a little bit hungover from a night of drinking before. We were trying to decide if we should dose or not; the weather was poor, we weren’t feeling so great, etc., but we ended up forcing it a bit because we had been wanting to try it for so long and our plans kept on getting screwed up. We both dosed around 12:30PM. I knew it took a long while to kick in, so we walked into the woods along a nature path where we had been building a bit of a hut for fun the past couple of weeks. The come-up was very long, and for the most part, it felt similar to being high on marijuana. We left the woods after only several minutes, due to the poor weather. We continued to try to find cool spots in nature to walk around, but it was difficult to be comfortable with the poor weather. Eventually, we decided to go back to my friend’s boat and watch TV and see where the Bromo took us. Around 3:00PM, we both realized we were getting pretty intense visuals, similar to that of an acid trip.<br>
<br>
We watched several movies on TV and would occasionally go outside so my friend could have some smoke breaks. Every time we went back in the boat, my trip would become much more intense; the lighting inside the boat seemed to help the trip, much more so than the bleak outdoors. After standing outside for about 20 minutes, I had decided I was going to drive home in order to get some warm clothes, because I was only wearing shorts and a t-shirt in drizzly 65F weather, and I figured, if I was going to trip, I would prefer to be comfortable. Having been outside for 20 minutes, I didn’t think I was tripping that hard, so I assumed I would be ok to drive. As soon as I got on to the highway to go back home, I instantly realized I was extremely uncomfortable driving. The highway was surrounded by trees, and I thought I was driving through a jungle. I began hallucinating sounds, thinking there were fire truck or ambulance sirens in the distance. I kept checking my mirrors to see where the emergency vehicles were coming from until I realized that I was just hallucinating.<br>
<br>
When I got home, I changed quickly and drove back to my friend’s boat. <FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</FONT>  I was still uncomfortable driving, but I knew the short drive was necessary so I could be re-united with my friend and we could be in good spirits again, as I wasn’t enjoying the trip by myself. I got there at around 5PM, but we had to leave, because the boat was going to be in use for the night, so we made another short drive back to his house, where we could comfortably listen to music and watch movies, as no one else was around. We got back safe and sound and I was happy to not be on the road anymore. At this point we turned on the TV and watched several uplifting movies that made the trip more pleasant. As with any other hallucinogen, I’ve experienced the setting to make a big impact on the type of trip you have, but I noticed that the Bromo seemed to respond more heavily to the setting. Earlier in the day, we had been in bleak and dreary weather, I had been uncomfortably cold, and we had been watching several shoes and movies on TV earlier, which had been too heavy for me at the time, putting me in poor spirits. However, once we were back at the house and in a comfortable setting, the trip became much more pleasant for me; I could enjoy the visuals and the altered state of mind, which at this point (duration aside), seemed very similar to an LSD trip.<br>
<br>
Throughout the night, the trip would come in waves. As mentioned, the trip was intensely different depending on what the setting was and what I was doing. If I turned on music (we were listening to House and Dubstep), I would get a surge of energy and have an urge to dance, having feelings similar to a mild MDMA roll. However, if I got comfortable on my friend’s couch and we watched TV, I would become intensely drowsy and slip into a state that felt like a marijuana high.<br>
<br>
Around 2AM, I thought I was done tripping, so I tried to go to sleep. However, once I got in bed in a dark secluded room, my trip intensified. I tried to fall asleep, but I was experiencing intense closed-eye visuals. I felt a presence of demons dancing around me. It didn’t frighten me too much, but became annoying at this point, because my body was tired and I wanted to get some rest.<br>
<br>
Around 9AM, I got out of bed having not slept a single minute, and drove home. I tried to relax at home and eat some food, as I hadn’t eaten much the day before, but the Bromo messed with my stomach intensely. My experience that day was horrendous. Much worse than any alcohol hangover I’ve ever had, and I’ve had some bad ones, being a bit of a binge drinker. A combination of sleep deprivation and an unsettled stomach, mixed with cloudy thinking made my day of recovery a really poor experience.<br>
<br>
Having tripped on Bromo, I can say I’m glad that I have the experience under my belt, but I probably wouldn’t want to do it again, mostly for the fact that it’s such a big time commitment. And, for me, it resembled an LSD trip with some of the elements removed from LSD tripping that I enjoy: the euphoric and fairly quick come-up, a generally easy come-down where I can begin to reflect on my trip, and the seemingly appropriate duration of the trip, which can be fun for a Saturday afternoon.<!--   End Body   -->

Recently my buddies and me found a place to get cocaine. The first time I tried it was about 2 years ago and I really liked it then.  So I decided to buy a gram.  I knew from experience it was addicting but forgot how addicting. My friend and me when to house and chopped the powder that was white and kind of moist and it stuck together if you pushed on it. I took a quarter gram and broke it into 3 lines and snorted one right away. It was about 3 o'clock P.M. In about 5 to 7 minutes I felt extremely awake and my mood that was already good just got a lot better.  My four friends and me decided to chill for a second and we all started to bullshit, which is really easy.  My thoughts came fast and I was able to be way more open and say everything that came to mind.  I felt stronger, faster, and more confident.  After about 2 hours I was down and it just suddenly comes without warning.  So I decided to take another.  I was right back up again but not as good as before.  I started to realize why this stuff is so addicting after just one line I feel like I should take more just to be normal again when it comes down.  <BR>
<BR>
I noticed my tolerance was way up just after one line also.  I started to come down around an hour.  Some of my friends where at ease and could really control there self and didn't mind the crash at all and one of my friends got really tired when he took it. I had never seen a person do that before. After an hour I took another line and another 20 minutes after.  I got really sped up and it really felt good for about 40 minutes.  I think it is one of the best feeling drugs I have tried even more then ecstasy but all of a sudden I just crashed.  I felt like complete shit.  I felt tired  but couldn't sleep I wasn't happy at all.  I didn't like to talk to people because it felt like too much effort.  Then I realized a system that was easier to stick by I call sliding.  Take a little at a time and space them out and except the slide.  If I take a lot I won't slide I will fall and crash.  I stuck to that system until 12 AM.  I ran out and really wanted more.  I started to be stupid and was trying to think of ways to get more even though I didn't have that much money and shouldn't be spending it.  <BR>
<BR>
My friend heard about my idea and started to tell me how stupid it would be to buy more and I realized that.  An hour had gone by since I did my last line and I wanted some so bad that I was not happy at all.  I just wanted to go home so I split up from my friends and went to my room and tried to sleep. When it was about 3 am I realized I wasn't going to go to sleep and I'm feeling the worst I have ever felt before on any drug.  One of my friends got a Valium and he said to took the crash away completely and he felt really good.  I didn't have one but I did have valerian root and remember taking a lot of it one time and it felt like Valium.  So I took 4 of the pills even though the bottle said to take 2, drank some chamomile and smoked some cannabis.  It wasn't long before I was starting to feel better and I could sleep again.  <BR>
<BR>
After my experience I think you should probably never even try this drug. Ignorance is bliss.  But if you do decide to try it anyway do it in small lines and if you feel like you want to keep on doing it like most people I know. Throw it away or is will consume your time and you will always think about it.  It will become a big priority in your life. I have tried many drugs and if you know me you know I’m not entirely against them if your in the proper setting but I think cocaine is evil and you should stay away from it I have not found any right time or place to do this drug.  If you where about to do this drug or thinking about it I hoped I have helped you decide not to do this drug.<!--   End Body   -->

I have smoked weed almost everyday for about 7 months. I am a pothead. So what happened to me scared the hell outta me. I wasn't conscious for most of this, so this is mostly what my boyfriend told me. <BR>
<BR>
Me and my boyfriend had just smoked 2 bongs of really good weed. We were stoned out of our minds. We had plans to meet with a friend so we went upstairs to leave. We walked up the stairs to the kitchen. I did not feel well. I felt dizzy and a little sick to my stomach. I sat down in a chair, wrapped my arms around my stomach and told him that I didnt feel well. That is all I remember for a while. What happened after that I was not concious for.<BR>
<BR>
He said I put my head down, I still had my arms wrapped around my stomach. I started breathing in and out very hard. I looked up at him and my eyes went pure black. Dilated as all hell. There was no emotion in my face. At that time my mouth went completely open and I started arching my back. I put my neck back as far as it would go. I was as tensed up as I could be. So, I'm in this chair, mouth wide open, eyes completely dialated and wide open, not awake, and arched back as far as I could. I went to fall out of the chair, still arched and tensed. My boyfriend helped me to the floor. He was yelling my name but I did not respond. I still didnt un-tense. He laid me on the ground and I was still having all the symptoms. He descirbed me as holding up my entire body by only my feet and my head. I stayed unconcious for a little while, people were trying to wake me up, but nothing worked. <BR>
<BR>
When I did wake up I was on the floor with people all around me. When I first woke up I still could not respond or move. I was finally able to move and talk, but didnt know anything was even wrong. I thought I was still sitting in the chair. I thought I had just told him I didnt feel well. I laid there and stared at the ceiling for a second, not knowing anything had happened. I finally realized something had gone wrong when I heard his mom say there was an ambulance on the way. Thats when I realized I was on the floor and I was dizzy and sick. I didnt feel well enough to really move. I still just stayed there. I didnt even think to ask what had happened for a while. I finally thought too and they said they didnt know, that it could have been a seizure. I just laid there until the ambulance came. I still felt very sick, like if I moved I was going to pass out. I was dizzy and I wanted to go to sleep so bad. I felt though, that if I fell asleep I was going to die. They had to carry me out on a strecher because I didnt feel as if I could get up. They took me to the ER.<BR>
<BR>
I didnt sit up for about 2 hours after this happened. I was awake and everything but I just felt like I was going to die. I was answering questions with small sentences. I couldnt talk much. <BR>
<BR>
They didnt give me any medicine. After time I felt better. I sat up, still wasnt very responsive, but became responsive. From the time it happened to the time I was sitting up and talking in sentences was about 4 hours.  The tests showed nothing besides my weed usage. They told me not to smoke weed again. Saying that was the cause.<BR>
<BR>
This whole thing was very scary and I hate that I cant even remember most of it. I have never seen weed do that to anyone before. Either way, I'm not smoking weed anymore.<!--   End Body   -->

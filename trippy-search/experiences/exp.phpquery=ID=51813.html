INTRODUCTION :<br>
I've been told of the psychoactive properties of Salvia before, but nobody could have prepared me for my evening. I was actually under the impression that it would be a very mild, very short trip. I've taken many types of mood/awareness/sight enhancing drugs, but Salvia kicked my goddamned ass. When my buddy A came down from Washington for a visit last week, he told us (myself [N], my wife [K] and our 3 roommates [T] [S] and [C] and our friend [J]) that he'd ordered some Salvia Divinorum for us to try during his stay. It didn't show up until the last day of his visit but, hey, at least it came. <br>
<br>
The 6 of us spent the day cleaning and preparing a space for ourselves to trip, and by 9:30, we were super stoney and ready to try this stuff out. With the exception of A, we were all virgins to Salvia and had no idea what to expect. A had prepared us only by letting us know that it hits hard and fast, and that it lasts about 10 minutes. He said we needed a water pipe and a butane lighter. We never had the chance to find a butane lighter, but my bong has a nice large bowl, so we were set. We decided to take our hits individually, one at a time, with two people in the room to help out if need be.<br>
<br>
Let the games begin. S took his hit first, and didn't do much of anything but sit there and try and grab at stuff. Later he would say he didn't see anything wierd at all. I sure as hell did.<br>
<br>
MY SIDE OF THE STORY AKA THE SCARIEST AND MOST CONFUSING TRIP I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED (but fun as hell looking back!) :<br>
<br>
My drug background: Psilocybe Cubensis (magic mushrooms) about 3 or 4 times, LSD, Exctacy, whip-its, Nitrous, regular smoker of Marijuana, regular lucid dreamer<br>
<br>
I sat in the big papa-san chair in our den (the big wicker type shaped like a bowl). In front of me is our dining-room table, which is where the bong is sitting. There are a bunch of crazy tapestries in there, and one of my paintings. A little marijuana in the bottom of the bowl, and a good heap of Salvia on top. Here we go. I breathed deeply in and out for a while and took my hit. I remember leaning forward to take the last of the smoke and then, blackness. I felt exactly like I had fallen asleep.<br>
<br>
As I started to feel and see things, all manner of images faded into my vision like the beginning of a strange movie. There were pictures and memories and tiny little fragments of reality thrown in every once and a while, and then I started to dream. Pieces of my memories were being spliced together and thrown at me at a blinding speed! I slowly started to hear voices coming from all around me, voices from my past and present, voices of my family and friends from California, when I was still a kid. I was 12 years old and had just started learning to ride a skateboard in front of my old house. Immediately it went sliding out from underneath me and I went flying! I was in the thrashing surf at Huntington Beach and being flung all over by the pounding waves! <br>
<br>
All of a sudden I landed somewhere. I heard my mother screaming, and there were people standing over me. I couldn't quite see them, because the sun was blinding me, but I felt like I was going to pass out, and my whole body began tingling with extreme pain and numbness so I didn't care that I couldn't see. I looked down and saw something that looked like a raw piece of meat, but that hurt my eyes to look at too. Everything in my vision was pulsating/zooming inwards until I had horrible tunnel-vision. My mom was still screaming and it felt like I'd been lying there for hours. I heard some new voices shouting and my vision began to clear a little.<br>
<br>
That's when I saw the most frightening thing I've ever seen in my entire life. I had fallen over headfirst onto a tall slab of metal that was sharpened all along the top edge like a blade. It had cut me in half all the way from the top of my head to the middle of my stomach and I was lying doubled over it with one half of my head and torso on one side of the blade, and one half on the other. I heard the new voices telling me that everything was going to be all right. The figures attached to the new voices were paramedics, and they were vomiting and cursing and weeping to see this poor guy who had fallen and cut himself in half.<br>
<br>
I didn't know what I was going to do, so I tried to get up off the blade. I was so heavy that my arms wouldn't work, so I started flapping my arms at terrible speed, flapping for my life. Somehow I managed to get off the blade and stand upright but when I did, the two halves of my head/torso split and fell down to each side! I started screaming in pain and running around in the street, but it hurt so much I just fell over and lay there, only to witness another horrifying sight.<br>
<br>
The piece of meat I had seen earlier was my brain, and when I fell over I was looking out my left eye and seeing the inside of the right half of my severed head and neck! I stood up again screaming and looked around. I was in my den again but still not in my right mind. The next thing I remember seeing, I was walking around in the living room looking for someplace to lie down again, because my body felt so heavy. I remember yelling at everyone to get out! Get out! They were all laughing and ran into the other room. I went to my room and got naked, because my clothes started to hurt my skin, and I lay down in bed and tried to piece together what had just happened to me.<br>
<br>
I still thought I was dying and was breathing super heavily. My body ached all over and was still pretty numb, and my foot hurt for some reason. Finally I remembered that I had taken a hit of Salvia and was coming down, which made me more relieved than I have ever been. I felt like I'd been gone for months. S and K came in once in a while to see how I was doing, I told them I got cut in half and they said 'What?'<br>
<br>
THIER SIDE OF THE STORY<br>
The other side of the story (what happened in reality) was just as crazy, but alot funnier than my side of it. I guess as soon as I took the hit, I flung my arms back against the window and leaned forward in the papa san chair until it tipped upward, pinning me between the chair and the table! They uprighted me, and then I went nuts. I flung my legs in the air and sent the bong flying (good thing we've got thick carpet), came back with my legs and swept the rest of the stuff on the table off onto the floor. <br>
<br>
Then, I took out the table and got stuck under it. Finally I crawled out from under it and tried to go through the curtain to the hallway, but got stuck in it. I turned around towards the kitchen and saw T. After a second I charged him and chased him into the laundry room. Then I chased J around the living room. Then I sat in the hallway for a while, and then told everyone to get out. After they left, I went to my room and slept through C's trip and K's trip. Everyone said that I hadn't made a sound through the whole thing, except at the very beginning, when I said 'Guys?' and that was that. My trip probably lasted about 8 or 9 minutes.<br>
<br>
CLOSING<br>
When I came out of hiding, T was about to take his hit in his room. I decided to be his lighter-bitch and see what happened to him. He tripped nearly as hard as I did and actually screamed for about 2 minutes straight. Later he told us that he was in an insanity ward and we were his guards keeping him imprisoned. A listenened to some Nick Cave while he tripped and saw a vortex into the television. I was definitely severely disturbed by my whole experience, but everyone else was pretty excited about their trips and I'm pretty sure I'd do it again, now that I really know what will happen to me. Hopefully it's not that crazy next time. I'll be staying away from large blades for a while.<!--   End Body   -->

This is more detailed report on my Friday 13th 2C-E trip. I had experience on 18mg 2C-E that blew all my previous trips out of the water. <BR>
<BR>
Mind set: Calm and resting after work day.<BR>
Setting: In my house alone.<BR>
Dose and Substance: Oral 18mg 2C-E dissolved in water.<BR>
Stomach content: Last eat 6h before(little snack )and at ingestion time stomach was really empty.<BR>
Previous trips on 2C-E: Around 6-8 times with doses from 5mg to 20mg.<BR>
<BR>
T+0/20:37PM<BR>
So, all began when I ingested 18mg of 2C-E dissolved in class of water and syrup. I drunk 3/4 of class in one breath take and other 1/4 30min later. It was weird at first. This hasn't happened to me before with 2C-E or any other substance. I waited and waited and at 1h mark, I still didn't felt anything. Usually, I feel it within 45min. I went to bathroom to look my pupils and they were normal. I thought maybe my 2C-E was degraded in two months when I last tried it. But I felt that it starts to affect me, cause I yawn many times like before all my trips.<BR>
<BR>
T+75min/21:52PM<BR>
I felt strong body load and energy building. With that, I knew something big was coming. Now I know what means 'hit like ton of bricks'. I went down stairs to bathroom. My sense of depth was disturbed. I think that the reason why my motor skills were not working probably. I stare my bathroom wall and floor. Visuals look much different than in my pervious trips. They have much more content to them. With just 15min, I was brought from +1 on shulgin scale to intense +3. Visuals were patterning and persian carpet type. I saw halos every where. And it was just beginning. At the end of T+75min my visual field was floored with intense visuals, that I couldn't almost see in this visual soup.<BR>
<BR>
I decided to lay on my bed. Due to the body load, that was uncomfortable. But it didn't last long. It subsided around T+90min - T+110min. Then I was brought level up by mentally. It got mentally challenging at that point. But nothing frightening or uncomfortable... just mental fuck one can have on heavy trip.<BR>
<BR>
Music wasn't same as it was before. I was listening Pink Floyd - The Best Of and at some point, I wasn't understanding what song was playing. Music wasn't music in normal sense... it was far more distorted than I've heard before. I wasn't aware if my eyes were open or closed. I just were in extreme psychedelic state, that normal reality was left. Now, heres something hard to explain for me. My short term memory was gone. I can't remember nothing at least 30-45minutes. I can't describe the state state or place I was in, cause I don't remember anything about it. What ever happened, I know it had some meaning behind it and I don't regret it. I think it was around T+150min or T+180min when I was again able to see with my eyes(I was aware now that they are open) and can remember from here on. So, I decided to smoke a bong. To smoke a bong, I needed to go down stairs. The walk there was funny. Every step I made sounded like little away from me and with little delay. It also had distorted tone, but I don't know how to describe it. My motor skills was same as before, but I there wasn't much problem to get downstairs. Body load was weaker now and the allowed me to consentrate to other effects.<BR>
<BR>
After smoking, I was calmed down and brought to state of serenity. I was floating with music and I wasn't worried about past or about the future. I existed at the moment... living throughout every second with timeless sense to it. I also started to watch documental about Woodstock. All I have to say, is I wish I was there at that time. I could sense the atmosphere and universal power behind it. I smiled, took deep breath and was left with the awe in my heart. <BR>
<BR>
One thing, that I don't understand at this point, is that I wasn't aware of visuals. Or more likely, they had no meaning and pervious feeling about content was gone. It was more mental trip. I know that visuals were intense still, but I didn't 'saw' them. I played with my thought or more precisely, 2C-E was playing with my thoughts.<BR>
<BR>
Rest of the experience was spent listening music and thinging about many things. Smoked two bongs and went to balcony to smoke a ciggs couple of times. Around T+8,5h/05:05AM, I went to sleep. I was still tripping hard and was +2 on shulgin scale. But considering the state I was in before, it felt more of +1. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
conclusion..<BR>
Thous, who still think that 2C-E is lightweight, then I don't know. Maybe you haven't had break throught dose or wasn't set or setting right. And thous, who think that 2C-E (phenethylamines in general) are 'clear-headed', you are completely wrong. they can be ego shattering like tryptamines. At least I've heard some refer to phenethylamines as 'clear-headed'.<BR>
<BR>
2C-E is intense, serious, deep, very visual, mentally challenging if dose are right and can hit you in DPT manner. As you can see, I consider 2C-E supreme psychedelic.<!--   End Body   -->

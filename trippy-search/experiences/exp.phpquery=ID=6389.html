I just returned from a 10-day trip to Europe for school.  While in Austria, I found a head shop on a street corner.  I went inside and asked what they had.  The guy said all they had was Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds.  So, I decided to buy 3 bags for 300 austrian schillings.  Each bag contained 10 seeds. <BR>
<BR>
Later that day, I took 6 before dinner.  About 30 mins into the meal, I became dizzy and nauseated.  I went to my room to lay down and relax.  I eventually felt better and noticed some effects close to those of LSD.  I started to feel warm and tingly and happy.  I went back up to the dining room and finished my dinner.  My girlfriend and our other friends decided that we would play poker as we did the night before.  I am pretty good at poker, but that night I was awful.  I couldn't think straight. I was anxiously waiting for visuals.<BR>
<BR>
After about an hour and a half, it became hard to see striaght and look at people in the eyes.  It felt like everyone knew i was on something.  I went to the bathroom to calm down and looked at myself in the mirror.  My eyes were blood-red and my pupils were the size of quarters.  I was feeling good, but i was also nervous at the same time.  After I sat down, I decided to quit playing.  I closed my eyes and started seeing fractals and rainbow like visuals.  I would close my eyes and see myself going down a long spinning rainbow colored tunnel. Everyone's faces were molding into wierd grotesque shapes.  People's glasses had one lense which was bigger than the other. Doorways were small then big.  It was nuts.<BR>
<BR>
It eventually got to the point that I couldnt be around people anymore.(this was about 3 hours after i took the seeds)  I got an elevator and before the doors shut, two chaperones jumped in.  They said 'man its hard to get an elevator here'.  I felt cornered and like they knew.  I said 'geez, I dont feel good at all.  I took some dramamine and I have a headache and my eyes dont look normal.'  They told me to get some rest.  I got off on my floor and into my room.  I was so scared that they knew.  I told my two room mates about how I didnt feel well and how I thought that the chaperones thought I was drunk.  They laughed and said for me not to worry.  I got into bed and one of the chaperonesknocked on the door to do a room-check.  He said if I need anything for them to come get him.  I was overwhelmed with joy that I had nothing to worry about.<BR>
<BR>
I closed my eyes and fell back into that same tunnel.  After they turned out the lights, I opened my eyes and watched TV.  It was crazy. The people on the TV were going 200 times faster than they really were.  I was seeing trails like crazy.  Everything looked fake and like everything had a colorful sheet of clear tinfoil on it.  My head was filling with anxiety.  I couldnt perceive myself as I normally did.  I didnt know if I was breathing or not. I had to relax my mind to make sure I was breathing. I had to think happy thoughts so i wouldnt go insane. I was to the point of screaming 'take me to a hospital!!!!!' but I didnt. I couldnt let it take me.  It was a drug in my body. It was MY body, not the seeds' body.  <BR>
<BR>
I eventually calmed down and realized I was in europe and I was tripping balls. I became happy. I thought about my girlfriend and how I feel about her.  I had a sudden feeling of relaxation and euphoria.  I had a smile on my face and I was seeing rainbow colored plus signs on everything.  I was feeling good, but I also needed some sleep.  I couldnt fall asleep. I felt feverish and thirsty as hell. I went to the bathroom to piss and drink some water. I looked in the mirror and everything was out of proportion.  My body's movements were all trails that looked like rainbows.  I went back to bed and fell asleep.<BR>
<BR>
The next day we had a 3-hour walking tour in the freezing austrian rain.  This was the worst hangover ever. I was freezing and nauseated. Later that day I ate a piece of cake and had some oil-like coffee.  I warmed up and felt really good.<BR>
<BR>
My advice to anyone who wants to take these seeds is to do it when you are in a comfortable place, preferably where not a lot of people are.  Also make sure that the day after you get a superfluous amount of sleep.  That was the most intense drug I have ever taken.  The first time I tripped on LSD I took 2 black gel tabs-it can't compare to those 6 seeds I took.<!--   End Body   -->

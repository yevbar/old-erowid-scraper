<br>
Background info: I acquired a pack of legal party pills 'Bloom' which I have since identified as containing mainly MDPV, through various reports online and also the comparison of effects felt. I did *not* realize they contained MDPV until after my high. My past drug experience includes cannabis, caffeine, nicotine, MDMA, LSD, mephedrone, methcathinone and cocaine. I am not on any medications.<br>
___<br>
<br>
I head out to a rave at a beach with a friend, let’s call him J. The day before we had both done about 200mg MDMA each, and not wanting to be using MDMA again, we arm ourselves with these legal pills. The package stated 1 per person, but my friend had taken 2.5 in the past and felt fine, so we decide to bring 5 pills total to the party. <br>
<br>
After a 2 hour ride to the rave, we arrive at our destination. The environment feels safe and I am in a positive state of mind, as I’m really looking forward to listening to the main DJ of the night. We sit around waiting and roll 5 heavy joints. At 3:45 AM the DJ we are expecting comes on stage to setup his equipment and we both drop 1 pill each. At this point I don’t know what to expect, as my friend wasn’t very detailed in explaining to me his previous experience with these pills, and guys in the shop just say it’s close to MDMA but with a little “feel” of cocaine to it.<br>
<br>
Some 45m later I am beginning to feel stimulated, and take my jacket off. Standing right in front of the stage being flashed with lights doesn’t bother me much. I dance effortlessly, barefoot in the sand. By now I’m feeling very awake but there’s not any mind-blowing euphoria, so we light up a joint to try and bring a “trippier” side to the high. Smoking definitely feels nice, and adds a “spacier” feel to the experience. At about T+1 we decide to do another half pill each (4:45 AM) and it soon hits me. I am feeling very, very speedy and I start to get a bit anxious the DJ will end his set soon (I now realize it was the drug talking, I didn’t realize that at the time). <br>
<br>
He has to reassure me twice that he’ll keep on playing for some more time, and judging by his reaction I must have looked a bit panicky. Definitely rushing hard hard now, and experiencing jaw clenching. It doesn’t bother me as long as I keep on dancing. There is some euphoria, but not the loved up MDMA kind. I talk to a couple of strangers that come up to me and socializing feels good, I feel that if I didn’t like the music so much I’d be happy just chatting away. <br>
<br>
At T+1:45 I and J do yet another half (and we have been smoking away on joints and cigarettes). Oh shit, this is where it starts getting hard. The music stops at more or less T+2:30 and as soon as I stop dancing… I feel it. The extreme anxiety and difficulty breathing. My heart is pounding away and I’m scared. I’m not used to this, it reminds me a lot of cocaine anxiety and I do not usually enjoy cocaine, I’m more of an MDMA person… I’ve done some pretty high (and stupid) pure MDMA doses in the past, of up to 900mg over 6 hours and NEVER felt as bad as I felt with these pills.<br>
<br>
I stand against the fence and try to calm me down, breathing deeply, but I realize it’s not going to go away. I try to figure out if there’s any tightness or pain in my chest, but I don’t feel anything wrong, so I realize it’s ok for now and I should try to function normally. As we leave the beach I try to talk and it’s hard not to do it overly fast and incoherently. My friend is definitely not feeling as intoxicated as I am (doesn’t surprise me as he’s much heavier than me), especially all the anxiety. We get in the car and J is driving back (yes, one shouldn’t drive while intoxicated, bad decision). <FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</FONT> <br>
<br>
By now it’s 7AM and I’m still really, really wired. It feels like I’ve done a shitload of coke but without the euphoria. All I want to do for the first hour of the ride is smoke cigarettes and focus on breathing… I’m still clenching my jaw so there’s not much desire to speak, except for checking on J. I am sweating profusely, my hands are constantly soaked. Then in the 2nd hour something changes and I feel the desire to talk. Not anything meaningful, just talking shit… laughing about and telling my friend I don’t want to go home, that we have to find another party, and then nonsense ramblings come on. I am feeling almighty but I know I’m “fucked” – and that’s the reason I don’t want to go home and face comedown alone.<br>
<br>
At 8ish AM I finally get home and I know I’m not going to get any sleep. I empty my bladder and go to bed. Absolutely no desire to eat or drink although I feel hungry. I get online and try to pass the time (this is when I research the pills and realize it’s MDPV), then at 11AM I decide to force myself to sleep. I don’t know if what followed was resting sleep or not, I woke up again one and a half hours later still feeling hyper. My heart had slowed down by now but I was still feeling anxious. I eat a slice of pizza and drink some juice, then proceed to kill more time online. At 8PM I begin to feel slightly sleepy and decide this’d be a good time to try and drift off to sleep. I sleep until 11PM and wake up feeling better. Eat and drink some more, kill more time.<br>
<br>
It has now been 24hrs since I dropped the first pill, and as I sit here writing this report I finally feel tired. Mentally and physically tired. <br>
<br>
My conclusion of this experience:  Right now, I’m feeling very negative towards this substance. I have probably overdone it, and maybe just 1 pill would be enough for some “extra energy” when wanting to dance all night, but I’m not sure if I’ll do it again.<!--   End Body   -->

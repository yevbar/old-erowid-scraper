<br>
Christmas day started off like every other Christmas, younger sibling eager to open his presents, and me eager to sleep in after a late night helping my parents rap gifts. Christmas continues as usual, opening gifts till about 12:00 then eating brunch and making plans for tomorrow with friends. It's 6:00pm and all family that is expected to come has arrived and I find myself excessively tired so I call my friend and ask her if I could purchase 7 ritalins for $4.00. She agrees. I meet up with my friend about 7:15 and purchase the product and indulge in small talk over a smoke.<br>
<br>
As soon as I get home I crush one up and insufflate it in one line up into my left sinus, instantly I feel more awake and talkative I join my family for dinner at around 7:30pm, appetite lost, I ate very little and felt sorta sick. After dinner I proceed to my garage for a quick bowl to ease my stomach discomfort. After the bowl I feel very enlightened and energetic. I go inside the house and we begin to open presents from the relatives.<br>
<br>
I go to my bedroom putting gifts away and crush up 2 more ritalin and sniff them in 1 line up into my left nostril. Instantly I can taste the ritalin and have trouble breathing, I grab a glass of water and quikly chug it down. Instant relief of dry throat. I can feel the methylphenidate in my brain, sorta like a warming sensation, and I am increasingly talkative with a friend of the family's and enjoy a 25 minute conversation with him, then we walk outside for a little joint.<br>
<br>
As I haul on the joint I feel a slight euphoria, and the need to be increasingly talkative. I enter my room and grab the remaining 4 ritalins and proceed to crush them with the mortar and pestle. When there is nothing but fine blue powder I make up 2 massive lines both containing 2 pills of ritalin each, 20mg of methylphenidate per line, me and my friend quickly insufflate the lines in 1 quick sweep and return to being talkative and over-enthusiastic about things.<br>
<br>
After about 15 mins I begin to get the craving for another so I call up my person and ask if she would sell me 15 for $10.00, she quickly agrees and I arrive at her house within 10 mins. I notice a slight shake in my hands and my jaw is chewing like I have gum in my mouth, but I don't! I quickly have a smoke and say goodbye. When I arrive home the first thing my friend asks is if he can trade 3 5mg valiums for 2 ritalins and I agree. After we insufflate 2 1/2 more ritalins each we quickly begin discussing common subjects, Christmas, family, jobs, girlfriends, etc. I notice my friends jaw is grinding like a m*th*rf*ck*r and decide to grab some water for both of us. <br>
<br>
It's about 10:30 and my family is chillin in the livingroom chatting about life. My friend quickly asks if he can spot some off me and I assure him it is no problem at all. We quickly insufflate 2 1/2 ritalins each and the high suddenly changes. I become much more happy and it is starting to imitate a cocaine high but not as happy. I was also very paranoid about getting caught. I continue talking and decide to go outside for a quick pipe bowl. After the first haul I feel much more relaxed but at the same time energetic and increasingly aware.<br>
<br>
It's around 12:00am and my friend departs home but not without railing another massive load of ritalin. We both sniff about 2 pills and then he leaves to go home. I sit and ponder what I am gonna do today, Christmas day is over. After about 10 mins I decide to go for 3 more Ritalin and spend a great deal more care crushing it up this time, as if I were perfecting the grain or something. I quickly make 2 lines and sniff 1 up each side and sit back on my bed. I am hearing music but my CD player isn't on. I have had this before, it is caused by sleep deprivation and the ritalin in combination.<br>
<br>
I decide to turn on the radio and play some James Bond Goldeneye on N64, (my playstation was stolen about a month ago :( ) As I continue to play I get so into the game that I don't realize an hour has passed and it's 1:30am.<br>
I am starting to feel tired so I sniff 2 more ritalins and eat 2. I sit in my bed and ponder for about 2 hours about life and other things, during this time I had about 3 ritalins insufflated. I go into my garage for a pipe bowl of cannabis and drift to sleep for about 15 mins. When I wake up I have a major craving for ritalin and it is causing me to feel depressed and paranoid. I go inside and quickly grind up half a pill, I have noticed my stomach is not taking kindly to the abuse so I lower the dosage, I quickly sniff it up and return to my happy self.<br>
<br>
About 1/2 hour later I finish the other half and eat one more It is now 6:30am and yet I crave another Blue Baby. I mash another one up and put it up my nose with a swift sniff. I feel fatigued but energetic, and I notice that my body/muscles are tired but my brain is fully awake and alert. But I am hearing things: music, people talking, and what sounds like a low humming. It's 7:15am and I did 1 about 5 mins ago, the whole family is asleep and yet I still think I hear ppl coming towards my room.<br>
<br>
Final Entry: It's 8:00am Sunday, members of my family have awoke and I am VERY PARANOID!! I am going to do 2 more now and I still have 15 left. I hope I can resist the craving and get some sleep. Thinking about taking Valium to relax muscles and get some sleep.<br>
<br>
If you are thinking of doing a lot of ritalin in a night consider little portions and more time in between. I blew my nose a minute ago and the tissue had blood drops and was tinted blue. My nose is not in any pain? Which I don't understand! Hopefully when I wake up it doesn't hurt! I can't stop chewing even if I try, it's very annoying and painful to my jaw muscle.<!--   End Body   -->

When I was younger I used to take 2 liter bottles from our recycle bag in our kitchen and breath in and out of them a few breaths and I would always feel light headed. I didn't really think I was doing any sort of drug, I just occasionally did it. About a month ago I had a two liter coke in my room, with about 2 inches of soda left. I had remembered what I did when I was young so I decided to try it again. I shook the bottle a little, opening it, bit the threaded lid, put my lips around it, and started breathing. I took very large deep breaths at first. I couldn't do so long. I would run out of any air soon. After about 5 hard deep breathes, I inhaled my last breath and dropped the bottle. I tried to get onto a spinning desk chair I have so I could spin and get dizzy. Before I could get to the chair, I collapsed onto the floor. I feel to my knees and let the breath go.<BR>
<BR>
I began to nearly black out. My vision became blurry, and shrunk. Everything around my was getting hit by what looked like blue lighting bolts. I was listening to music and what had to be one of the weirdest things was that the music sounded like it was melting. I sounded like a machine. Like metal. Like it was one fire. Everything around me became so blurry it looked like it was flying at me. I had to dodge them. I got up and ran to bed a few steps away. I hit my bed and stumbled to my chair, and fell to the ground. I realized the only way I wouldn't die was to call for help, I got up and as I did so the effects began to fade. I got up and sat down and before too long I was back to normal with only a light headed feeling.<BR>
<BR>
My trip was so intense I stands out in my mind. I won't ever forget it. I have a friend that tried it after I told him and it didn't work too well for him. I know I am a very light weight. That might effect it? Any how I have done N2O and huffed Dust Off. I had the mental blacking out of Dust Off, but the full blown body effects of a very strong, intense Nitrous Oxide High.<!--   End Body   -->

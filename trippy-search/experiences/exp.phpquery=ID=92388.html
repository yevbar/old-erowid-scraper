<br>
After trying it and realizing its the real deal it does what I want it to do 'bath salts' alter my state of mind and has a pretty large physical affect. I did a little research beforehand but was kind of a disbeliever so I just bought the shit and tried a 'safe' amount based on what I knew and previous drug experience, especially previous research chemical experience! AND the still unknown to me manufacturer's recommended dosage per bath of 50 mg. <br>
<br>
Basically I’m nowhere near new to drugs or even synthetic or fake or designer drugs wtf ever you wanna call them but this is my first time using any kind of bath salts MDPV or mephedrone what ever is in this particular brand. But any way I have a good amount of experiences with a couple of the 2c's either insufflating or just ingesting them and I wanna say in my opinion snorting this felt very similar to snorting 2c-i or any of the other 2c's I've tried but it wasn't quiet as intense as the 2c's but it had the familiar holy shit fuck my nose throat and even my eyes burn like crazy and it feels like a large part of my face and sinuses are swelling up kind of feeling it was somewhere between that and taking a first line of meth kind of hurting and snorting a capsule of 2c-I. But yea this shit doesnt feel good to snort but the good news is the first ones the worst it kind of evens out to doing a good sized line of meth afterwards in my personal opinion. <br>
<br>
But to continue on with my back story or whatnot I’ve done plenty of all of your standard illegal narcotics with the exception of heroin I wont take it that far I feel that once I do heroin or just stick a needle in my self to get high no matter what I'm banging that its pretty much over and there is nothing after that but a shitty life even if I recover from my now imminent permanent addiction. And I believe setting a limit will help with self control when it comes to doing drugs. I've seen a few friends who didn’t care at all about how they did drugs or what drugs they took and when they took them lose their shit and end up in some pretty bad spots. I'm not a goody two shoes either I have let it get to far more than once before especially with my first real “hard” drug I did good old cocaine but I always had some sort of limit set and I’m not saying I didn’t go over it a few times but just having it there was a good way to check myself and take a look at what was going on and be able to say I told myself I wasn’t going to take it this far and pull it back a bit until about after a year and a half of being a full on coke head (if I wasn’t at work I was high on coke). <br>
<br>
I even broke that limit a couple of times showing up to work coming down hard shit pouring out of my nose and I had to go through airport security every time it was time to go to work so yea I was being kinda dumb about it. But what ever I stopped all coke for a couple of years solid before I did another line and got that shit in check, and havent had too much of a problem with taking any other drug to that extent. I usually just binge on a bunch of different shit for a few days now and that holds me over for a long while before I start feeling like I need to just say fuck this bull shit and get fucked up again. <br>
<br>
Which brings me to now and this point in my life and also I’m done preaching about shit I think. Recently I have taken a new job and have no time off of work to mess with drugs literally the average weekend is an exact 24 hrs off of work on Sunday then back at it so my drug use has gone from occasional recreational use you know smoke some shit snort some thing maybe get lucky and roll at a rave or get some sort of psychedelic and have a great weekend every few months, to non exsistant with even more random and strict drug test and policies that I used to have so I’ve tried fucking LSA and synth weed and piperazine and that type of shit before in the past but never the “newest hardest most bestest shit around” yet that being bath salts. SO I found a place that sold some and waited till Friday night on a rare two whole day weekend and tried it and this is my experience with Rave on bath salts. so this is finally my best recollection of the last 11 or so hours of my life and my thoughts on MDPV in (perticuler)???? Totally just forgot how to spell that still no idea this shit does mess with my dome a bit). <Particular HA> maybe idk <br>
<br>
Around 8pm I got home from work settle in from a pretty irratating day but on the way home I finally decided to pick some of this stuff up and give it a shot so I was in a better than average mood. Think I took my first bit at around 8 -8 15 I'd say pretty much as soon as I got home and away from my room mate who I am hiding this from considering he is a pretty average white Texas boy who just recently graduated from a well known college and works for the same soul sucking company I do and has a respectable degree and job title. Which is also how I try to appear just without the degree but I do hold a fairly decent job title . (for a 23 year old who barely even gave college a shot before deciding it wasn’t for me) I’m pretty sure he hasn’t even tried ciggarettes he is that kind of kid. But anywho he had his gf and another friend over and I was a little bit nervous about trying something new around them but I just hid out by my self all night. Also we mostly got a place together for convienance rather than friendship so it was a bit awkward deciding wether or not to do something for the first time around pretty much strangers. <br>
<br>
SO the first line I took was close to 75mg about a third to a quarter of a 250 mg baggie which is about 25 mg more than the recommended dosage (per bath) so what ever I felt safe with it and it turned out to be a good amount it got me high and I feel like if I start with a really small amount I wont get a good first impression of it because of the amount of pain that comes along with the first sniff but it does get easier! Also note I didn’t measure any of this out I just put a straw in the bag and inhaled what I felt comfortable with for the first line. Other than immediate pain it takes about what feels like 5-10 minutes to hit me enough to let the pain kinda slip to the back of my mind and the first thought I had was yea its like snorting coke but that quickly went away maybe my brain was just trying to figure out what was going on and defaulted to a familiar sensation idk but it didn’t last long. It kind of changed from the initial rush feeling of coke to a anxious I’m about to roll balls feeling but the roll never came and the butterflies left my stomach and I had to go to the bathroom which is a similarity to coke. <br>
<br>
So by the time I got up to go to the restroom I had decided I'd spend the first bit of being high hiding out taking an extra long shower which most of the time I spent sitting just mindlessly playing with my phone and texting a couple of people non stop to stop the desire to talk to my roommate and by the time I had finished using the restroom the drug kind of had a methy feeling where I was steadily high and felt no sign of come down and really horny but with this stuff I couldn’t even get my shit to budge. I think it was for two main reasons the first was it definitely fucked up my blood pressure it feels like I just smoked shards for a couple of days and finally passed out and woke up with all of my extremities numb and tingly and this started right away almost and has lasted the whole night the second reason I think I couldn’t focus long enough to get aroused let alone stay hard. (but damn it felt and still kinda feels like if I can manage to cum it will feel like letting out poison or somthing) but by the time I was done trying to jerk off in the shower which btw was a luke warm shower not a hot shower getting in a hot shower on drugs can really fuck you up incase you didn’t know. It feels good for a while but then it starts to feel like your seriously about to have a heart attack so don’t be an idiot and do uppers and get in a hot ass shower especially with ecstacy that could really kill you quick. <br>
<br>
But by the time I had gotten out of the bathroom I was still feeling pretty much the same and it stayed that way for a good 2 or 3 hours before I got a little bit of a come down sensation at which point I spent a few hours doing tiny bumps cuz I didn’t want to try another big one for fear of the pretty gnarly pain that it brings. But finally I sacked up and did another good sized bump about to size of an average button and it was piled up about a ¼ of an inch which in comparison to the first line is tiny it still had a pretty good punch to it much better than the little specs of bumps I had been doing with little to no effect. SO about 5 hours in I'd done about half the bag (125 mg or so) and havent done any more since then and its now been almost 12 hours since I started and I’m still pretty high. <br>
<br>
Thoughts about this drug<br>
Its worth the money and is an adequate substitution for real drugs most recognizable feeling is that of meth I'd say. I probly wont do the rest of this bag for almost a month though it did an alright job but idk how I feel about it all the way yet I need to come down off of it first to be able to judge how often I feel comfortable using it with out it becoming a habit in any way.<!--   End Body   -->

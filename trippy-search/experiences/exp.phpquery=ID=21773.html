I recently procured a sample of 5-MeO-DMT.  My friends and I were very excited to give this a try.  We had done ayahuasca together a few times and had thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Our typical ayahuasca experience had evolved to about 4g of syrian rue followed by over 20g of mimosa hostilis.  So we naturally assumed that we could cope with 5-MeO-DMT.<BR>
<BR>
We decided that we would first start by potentiating things with 3g of syrian rue each so that our experience would be as much like ayahuasca as possible.  After waiting an hour we decide to go ahead and take the 5-MeO-DMT.  At first we attempted to smoke it, but that proved to be overly complicated in our already mildly inebriated state.  So instead we insufflated it.  My two female friends (approx 50-55kg each) took 10mg.  My male friend (approx 115kg) took 16mg, and I (approx 100kg) took 18mg.  <BR>
<BR>
Within three minutes the experience began.  The last rational thought I remember having was: 'My God! I did something to make this last longer!'  The last thing I remember period is needing to vomit, but not being able to remember where my mouth and throat were.  From what I can piece together, I spent the next two hours completely dissociated from reality in a state of absolute terror.  At some point I heard in the distance: '*** it's okay, you're going to be fine' repeated over and over again.  With time, I realized that this was one of my female friends who had come out of the void before I did.  Gradually the fear subsided into an ayahuasca-like state, complete with visual hallucinations, only with much darker undertones than what I would experience with ayahuasca.<BR>
<BR>
By four hours after the ingestion of the 5-MeO-DMT, I was in a normal enough state that I went for a walk outside.  I was still experiencing residual visual hallucinations even at that point.  At six hours, I finally fell asleep with my eyes still open (I have always been able to sleep with my eyes open) watching Fox News Network.  That was a mistake because the next day my mind was filled with extremely vivid imagery of myself and those I love dying from weapons of mass destruction.  (Michael Moore was right when he said in 'Bowling for Columbine' that the primary function of the American news networks was to scare the shit out of us.)<BR>
<BR>
The next day, things were definitely not fine.  At work (I'm a graduate student researcher) I spent several hours staring blankly at my computer screen.  I experienced profound time contraction: hours seemed like minutes.  The only productive thing I was able to do was to chat online with the female friend who had pulled me out of  5-MeO-DMT void the night before.  (God, I love her for that!)  That evening I started to suffer from the delusion that I was still in the 5-MeO-DMT experience, that I was on the verge of death in a puddle of my own puke back at my friends' apartment and that everything that was happening around me was entirely in my head.  This was a very unsettling thought.<BR>
<BR>
During the course of the second night I had a very profound shamanistic dream.  I awoke in the morning feeling like myself again and with the smell of some sort of herbal smoke in my nose.  Even now, I'm not sure what to make of this, but at least I'm better.<BR>
<BR>
The reason I am submitting this report is as a warning to those who might be curious about 5-MeO-DMT.  It is not the same as DMT.  I don't think any amount of ayahuasca can prepare you for the 5-huasca experience.  I have since tried 5-MeO-DMT by itselt and it really wasn't all that scary.  However the sheer duration and the increased intensity of the 5-huasca experience is such that one should be thoroughly familiar with very intense doses of 5-MeO-DMT by itself before attempting the admixture.<!--   End Body   -->

My parents had gone to our beach house for the weekend.  Knowing that my empty house would be the most comfortable place to trip, I called my friend and we both decided to trip on mushrooms that night.  <BR>
<BR>
Well, obtaining the mushrooms proved more difficult that previously thought.  My contact had a surprise visit from his marine recruiter, and ended up spending the whole day at a seminar for the marines.  He finally arrived home at 8:00.  By this time it was too late to travel to the city to get the shrooms.  <BR>
<BR>
Not wanting the golden opportunity to go to waste, I remembered the bag of HBWS I had in a drawer.  I am an experienced tripper, having done MJ, mushrooms and DXM many times, and smoking salvia 10x a bunch.  I had only done HBWS once before and found the effects to compare to a mild body trip.  But the dosage was fairly low and the preparation was sloppy.  I vowed to myself that the next time I would do more research and be more precise.  <BR>
<BR>
I accepted the fact that the holy mushroom was not going to be my companion for the night, and began preparing the seeds.  I was going to do a cold-water extraction. I started around 5:00.  I took 30 of the seeds (which had been purchased over the internet) and removed all the fuzzy, white coating. The white stuff is supposedly the main cause of nausea.  <BR>
<BR>
After doing this I took all the seeds and placed them in a plastic bag. Then I took the bag out to the garage, (making sure not to let my sister see, she was still home at the time) and placed them on the ground.  It is important to use a solid base.  I ground the seeds up by smashing them with a hammer.  After they were of a powdery form I put the seeds in a 24 fl. oz sport bottle.  Then I shook up the Cold water and the seeds, and placed them in the fridge.  <BR>
<BR>
3 hours later, my sister had left and my friend was at my house. The clear water had now turned a greenish-brown.  I knew this was a good sign.  Then I proceeded to take 3 Yohimbe Extract Pills, and a Vitamin C.  I took the Pills because I usually take Yohimbe with substances because it it a mild MAOI and is also somewhat stimulating.  My friend did the same.  We emptied the sports bottle into two cups and drank the concoction, seeds and all. The taste resembled bark, and we left the larger seed chunks in the cup.  <BR>
<BR>
8:35<BR>
About five minutes after drinking the seeds both our legs began to feel 'floaty'.  Very much like on mushrooms.  Though it wasn't as intense.  We also both began to feel mildly drunk.  This passed though.  After sitting around for a bit we decided to go for a ride.  My friend drove.  We were listening to Rusted Root's CD 'When I Woke'.  We went to a local movie theater.  When we arrived I began to feel this strange complacency, like I was supposed to stay in the car and explore this situation.  By this time I was feeling slight nausea, even though I had taken two dramamine. Listening to the CD was incredible, the music began to flow through us and it came through like an amazing journey.  <BR>
<BR>
9:00<BR>
As we were sitting in the car I began to rub my legs.  Wherever I touched my leg, my leg began to get incredibly warm.  Rubbing was intense and pleasurable. Not in a sexual way but in a relaxing way.  <BR>
<BR>
9:15<BR>
We then left the vehicle and went inside.  While inside all the noise was grouped and it seemed like a million voices were all carrying on conversations at once.  After five minutes we realized that the car was where we were intended to be.  And while I was standing the nausea was very intense.  So we went back in the car and picked up where we left off.<BR>
<BR>
9:30<BR>
Then we drove to my house and sat in my driveway.  For the rest of the trip the setting is in my living room.  Lights are off. Music on this substance is definitely enhanced. Suddenly I had an urge to lie on the floor.  So we went in my house and played the CD in my living room in surround sound.  The intensity was unbelievable.  There were no visuals but the most amazing thing happened.  My friend and I both connected on a totally different emotional plane.  I felt so connected to not only him but the world in general. The thought processes were incredible, they were clear and vibrant.  Fully believing that I was controlling the universe.<BR>
<BR>
10:30<BR>
Then I took out some fruit and the taste was unbelievable.  I felt as if I was consuming my own life force because I had come from the earth, and was a part of the earth.  The fruit tasted so real.  Taste was really enhanced.<BR>
<BR>
By this time I had lost total control of time, what had been 3 hours felt like 8.  At around 11:00 my girlfriend called and that shot me back to reality.  My friend and I began disecting what had happened.  We came to so many spiritual revelations.  <BR>
<BR>
At 11:30 I called her back and felt a serious melancholy set in when I could not reach her.  When I finally did I felt a major warmth surge through my entire body.  My friend and I then had our girlfriends come over.  My friend left and my GF stayed over.  Sex was not on my mind.  Not only because I was still nauseous but because just being close to her was more than enough.  Though at its peak I believe this would be a sex enhancer.  At around 12:30 I was experiencing mostly after effects.  I had a great sleep and woke up refreshed.<BR>
<BR>
I strongly urge anyone who has experience with pychedelics to try this.  It is not a visual trip, like acid or shrooms.  But it is just as worth it, maybe more so. Definitely start with a very low dosage.  No more than 10. After the strength is determined then you can up it.  The right setting will allow you to go on an incredible journey that may change your life.  It is not a recreational drug. You control the trip. You Decide how far you go. This is why it is so amazing. I eagerly anticipate my next LSA adventure.<!--   End Body   -->

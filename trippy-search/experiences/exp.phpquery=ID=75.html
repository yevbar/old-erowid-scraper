Let me preface this posting with this:  I am not a chemist, I took chemistry in high school and for a short stint in college.  I would like to believe I used a reasonably scientific method for my testing and would encourage the same of anyone else who tries anything of this nature.  Of course I post these results only as a detailed informational guide for anyone who is interested in attempting this legal (as far as I know) extraction process.  <BR>
<BR>
11/16/99<BR>
(SOURCE)<BR>
FAMILY : Convolvulaceae <BR>
GENUS : Ipomoea  <BR>
SPECIES : violacea <BR>
LSA extraction into Ethonal base (190proof Everclear)<BR>
-----------------------------------------------------------<BR>
5:40PM  Ground 378 seeds to powder<BR>
<BR>
5:45PM  Placed powder into 296ml of Naptha / shook solution vigorously<BR>
<BR>
5:50PM  Set aside MG powder in Naptha bath (~20min)<BR>
<BR>
6:12PM  Began filtration process through coffee filter NOTE: very slow<BR>
<BR>
6:34PM  Still filtering, process is extremely slow, down to large pieces now<BR>
<BR>
6:49PM  The extraction process is complete, sandlike seed remains placed directly under 40watt bulb (Desk lamp 2-3' from substance) on several layers of thick paper towel<BR>
<BR>
NOTE:	The sticky gum on masking tape is turned into a gooey substance by Naptha, remember not to use it again<BR>
<BR>
7:03PM 	Using a pocketknife, I cut/mixed the sand/powder substance to ensure even distribution, and that everything was dry before the alcohol bath<BR>
<BR>
NOTE:	VERY VERY Few of the people that tried extracting LSA from morning glory seeds that posted to the 'net actually followed the directions given in the FAQ.  Aside from the nausea elimiting step, almost all neglected the grind to a powder and soak in strong (read 190prf) alcohol to extract the LSA as it is soluable in an ethanol based liquid.  The closest thing to the aformentioned procedure,  was someone who decided to evaporate off some of the alcohol to rid it of an ether smell.  I can assume he evaporated off much of the LSA that was dissolved into the alcohol, as his results were poor at best.<BR>
<BR>
7:09PM	Substance (powder/sand mix) is completely dry, dumped onto sheet of paper and into glass jar w/1.5shots (approx 1.5oz) of Everclear 190prf grain alcohol.<BR>
<BR>
7:14PM	Solution placed in cool dark location for LSA extraction process<BR>
<BR>
11/17/99<BR>
2:48PM	Solution agitated<BR>
<BR>
4:10PM	Solution agitated<BR>
<BR>
11:14PM	Observations: Solution is in several layers, bottom layer consists of larger assumed heavier pieces of seed, middle layer is sediment like in nature (powder)with the top being the slightly yellowish tinged liquid.	Agitating solution<BR>
<BR>
11/18/99<BR>
3:00PM	Solution agitated<BR>
<BR>
11/19/99<BR>
5:46AM 	Solution agitated /observation: The clear solution above the sediment at the bottom of the jar appears to have a milky substance in it (pre agitation).<BR>
<BR>
6:32PM	Begin filtration process of final LSA enriched solution<BR>
<BR>
6:57PM	Solution processing complete.  It is a clear/yellowish color similar to weak lemonade.  A prior net posting stated it had a urine color to it.<BR>
<BR>
6:58PM	Recording heart rate: (42bm/30s) extrapolated to 84bpm<BR>
<BR>
7:00PM	Solution scent is very 'chemically' for lack of a better word.  Definitely doesn't smell the same as straight alcohol.  Not the naptha either, it is a unique smell Also, it seems to burn the nostrils if you inhale to deeply.<BR>
<BR>
7:10PM	After initial strength testing I have determined the solution too powerful for direct consumption, and that it *must* be cut with something in order to drink it. I have placed approx 1/3 of the solution into the last of the OJ in the house and I am attempting to drink it now.<BR>
	<BR>
NOTE: 	From the FAQ: 'if you sip a bit and hold it in your mouth before swallowing..' this is much easier said than done.  When was the last time you held a 190prf liquid in your mouth?  It's rather difficult.  When I was 18 I had few issues drinking everclear straight, I'm older and wiser now and know better than to try that.  (I also have a Foster's beer handy to chase any aftertaste, however I will attempt to refrain from using it in order to not cloud the LSA experience)<BR>
<BR>
FROMNET:From the Erowid vault on Morning Glory seed dosage levels:<BR>
	Ipomoea violacea Dosages <BR>
	------------------------<BR>
	Light 50-100 seeds 1.5-3 grams <BR>
	Medium 100-250 seeds 3-6 grams <BR>
	Strong 250-400 seeds 6-10 grams *<BR>
	Heavy 400+ 10+ grams <BR>
<BR>
*(The 378 I have sitting here falls into this cat.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
7:16PM	The first 1/3 of the solution has been ingested, no effects yet.  The FAQ proports near immediate effects if the solution is swished around in the mouth for a few moments, but this is inconcievable to me.  Also, that first 1/3 of 378 seeds falls into the lower end of a medium dosage, I will wait until 7:30PM if no effects, another 1/3 will be consumed.<BR>
<BR>
7:21PM	My face feels flushed and warm, checking in a mirror reveals a little extra color in my cheeks, of course this could just be the everclear. (some alcohols do this to me)<BR>
<BR>
7:31PM	No noteable effects to record, however walking downstairs in order to obtain something to cut the remaining solution with I thought I saw horizontal lines accross my field of vision, it didn't last long and I considered that I may be thinking myself high.<BR>
<BR>
NOTE:	Rasberry crystal light is all I can find, in a vain attempt to make it overpower the everclear, I cut the water down by 1/2.  We'll see.. :  Another note, although I've only taken 1/3 and its only been about 20 minutes, it is a bit of a letdown.  Although I didn't expect the walls to start breathing or anthing like that, I was hoping for *something*<BR>
<BR>
The rasberry crystal light is masking the flavor 20times better than the OJ did, but it still isn't 'easy' to drink.<BR>
<BR>
7:41PM	Finished consuming 2nd 1/3 portion of the solution, there is now approx 1/3 left waiting to be ingested.  Still no results from the inital 2/3s I have drank, which equates to roughly 252 seeds or 232ug (micrograms) of Lysergic Acid Amides which are 5-10% as potent as LSD (Lysergic Acid Diethylamide)<BR>
<BR>
7:45PM	Heartrate is: 41bp/30s extrapolated to 82bpm<BR>
<BR>
7:51PM	Sadly still no effects, reports I've read suggest about 45minutes, it has been almost that long.  I will give it one last shot and ingest the last 1/3 of the solution.  The only effects I have received are a mild flushing of the cheeks, a very mild headache (almost non-existant)and slightly upset stomach.  All of the aforementioned syptoms can be accounted for based on the everclear content of the drink, and the fact that I started with a completely empty stomach.  Mixing/drinking now.<BR>
<BR>
8:02PM	I went into the bathroom to turn out the light and looked in the mirror to see if I noticed anything.  I thought for a moment I saw something, a facial feature bend/distort, but I stayed there and continued to look but to no avail.  I don't feel terribly nautious, but I definitely feel as though I cannot finish the drink.  I drank about 1/2 of it so I did ingest most of what I need.<BR>
<BR>
8:18PM	Still no effects, I just got done cleaning up the liquid vomit that I was unable to control.  No orange coloring, all red, so I assume the first 1/3 was retained although I think I lost the last 3rd possibly some of the 2nd.  In either case, cleaning was not fun as I have tan carpets and 2xCrystal light is not fun to clean.  I'm rather upset about this	entire experiment, both the amount of effort that went into testing and at the lack of any effects of any kind at all.  <BR>
<BR>
~8:30-8:45PM<BR>
Fell asleep.  I must note that during sleep I had a very vivid dream that I was in a diner or something like that, and on acid with the full blown effects.  This dream was very likely influenced by the potion, however I cannot say how much I really ended up ingesting, since I threw up a reasonable portion of it.  If I was to 	ever attempt this again, I would have made the solution a *lot* more potent by adding much much less alcohol.  <BR>
<BR>
Conclusions:<BR>
Although I cannot be certain how much I actually retained, I can be certain that some very mild effects were noticed while concious, and while unconcious slightly more powerful effects were observed.  The times where I thought I hallucinated while concious were similar to the beginnings<BR>
of an acid trip, while the unconcious trip was much like a regular acid trip however it was entirely while asleep which to mean ruins the whole point of taking the drug in the first place.<BR>
<BR>
For me, I want to see wild and strange things that are not normal which I am lucid and concious, bizzare things happen in dreams without drugs anyway, so I'm not interested in those subconcious altered states.  I'm also into looking at plain things, rather than 'trippy posters' and 'acid toys'  I get off more on looking at a stick for 10 minutes before I am able to realize that's what I've been looking at. <BR>
<BR>
Will I do it again? Who knows... if I do there are certainly things I would change, and it may be worth it to see if a more refined process makes any difference.  Let me also note that I am not	refuting any of the prior postings, I am however simply posting what I did and what I went through.<BR>
<BR>
To me, it was a lot of effort, for little/no effect.  My next home experiment will be to attempt to grow psclicibin (sp?) mushrooms at home.<!--   End Body   -->

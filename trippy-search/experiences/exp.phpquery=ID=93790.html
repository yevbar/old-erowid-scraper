A friend, who I'll refer to as S, and I purchased 10 doses of 2C-C-NBOMe from a reliable source. When we obtained the chemical all 10 doses were mixed with 1 mL of water. The method of consumption that we used was a needle-less syringe allowing us to shoot/snort the 1/10 mL up our nostril.<br>
<br>
I arrived at S's house around 11PM and very soon after we took our doses (1 each because we were heavily advised to not exceed that amount). I was not expecting the burn and smell of the chemical; it smelled as if I just snorted ear drop solution (slightly alcoholic smelling). The burn went away after approximately 2 minutes, but throughout the night I would get the occasional whiff of the odor.<br>
<br>
S and I sat down on some chairs in the living room and had Jon Stewart on the TV. Withing 5 minutes we both agreed that we felt it coming on fast. After another 2 to 5 minutes we were definitely starting to trip. The politics on the TV, even though J. Stewart was trying to make it funny, were way too intense for me, so I asked S to turn off the TV.<br>
<br>
For the next who knows how long (our sense of time is completely warped already (approx. 10-15 minutes into the experience)), we sat in silence as the visuals began to become stronger and stronger.<br>
<br>
I've always considered myself fairly experienced with psychedelics because I've taken LSD at least 5 times, mushroom about 4 times, DMT at least 4 times, DXM at least 6 times, 2C-B twice, MDMA approximately 4 times, and of course somewhat regularly consumed marijuana. But as this trip was coming on fast and strong my friend and I both began to feel overwhelmed.<br>
<br>
The best way I can describe the visuals would to call everything in my vision 'light', whereas when sober my vision is 'heavy'. My vision being light allows the chemical to take control of my eyes much easier. Throughout the next two hours or so we put on some random music, sat in silence (we felt no need for communication as we were still getting used to the trip), and stared into space.<br>
<br>
My favorite things to stare at were the wooden paneled floor (the boards would converge, tilt, expand, etc), the ceiling (which we both agreed look like it was made of the skeletal structure of bat wings)... at one point the pattern on the ceiling turned into a marble carving of Satan holding humans in his hands (which wasn't frightening, but definitely interesting), and also the charcoal pictures on his wall that multiple friends had worked on (the multiple layers and different shadings in the pictures fluctuated so much).<br>
<br>
During the most intense portion of the trip I had a fairly noticeable body load (but not nearly as annoying as 2C-B). My mouth would end up feeling tight/somewhat numb for much of the trip. And my least favorite of all the physical side effects was that the region of my private area would occasionally become numb (which was the scariest part of the experience, probably). Also, it was very hard to determine if I had to piss and when I did it was difficult to know if I was entirely finished (or if I had even made most of it into the toilet).<br>
<br>
Eventually things began to mellow out after 3-4 hours. The visuals were still definitely there but not nearly as prominent. The entire night I had been wanting to go outside for a smoke, but never gathered the courage believing that it would make the trip even more overwhelming. But at this point in time I felt like I was capable, so we sat outside in the humid/chilly/rainy night and watched the super low clouds dart across the sky and I also enjoyed all of the city lights/car lights that I could see from where we were. We sat outside for maybe 15-20 minutes and I smoked 3 cigarettes; while outside neither of us could determine if it really wasn't cold or if it was our bodies playing tricks on us.<br>
<br>
With the trip slowly dwindling away we headed towards his computer. On his computer we watched every Symphony of Science video on youtube (they're inspiring whether intoxicated for not), then afterwards we listened to a lot of post-rock such as pg.lost and If These Trees Could Talk. During the songs we felt as if we code analyze the pictures the were on the youtube videos to the fullest.<br>
<br>
Feeling almost entirely done with the trip (I felt capable enough to drive, but I didn't because I'm not a fan of making stupid decisions) we went outside one last time for another smoke. Around 5:30AM we both headed to bed. It took me maybe 30 minutes to fall asleep, which isn't horrible; however, my friend said it took him about 2 hours. That night I did not have a deep sleep at all (I'm assuming because my mind was still very active from the drug), and I arose around 1PM still feeling fairly tired.<br>
<br>
The day after the trip I remain feeling somewhat tired and I've had a very very minor headache coming and going, but nothing intolerable.<br>
<br>
Now that I know (as well as possible, at least) what to expect, I would definitely do it again (and use my other doses). I found 2C-C-NBOMe to be a somewhat clear-minded, pretty visually active trip, and a good alternative if I don't have the 12 hours to drop acid.<br>
<br>
BE CAREFUL AND ENJOY!<!--   End Body   -->

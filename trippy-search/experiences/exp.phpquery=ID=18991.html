The real-life characters are: (1) The DJ, proposing marriage to his girlfriend, (2) The Girlfriend, knows nothing of the DJ's plan to propose; just thinks we're going to party in Vegas, (3) The Dealer, works for a casino in Vegas, gave us VIP to clubs and an awesome limo, (4) The DJ's Mom, his best friend and our party-pal, (4) me.<BR>
<BR>
In order to 'do it with style,' we bought 2 dosages of MDMA each, and brought 1 oz of marijuana across state lines (from AZ to NV).<BR>
<BR>
2100: We smoked about a quarter-oz of marijuana, then ate 1 pill each.  I ate 1 pill, then bit the 2nd pill in half. We also each had 1 litre of H2O and a bottle of Gatorade; the water is to stave the dehydration, and the gatorade to prevent hyponatremia.  We left the hotel, boarded the limo, and cruised the strip.<BR>
<BR>
2105: If you've never rolled before, within the first 10 minutes of orally ingesting the tabs, I experience the psychosomatic effect that I'm 'rushing' into my roll.  We each had 1 red pill and 1 blue pill (we love the film 'The Matrix' featuring pills of each color.)  The pills were not previously tested for MDxx content.<BR>
<BR>
2115:  I was now rushing in the limo.  The DJ spins trance by profession, so the limo was thumping the rapid rhythm, and my heart rate accelerated to keep up.  Along with the discotheque smoke and lighting, I was rushing hard.<BR>
<BR>
2145:  I was ROLLING!  I am completely unable to focus on any one thing or conversation for longer than 15 seconds, which makes the time go by so fast.  Right when I begin to plateau into my rolls, the DJ got down on his knees and proposed; she said 'YES!'  <BR>
<BR>
2200:  Sobriety checkpoint!  The limo driver was kewl, but told us if we had anything that we should have, we should probably dump it, because the cops like to snoop their noses into the sedans.  The guys ate their 2nd pills.  At this point, we've now ingested 2 tablets within a 1-hr interval.<BR>
<BR>
2215:  I felt as if I was going to die of a heart attack.  I'm 225 lbs, 6'1' and *very* strong (muy macho!) -- I drink and smoke and have at least 5 chemicals in my body at any point during a good weekend, but I felt scared; my mind was racing, and I thought my chest and head were going to explode because I was rushing so hard.  Never before had I felt this anxious on Ex!  My bruxism was at full bore, both fists were clenched tight, and my sewing-machine leg was pounding on the floorboard of the limo.  Both my H2O and gatorade were finished.  I said, 'We *need* to DANCE or my brain will explode all over you guys!'<BR>
<BR>
2230: We entered a club at a casino.  I think we posed for pictures of the newly-betrothed couple.  My hands were trembling intensely, so we immediatly hit the dance floor.  My perceptions were completely altered, and I became indiscreetly affectionate with 2 strangers.  Lapse of judgement!<BR>
<BR>
2330: After 1 hr at the club, none of us consumed any alcohol for fear of dehydration.  As soon as we re-entered the limo, the fiancee vomited into a trash receptacle.  She said she was fine, so we forwarded to the next club.<BR>
<BR>
2400:  Midnight!  I think we smoked weed in the limo, or somewhere.  I just know I got higher.  We were now at another club at another casino.  The *best* club to roll on ex!  I swear everyone I talked to said, 'yeah, we're rolling.'  I would hug 'em and say, 'Me too!'  Very indiscreet.<BR>
<BR>
0200: The group is coming down, so we all headed out of the club, going back to the hotel to smoke up some more.  The THC at the end of the roll gives us the 'going back up' effect, so we smoke about another quarter-oz.  I rolled 1 joint, jumped a cab, and went back to club.<BR>
<BR>
0400: By this time, my chest is still thumping, I've been hyperactive, anxious, and dancing for about 3 hrs non-stop.  I've also drank about 7 liters of water.  NO booze!  It seemed that each hours new hordes of clubbers were piling onto the dance floor.  The party didn't stop, which suited my roll very well.<BR>
<BR>
0600: It hit me like a ton of bricks.  'The Crash.'  While at the club, I felt very distressed, and began indiscriminately inquiring of other clubbers if they knew where I could score some more E.  I was unsuccessful, most were probably afraid that I was a cop or a narc.<BR>
<BR>
0745: We all agreed to meet back at the hotel room at 8:00 am to leave back to AZ.  But what hotel was the room at?  What was the name of the hotel???  Luckily, had the key in my pocket -- I pointed at it for the cabby, 'Take me to this hotel please.'  He laughed, and asked, 'You've been up all night?'  I said, 'There are pills you can take that will keep you up all night AND make you feel damn good too!'  He laughed nervously.<BR>
<BR>
0800: Everyone laughed as we trudged into the room, collapsing on a bed.  'You can't sleep, we've gotta check-out by 9am!'  Grabbing my duffle bag & personals, I headed for the door.  'Hey Joe, the car's not out there yet; wait up here in the room and we'll come back for ya.'  They all laughed and told me how horrible I looked.  Going to the mirror, I looked worn out, as if I hadn't slept in 3 days.  Pale, lividity under my eyes and cheekbones.  I looked tragically gothic!<BR>
<BR>
1000 and on:  the 7-hr drive back to AZ was TERRIBLE!  I was high and tweaking in the backseat, trying to sleep, grinding my teeth, and twitching my fingers and toes.  This was gonna be rough!  I smoke about another quarter-oz, bowl after bowl after bowl to try to level myself out.  The most restless sleep ever.<BR>
<BR>
I don't remember completely the ride home (black-outs in my memory), but I remember feeling gawd-awful the next day.<!--   End Body   -->

<!--   Start Body   -->


It was New Year’s Eve with a Full Moon and time for another mind challenge. My wife, myself, and her sister who we will call ”G” had planned a Party for the night. My wife, who I will call “S” started the Party early by taking about 1 and 1/2 large Nutmeg at around 9a.m. This way her Trip would be over sooner for her so she could work the next day. We like to stick with just chewing up the whole nut. The taste is nasty, but worth it. I took my dose of the same amount at around 3 p.m.  The idea was to time the Nutmeg with the Mushrooms so that the peaks would overlap. After several hours of making food for the party, we left for her sister’s house which was luckily only about four blocks away. We arrived at around 7p.m. and were enjoying the subtle effects.  Two people would be showing up soon that were not hip to the idea of any of us Tripping so that made it even more challenging.<br>
 <br>
G and I had agreed to each go the bathroom to take our pre-measured dose of Mushrooms of a gram right after dinner. So it would make the interesting combination of G on Mushrooms, S on Nutmeg, and me on both.  By the time dinner was done it was 9 p.m. Perfect timing. I glanced at G and went to take my dose. I than realized that I was feeling really good. I thought about how I was handling myself in front of the two non Trippers.  My sense of time had been altered. I could not remember what in the world we were talking about and only about three minutes had passed. So far, it seemed as though they thought I was just drunk. I had a hard time getting all the crumbs out of the bag. It felt good just to stand there in the bathroom and feel the pieces.<br>
<br>
Once I dosed, I went back out to talk to people. G went to take her dose. I sat down and started to talk with her husband. The shrooms seemed to kick in very quickly.  Her husbands arms were making tracers as he used them to explain a story. The tracers had cool fine webs attached to them. I was understanding everything said around me but every time I tried to talk, it would come out all slurred and would not make sense. S noticed that I was dragging my words out and saying things with a loooooonnng draw.  <br>
<br>
This was such an incredible feeling. I noticed G laughing really loud and hysterically. Her husband went to bed and things started to get even more intense. I was having no negative feelings from the Shrooms. The Nutmeg had absorbed all the negative of the Shrooms and the Shrooms absorbed all the negative of the Nutmeg. I decided that I was just going to sit in the same chair all night and enjoy the feeling.<br>
<br>
Every time I got up to go to the bathroom or to get another beer, the talking that I previously understood would totally morph into bla bla bla dro dlap dlap. Every time it was a little more distorted. If I looked directly at someone, I could tell what was being said. As soon as I turned away the distortion would start again. At first, I though S and G were playing with me and making their voices like that on purpose. I than realized that everyone’s voice was doing it. That was just one of the coolest things I have ever heard.<br>
<br>
There were several visual mind fucks. These were things like me thinking I saw a cat all curled up on the edge of the couch, and with a closer look turning into a shadow. Colors would change from dark to light and different shades would appear on various locations. I was having so much Fun, I almost forgot about midnight. We were 7 minutes away. G, S, and I convinced everyone to go outside. The cold did not really bother me. Gunfire and Firecrackers filled the air. They were a lot of happy people all around. The blasting noises echoed and left sound like tracers. I could not tell what would have normally been an echo. Someone a block away set off the really pretty sky lit kind. I just happened to look at the right time. The whole sky was brightened by the Full Moon.<br>
<br>
Things were still increasing for the Nutmeg. This was a little frightening, but I really enjoyed embracing the New Year in this frame of mind. S kept on opening the car door and honking the horn which also left cool echoes. Usually this sort of thing would make me paranoid as Hell. I just stood there in the cold and laughed. Once we went inside, things happened even faster.  I finally rested on the floor as I was listening to Phish. The music was talking to me from different angles and this was too interesting to leave. So I stayed on the floor for about an hour contemplating the melodies and tones. When I fell asleep, my Dreams were realistic and about the night. I Dreamed I was still awake at the Party. It was hard to tell in the morning what I Dreamed and what really happened.  <br>
<br>
It is now the next day and I am still feeling the nutmeg and having mild flash visuals of colors changing and shadows. The Nutmeg had an effect on the way the Mushrooms lasted. When I first woke up, I still felt the effects for around 15 minutes. These two drugs go very well together and can be very rewarding if done right. A larger dose of Shrooms would have worked, but this was a cautious start. I would recommend to anyone wanting to combine these to try each alone first to get used the power of each. The self practical joke playing Nature of the Nutmeg when combined with the Shrooms produces some very interesting “What is real?” questions.<!--   End Body   -->

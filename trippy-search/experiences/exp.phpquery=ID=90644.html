250mg of 4-HO-MPT was secured from an online retailer, my experience with Tryptamines is pretty vast and this one had been getting some very good reviews.<br>
<br>
30mg of 4-HO-MPT was put inside a gelcap, I chose to go with a higher dose then most of the experiences I've read because I'm usually a hard head when it comes to Tryptamines and I wanted the 'full experience'.<br>
<br>
[0:00] swallow gelcap and begin the waiting process, I expected to wait anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes.<br>
<br>
[0:06] Alert already? Can't be, chalk it up to placebo effect.<br>
<br>
[0:16] A calming feeling falls over me and I sense maybe a hint of stomach discomfort, so little it could have easily have been imagined. Nothing comes of it.<br>
<br>
[0:30] Definitely something now, I feel light headed and slightly anxious. There are hints of color changes like my previous experiences with 4-Aco-DMT, except instead of reds and golds it seems to be greens. I'm sitting at my laptop chatting to friends, which is still an easy task. I roll and light a joint to try and accelerate the coming effects.<br>
<br>
[0:46] The mental effects have begun, the joint I'm smoking is taking a very long time to smoke because I keep forgetting I'm smoking it and it keeps going out repeatedly in my hand or the ashtray. I feel a sense of overall well-being. Visuals start to creep up on me, shimmering on the sides of my visual field and a distinct shift in color to green.<br>
<br>
[0:55] Effects continue to increase and finally I manage to finish the joint I'm smoking. I notice an interesting effect I have not noticed on other Tryptamines, my eyes feel, and the effect on my vision makes it look like they are watering but when I go to wipe them they are completely dry, for some reason this seems very neat to me and I enjoy looking around like this for a couple minutes. The usual restlessness has begun in my legs, along with the all too familiar Tryptamine yawns, but right now anxiousness is the main feeling.<br>
        <br>
[1:10] By now I feel I am either a ++.5 or +++, but something else has changed, this doesn't feel like friendly territory, the head-space I'm in is somewhat confusing and it's very difficult to chat with my friends so I put on some music and stop paying attention to the computer. I'm going to have to say here the feeling is not all that great, there is next to no euphoria, and I would describe the head-space as more '2c-like' then 'Tryptamine-like'. The visuals are now in full effect and there is some movement and warping, a lot of shimmering in my peripheral vision, nothing like the beautiful sparkling fairy-tale like visuals of 4-Aco-DMT. Closed eye visuals are zero (but this is par for the course for me, on any drug, at any dose, except DMT).<br>
<br>
[1:26] Effects seem to have plateaued, but still seem somewhat difficult. The open eye visuals are still boring and I'm in a confused mental state, there is little flowing of ideas and no insight, I start to wonder what all the fuss was about with this one. At this point I just lie back, close my eyes and listen to the music. For me music and Tryptamines go together like nothing else I have ever experienced, I feel like I'm a part of the music and the baselines flow through me like pure cosmic energy. This does not happen on 4-HO-MPT for me, the music is cold and distant, almost distracting but I leave it on anyways and try to get something out of this experience.<br>
<br>
[2:00] I'm having a hard time telling how much time has passed, but I definitely feel the drug has started to drop off. I open my eyes and look at the clock.... 30 minutes? That's it? I'm not experiencing much time dilation, it hadn't felt that long since I closed my eyes, the feeling was more of disappointment. 30 minute plateau? I expected this drug to be short acting, but not this short acting, I'm down to a ++ now. <br>
<br>
[2:30] +.5 now and I smoke a bowl to try and bring it back up with marginal success. The music stops, but what feels like a slight buzzing in my ears continues... audio hallucinations? That's very interesting... I debate for a couple minutes if it is really audio hallucinations or just my roommate in the next room listening to his music at a volume I can barely hear... even after closely paying attention I can still not figure out which it is, I never did figure it out but the effect seemed to only last maybe 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
[3:00] 3 hours after ingestion I'm at a +. The lingering effects can only be described as unpleasant, gone are the visuals and I'm left with a confused/uncomfortable head-space, similar to the last couple hours of an LSD trip.<br>
<br>
[5:00] Trying to wait it out is not working and I finally realize the only way to end this is to go to bed, which I do, I toss and turn for about 30 minutes but after that sleep is good and I sleep through the night without any disturbances. In the morning I feel 100%, no hangover at all but also no glow that usually hangs around the day after tripping.<br>
<br>
Summary: After reading all the great reviews online and having high hopes for this drug, it leaves me significantly disappointed. What were these people so impressed with who had tried this before me? Did I take too much? I don't think so, the effects were not overwhelming, did the Marijuana have a negative effect? I mix Marijuana with all my psychedelics without issue, so I doubt it. Maybe it's just one of those things, different people get different effects.<br>
<br>
The duration is so short as to be useless, which sometimes is OK if you don't feel like tripping for 6+ hours but the difficult mental state the drug leaves me in after the major effects have worn off pretty much negates doing the drug early in the day with the plan to accomplish anything afterwards. No euphoria to speak of at all and boring visuals. Is it worth doing? For a psychonaut looking to just check it off the list, yes. For someone looking for a good time, probably not. The experience wasn't terrible overall and certainly not a 'bad trip' it was just uninteresting and plain with more of a head-trip then I expected. Look elsewhere, there are much better Tryptamines then this one out there.<!--   End Body   -->

What I‘m about to tell is a bit embarrassing, considering the fact that I’m a grown woman and should have known better. Anyway, here’s my story:<br>
<br>
I had found out about tripping on motion sickness pills by pure chance while browsing the web, and I was rather intrigued. I have never done any drugs besides alcohol, but I was fascinated by some of the experiences I read. So I went and bought some motion sickness pills that run under the brand name Vomex here in Germany, each pill containing 50 mg Dimenhydrinate. Mind you, I wasn’t after a full blown trip, I just wanted to test the waters, so to speak. Recently I have had trouble sleeping, and I figured at worst the pills would help me with that.<br>
<br>
So last Friday evening I changed into my PJs and settled comfortably on my bed with my netbook. I had decided that I would keep a log describing my experience. Being the careful person that I am (you’ll understand the irony of this later), I took one pill at 20:15pm to observe the way I’d react. Nothing happened. So an hour later I took two more pills. I thought I felt something then, but it was very weak and didn’t make me tired at all. In the opposite, I just got all shaky and my pulse went up.<br>
<br>
I waited until 21.30pm to take another two pills. Half an hour later, I still hadn’t noticed any effect. It was then that I made a rather stupid decision. I remembered that in the past I had once or twice taken Vomex against nausea after drinking too much, and I had always been out like a light half an hour later. So, in order to boost the effect of the pills, I poured myself a rather generous amount of gin and downed it in one go.<br>
<br>
By now it was about 23:00pm and I started to feel somewhat lightheaded, which I attributed mainly to the alcohol. The trembling from before had subsided and gradually I became more relaxed. But still no drowsiness.<br>
<br>
At 23:45pm I resolved to have another drink. About fifteen minutes later I was beginning to feel really drunk. I was seeing double by now and typing was becoming difficult. I was watching anime on my computer and noticed that following the story was getting rather tough. In retrospect, I guess I had reached the point at which the pills finally started to kick in, but at that time I blamed all of it merely on the alcohol. <br>
<br>
So of course at 12:30am I decided I would have another two pills. Now imagine my surprise when I noticed that not five but seven pills were already missing from the pack! I had apparently taken two more and forgotten about it. That should have been a warning sign, but at that point I was too far gone to care. So I told myself I’d simply take one more, bringing me up to a dose of 400 mg. I figured that should be safe enough, since it was the recommended maximum dose per day.<br>
<br>
By now my motor skills were deteriorating rapidly. When I had to go to the bathroom, my balance was severely off and I would have to hold onto walls and doors. Even sitting down on my bed, I couldn’t help swaying back and forth. I started to make a lot of typos in my entries, but at the same time I was enjoying myself immensely. That was when things started to get hazy.<br>
<br>
My log states that at about 1:00am I had my third drink, washing down the ninth pill, thus bringing me up to 450 mg. Unfortunately I have no recollection of doing this or of the hours that followed.<br>
<br>
I woke up in my bed at 10:20am. The computer was still running. It seems I stopped watching anime at some point, probably because I had no idea what was going on. I checked the browser’s history and found that I apparently had been browsing the web, though I can’t think why I would have been interested in some of those sites. For example I went to a website constructing anagrams, where I typed in some random letters. I was rather worried I might have engaged in “Drunk Mailing”, so I checked my email, too, but luckily there was nothing in the “Sent” folder. I guess I was too far gone to manage typing in the password, anyway. <br>
<br>
Another weird thing is that I apparently got up to get a sweater out of my wardrobe. I woke up having it wrapped around my shoulders, though I have absolutely no memory doing this. Also, I think I might have had another drink. The bottle of gin was half empty.<br>
<br>
Judging by my log I started to get seriously confused after 1.00am, as in the next entries I was already unable to give the correct time. The entries I made also become virtually unreadable pretty soon. Here’s an example:<br>
<br>
Just went to the bathroom. Well, staggg34 2ould b3 the corrxt te3rm. it#s rather cruytrating –b oops, again I’ve forgotten wasw NBPOUT TO SEE:<br>
<br>
The last entries are nothing but complete gibberish, random letters strung together. I made the last entry at 3.30am. (For some reasons I saved it in a separate file, so I was able to check the time.)<br>
<br>
When I now read my log, it’s really funny how I’m complaining about not feeling a thing for three hours, and then, WHAM, it hit me full force. Obviously I underestimated the stuff. I checked the facts online again and only then became aware that a trip with Dimenhydrinate will need some time to built up. In retrospect, the alcohol has been a mistake since it kept me from noticing the onset of the trip while also enhancing the effects of the drug. Since I took 450 mg, I might even have been hallucinating, but I have no idea if I actually did. I’m a bit annoyed that I can’t remember being so messed up, but at the same time I’m impressed.<br>
<br>
The next day the effects of the drug were still pretty noticeable. My head and legs felt heavy and my balance was still slightly off. Now and then I would have small muscle spasms like the ones you get shortly before falling asleep. Also my hands were rather shaky. I was rather glad that I had at least had the foresight to choose a Friday evening for my little adventure, so I was able to spent most of the next day in bed.<br>
<br>
Now, what did I learn from this?<br>
1. Mixing alcohol and Dimenhydrinate is not a good idea.<br>
2. Be patient and don’t redose, especially when already far from sober.<br>
3. Make sure I have nothing on my hands for the next day.<br>
<br>
I’m quite aware that things could have gotten nasty. I’m glad I didn’t do something stupid during my black-out, like falling asleep with a burning cigarette or taking any more pills. Overall I wouldn’t call it an unpleasant experience, though. I was feeling rather good the whole time (at least during the span of time I can actually remember), and found the hangover symptoms easy to deal with. I will definitely give the Dimenhydrinate another try sometime.<!--   End Body   -->

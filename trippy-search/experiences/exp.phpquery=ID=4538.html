Well, I never really thought much of this experience, until today I was browsing lycaeum.org and found that they added 'Buspar' to their psychoactive vaults. So, I thought I might as well add this trip report, in case anyone was curious about what Busphar does.<BR>
<BR>
First of all, some information about Buspar.<BR>
Buspar is pretty easy to get, doctors would gladly rather prescribe it for anti-anxiety than they would -zepam drugs and alprazolam, diazepam, etc. etc. Buspar is also prescribed to people who are quitting smoking.<BR>
<BR>
Despite the fact that my last 3 trip reports that I sent to this site were not posted, I will remain un-daunted.<BR>
<BR>
Mindset:<BR>
I just got the pills the period before (2nd period) and I had no idea what to expect, so I took 2.<BR>
<BR>
Experience:<BR>
It took them about 25 minutes to kick in. I was reading and all of the sudden a shock wave went through me. I didn't know if it was the Buspar or not, but then another went through me, and more and more. I had a bit of a body buzz, nothing special.<BR>
<BR>
Then, it was lunch time, I was not sure if I should eat or not, but I did anyway, I still had a slight body buzz, but nothing much. Then, I went to fourth period, and I had a terrible headache and I was nauseous, this finally went away fully about 5th period.<BR>
<BR>
I gave away some tabs to some friends, and later that night, I cleared out the bag of them, another 2 15 mg tablets.<BR>
<BR>
I ate these and smoked a bowl of weed, and listened to 'Dark Side of the Moon' by Pink Floyd. When I went to go to sleep, I had a pleasant buzz going on and waves going through me.<BR>
<BR>
My Thought:<BR>
Buspar isn't anything great at all, but if you do it, make sure you have some weed handy, it helps the buzz out alot.<!--   End Body   -->

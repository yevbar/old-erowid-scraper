The first time that i smoked crank i was with one of my friends, i was kinda scared and i didn't know what to expect.  i was curious so i decided that once wouldn't hurt.  me and my friend went out behind the school in my car and she proceeded to do up a foil.  i was intent on every thing she was doing.  i said i wanted one hit.  she took the first hit and showed me how to breathe in the smoke.  i then took my first hit.  at first i didn't feel anything.  i decided to take another one.  after awhile i noticed that i was talking.  i couldn't stop talking.  i wanted to talk about everything.<BR>
<BR>
i felt like everything was so clear to me.  i felt so smart.  i had so much energy. and i smoked some more.  my eyes were wide open.  and it felt as if they had a spring in them.  we went back to school and i felt like talking with everyone. another thing was i had to go to the bathroom more then i ever had before.  i hadn't even eaten yet that day.  i couldn't even think about school. i talked to this guy that i had been crushing all year.  we talked for the rest of the day and didn't go to classes.  <BR>
<BR>
after school i wanted to go somewhere and do something.  but i had nothing to do and no more to smoke.  my head was starting to pound and i felt exhausted.  i tried to sleep in the car while i waited for my boyfriend to get off work but i couldn't shut my eyes.  i knew i was hungry but i couldn't eat.  by the time we went home it was late.  i didn't sleep all that night.  the next day i still hadn't eaten, but yet i had gone to the bathroom a dozen times.  my mouth was dry and my head ached.  my jaw was sore because i had been clenching it all night.  i needed something to make me feel better.  so i went looking for my friend and i did it all over again.<!--   End Body   -->

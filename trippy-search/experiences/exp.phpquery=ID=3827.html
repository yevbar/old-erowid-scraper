After smoking weed several times with friends in various devices (water bong, pipe, & joint) I was unable to get more than a minute buzz.<BR>
<BR>
However, a few weeks ago I was at my friend's brother's house and we decided to give it another shot. I was almost ready to give up, believing marijuana would never have an affect on me and was doing more harm than good.<BR>
<BR>
The bong we used was beautiful, glass, and uniquely shaped. I had 2 really good hits and I was gone. Only a few weeks before I had gotten very drunk--and this felt much of the same way. I felt light and airy, movements were slower and humourous, and my body was somewhat numb and flowing. <BR>
<BR>
I was more lucid than when I was drunk, able to understand what was going on around me and communicate with my friends, asking questions about how long this feeling would last, etc.<BR>
<BR>
Walking was a bit difficult at first, but I managed. All I wanted to do was sleep and cuddle in my friend's lap. Compared to my friends, my reaction was a little strange. I also laughed hysterically for quite a bit of time.<BR>
<BR>
An hour or so later I was pretty much okay and later than evening I was 100% okay. I was back to a completely comprehensive state. I'm looking forward to my next high. It's more fulfilling than drinking, even if it is a little more expensive. At least I don't vomit when I smoke.<!--   End Body   -->

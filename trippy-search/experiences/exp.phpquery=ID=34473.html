Background: I'm 20 years old, in OK physical/mental shape, and I don't use any drug with any sort regular frequency. Rarely do I do any drugs at all at this point in my life.<BR>
<BR>
Normally, I have a hard time getting to sleep. It takes me anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to get so sleep after going to bed, usually.<BR>
<BR>
In short, my 'sleeping schedule' is all fucked up. When I have no commitments and I just go to sleep when I'm tired, I end up staying up for about 20 hours and sleeping for around 10 hours. I also tend to be awake more at night and less during the day. My body seems to be happy with this schedule, but socioty does not.<BR>
<BR>
So, I decided to try some melatonin for a while to see if it will help me. I've been getting to bed around 5:00 AM for the last 3 nights (it was a weekend), and I have work tomorrow at 1:00 PM.<BR>
<BR>
These are my notes on 1-day-short-of two weeks of using 1mg melatonin sublingual tablets as a sleep aid.<BR>
<BR>
May 31 @ 2:50 AM<BR>
1mg melatonin sublingual<BR>
May 31 @ 3:30 AM<BR>
Another 1mg melatonin sublingual<BR>
Fell asleep: ~4:00 AM<BR>
<BR>
June 1 @ ~3:00 AM<BR>
2mg melatonin sublingual<BR>
Fell asleep: ~4:00 AM<BR>
<BR>
June 2 @ 2:30 AM<BR>
4mg melatonin sublingual<BR>
I'm finally tired @ 2:51 AM<BR>
Fell asleep: ~3:10<BR>
I am very tired upon waking.<BR>
<BR>
June 2 @ 2:11 AM<BR>
4mg melatonin sublingual<BR>
Fell asleep: ~2:30<BR>
I am extremely tired upon waking.<BR>
<BR>
June 4th @ 2:20 AM<BR>
4mg melatonin sublingual<BR>
Fell asleep: ~3:00 AM<BR>
I am very tired upon waking.<BR>
<BR>
June 5th @ around 4: something AM<BR>
4mg melatonin sublingual<BR>
Fell asleep: around 5:00 - 6:00 AM <BR>
I am very tired upon waking.<BR>
<BR>
June 6th @ 3:30 AM<BR>
3mg melatonin sublingual<BR>
I am suddenly tired at 3:45 AM, went to bed.<BR>
No notes written down.<BR>
<BR>
June 7th @ 1:00 AM<BR>
4mg melatonin sublingual<BR>
I awoke 6 to 7 hours later not 'groggy' or tired.<BR>
<BR>
June 8th @ 1:50 AM<BR>
4mg melatonin sublingual<BR>
I didn't get to sleep for at least 45 minutes.<BR>
I slept 12 hours.<BR>
I am very tired upon awaking.<BR>
<BR>
June 9th @ 4:09 AM<BR>
4mg melatonin sublingual<BR>
I went to bed at 4:14 AM.<BR>
I have to get up at 8:00 AM.<BR>
I slept 4 hours and got up, a little bit (but not very) tired.<BR>
<BR>
June 10 @ 1:19 AM<BR>
4mg melatonin sublingual (after not sleeping all day)<BR>
I have to get up ~7:30 AM.<BR>
I got ~5-6 hours of sleep.<BR>
I was tired most of the day after waking up.<BR>
<BR>
June 11 @ 3:05 AM<BR>
4mg melatonin sublingual<BR>
June 11 @ 3:20 AM<BR>
1mg melatonin sublingual<BR>
I become tired @ 3:41 AM and go to bed. <BR>
I obtained sleep @ 4: something AM.<BR>
I got up @ 1:00 PM, but could have sleep for many hours more.<BR>
I am very tired upon awaking. <BR>
<BR>
June 12 @ 5:52 AM<BR>
2mg melatonin sublingual<BR>
I'm tired anyway, but I'm taking two.<BR>
Thank God I don't have work tomorrow.<BR>
<BR>
Basically, this stuff isn't helping, or I'm becoming too tolerant. It would be OK if I wasn't so tired in the mornings.<BR>
I noticed no diffence in the frequency or vividness of my dreams when I was taking it from when I wasn't.<BR>
<BR>
Once this bottle runs out, I'm not buying another, but I'll use it untill it's all gone.<!--   End Body   -->

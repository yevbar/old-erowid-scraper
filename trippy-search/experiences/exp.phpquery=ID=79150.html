Before I start I just want to say that I was always an outgoing, extroverted kid. I was always nice to everyone and always had many close relationships with friends. I loved life as a kid. With that being said, here&#8217;s my story.<br>
<br>
When I was 13 my parents got divorced. I wasn&#8217;t upset about it, but my siblings both went off to college the same year, I just hit puberty so I got a little emotional, and my whole life changed completely so I was a little sad about my situation. So my mom forced me to a psychiatrist who instantly prescribed me Prozac to take each day because I said I was a little &#8220;sad.&#8221; But there&#8217;s a BIG difference between being sad and being clinically depressed. I was against it, as I knew I didn&#8217;t need some foreign drug to help me. But my mom screamed at me over and over until I took it because a real &#8220;doctor&#8221; told her I needed it, and she just wanted to help me. So I started taking it to get my mom off my back. I had no clue what that little blue capsule was for, I was just following my moms &#8220;parenting.&#8221;<br>
<br>
So at this time I&#8217;m in 8th grade and I had just hit puberty. I really had no self-awareness that we have as adults, so any effect that this drug had on my mood was clearly unnoticed by me; I was just going through life. After a few months, I started to become emotionally numb. It also made me anxious, insecure, and tired all at the same time. My over-dramatic mom would argue with me and I would have very violent outbursts, often slamming doors and punching walls. Again I had no clue this was from the Prozac, it was just how I felt so I kept taking it. My mom thought it was just my rebellious nature so she took me back to the psych and he increased my dosage because I wasn't improving.<br>
<br>
By the time I&#8217;m 15 I had been on the medicine for 2 years now. The sex drive that I once had at 12-13 from hitting puberty is now gone. At this point I&#8217;m so confused about life and who I am that I&#8217;m just gliding through life like a zombie. My mom thinks my &#8220;depression&#8221; isn&#8217;t improving so she keeps me on the medicine and by this point taking the medicine is 2nd nature so I just take it every day. The fights my mom and I have are worse now. Im breaking things in the house and constantly yelling back at my mom. I completely fail my freshman year of high school and have no motivation for anything. I still have no clue this is from the Prozac, as my mom and the doctor insist I &#8220;need&#8221; it. My heart, emotions, and natural personality are slowly starting to fade.<br>
<br>
So by the time I&#8217;m 17 I&#8217;m still on Prozac cause my mom sees such a great decrease in my character in me over the past few years, so she assumes that there&#8217;s no way I can go without Prozac. I&#8217;m in 11th grade by this point and my sex drive is completely gone, I have no personality, and I&#8217;ve been kicked out of 2 high schools. My emotion is gone, so I&#8217;m basically a vegetable by this point, almost to the level of legal insanity. My insecurity gets so bad that I have trouble going to class. When I&#8217;m around class mates I get so nervous and constantly worry about what other people think of me after I say something, to an extreme I&#8217;ve never ever experienced before. The only thing that calms my anxiety and makes me feel better from these horrible side effects is marijuana, so I&#8217;m smoking massive amounts of marijuana at this point. <br>
<br>
By the end of my senior year I&#8217;m 18 and have been on the Prozac for 5 years, all because my mom kept refilling the prescription over and over saying I &#8220;need&#8221; it. I have been kicked out of 3 schools by this point, all for smoking marijuana. In a way, I was only self medicating with the marijuana because it was the only thing that helped me cope with my Prozac-induced anxiety. At this point my social anxiety gets so bad from the Prozac that everyone around me starts to notice. I can&#8217;t even have a strong conversation with someone because my brain has been so altered from this medicine. I have no self awareness on anything and the only thing I know is this feeling. So by the time I barely graduate at 18 I am basically a nothing person. I don&#8217;t know how to socialize, have zero sex drive, and just have overall no emotion or confidence in anything. This is quite close to insanity in my opinion. <br>
<br>
I finally go off the medicine at 18 and I have no clue about anything your supposed to learn as an adolescent like basic life skills and social skills. I was in a cloud of &#8220;nothingness&#8221; all those years. The doctor never explained anything about Prozac to me and my mom kept giving it to me with such great energy so I just kept taking it. It&#8217;s a very sneaky drug, it makes you feel completely different but it feels natural. That&#8217;s why people kill themselves on it: because they don&#8217;t realize it&#8217;s the drug making them feel that way, its just how they feel. <br>
<br>
From age 18-21 I literally had no clue who I was. I had no friends and really didn&#8217;t know how to do anything. And the only thing that made me feel normal was illegal drugs or more anti depressants&#8230; I feel my brain had almost chemically become a drug addict&#8230; One more thing: Prozac also stunted my pubertal growth. I didn&#8217;t grow one inch during puberty while on Prozac, so I am basically stuck in a 13 year olds body. My whole family is tall, except for me. I can&#8217;t prove this but studies are just now coming out saying it stunts growth in children and it all makes sense why I didn&#8217;t grow.<br>
<br>
So now I&#8217;m 21 and I&#8217;m just now starting to get my sex drive back along with some emotion. I have major difficulty socializing and holding a job. And the worst part about this whole experience is I didn&#8217;t realize that ANY of this was going on until about a few months ago. I was just going through high school regardless of how I felt. I didn&#8217;t know anything about fluoxetine and how it affected my mood/behavior so I just took it everyday as prescribed. These antidepressants really mess with your head way worse than 99% of all illegal drugs. With drugs like LSD and marijuana, I only have experiences that enhance my life and the lives of others. But with SSRI&#8217;s, they do something different. They change who you are. Some people need these meds, but if you don&#8217;t need them and you take them they will probably screw you up.<br>
<br>
The best way for me to explain my situation is the snowball effect. Before I went on antidepressants, my life issues were a small snowball. When I was put on the meds, my issues/the snowball started going downhill and the snowball/my issues only got bigger. The longer I was on the meds the bigger my issues got. By the time I got to the bottom of the hill, which is the end of my pubety at 18, I am stuck with a massive snowball of mental issues that might take years to recover from.<!--   End Body   -->

INTRODUCTION:<br>
<br>
I am not just writing a “I got fucked up!!!”  report, but a guided tour of how I get high using needles.<br>
 <br>
<br>
It is a hassle not having a car, and having to sneak around discretely. My roommate has no clue I do anything worse than smoke pot. So waiting at the coffee shop, I lost patience on my first coke-dealer (had to work at 6:00 PM)….so my heroin guy picked up the coke as well before he picked me up drove me home. The first dealer’s phone calls were “ignored” since he was late. So I scored a half-gram of heroin, and a “teener” (1/16th of ounce) of cocaine for the price of an eightball. I was limited on time since I had to work, and wasn’t going without the rewards of payday……<br>
<br>
<br>
A.) The Cocaine Ringer...<br>
<br>
4,30 PM:  I went to my bathroom and carefully rationed out a ½ gram of coke in my spoon. I measured 40 cc of water. I rolled up a q-tip for a filter. The cocaine was good quality, chunky and had a rainbow shine. It dissolved well in the water and turned clear. I always get real excited when get ready to shoot up, had to do it slowly because my hands were shaking. I popped it into a good vein in my forearm. I pulled the plunger back to get a blood flow. Bingo! I shot it all in. As soon as I shot a rinse of water from my needle into my mouth I felt the desired effects. The taste slowly fills all of the taste-buds, nerves, and tissue. My whole body felt like a warm blanket covered my skin from toes up to my scalp. The music I had playing had a great flangy/ phaser effect and all I could do was just say ahhhh! The body buzz was more euphoric than ecstasy! That with the sound effects was my chemical-orgasm. There are no words to describe the feeling. <br>
<br>
4:40 PM: Slowly felt the peak fade away.  Now this is where I want to do something so I don’t “get stuck on stupid”…the restless energy I am left with tweeking on coke.<br>
<br>
<br>
B.) The Heroin Follow-up…<br>
<br>
I wasn’t going to work half-cocked. I needed a balance for the coke, and booze wasn’t an option. Now I never mix cocaine and heroin at the same time because I cook my heroin, where if you cook the coke it’s gonna turn gooey and harden, thus clogging the needle and wasting dope.<br>
<br>
4:55 PM: The heroin was a gray/tan chunk. I crushed it into a fine powder. I dumped about and tenth of a gram, maybe more into the spoon. I measured out 40 cc of water and slowly squirted it into the powder. I then lit the bottom of the spoon with my lighter until the brown mixture dissolved into a golden liquid. I dropped a new q-tip ball into the mix and pulled out a good 35 cc. I then found a different vein to shoot the dope in. I felt it immediately. Ahhhh! Kind of like 5 long island ice teas or  taking 5 1,000 mg vicodine pills. I get a nice body buzz and a spinning in my head. I always want to be seated when I do this. Breathe. Relax and enjoy. This lasted over 8 hours. I always end my coke rush with a heroin glow to get rid of the cravings.  <br>
<br>
<br>
C.) SUMMARY<br>
<br>
Work was a breeze. Only one of my supervisors sensed I may have been on something, but is cool and told me to smoke pot after work next time. I repeated the same steps as above until I reached a critical supply level. I wrapped the goodies up and am saving them for a rainy day….<!--   End Body   -->

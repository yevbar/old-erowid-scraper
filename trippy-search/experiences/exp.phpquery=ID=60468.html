A Bright White, Infinitely Serene Celestial Paradise I Call Bliss<br>
<br>
I ground 18 grams of Mimosa Hostilis root bark and 6 grams of Peganum Harmala separately in a coffee grinder. I then blended five lemons and added the pulpy solution to a stainless steel pot. I added the ground Mimosa Hostilis to the solution and began the boiling process. I lightly boiled the mixture for twenty minutes and then strained it through a t-shirt. I repeated the process two more times, each time collecting the liquid in the same container. After the third extraction I discarded the depleted Mimosa material and returned the cumulative collected liquid to the pot and boiled it down to a small, drinkable amount of liquid.<br>
<br>
I set up my trip area with blankets and pillows on the floor, some plants, including a small tree and a large selection of didgeridoo and tribal drumbeats music. I turned off the lights and lit candles. My girlfriend and I prepared the pre-ground Peganum Harmala into two equal piles of three grams, added each pile to a glass of water respectively and consumed. Fifteen minutes later, I ingested the equivalent of nine grams of Mimosa Hostilis in my prepared tea form and my girlfriend consumed approximately six grams. I immediately felt I had to vomit, which is unlike me, as I have a stomach of steel.    <br>
<br>
We lay down on the blankets on the floor and relaxed as we waited for the effects to kick in. About 20 minutes later I began to feel brief, intense waves of psychedelic activity come over me. Poignant words like Love, God and Christ overwhelmed me as I shuddered at their outstanding profundity. At this point, I would momentarily lose sight of myself and ever so briefly lose my grip on reality. I began to think that maybe I had gotten in way over my head and that this could be a life changing experience. I remembered what it feels like to trip hard and although not at this point yet, lose complete touch with reality. I had a complete mental block. I couldn’t remember why I had done the Ayahuasca.<br>
<br>
The effects elevated. The tree I had put in my room earlier was now methodically moving its branches, paralleled only by one prior mushroom experience, where I witnessed an identical display of trees showcasing their celestial dancing abilities. I could feel the tree using its strange energy to pull me, almost invite me to enter the DMT universe. At this point, the intoxication was strong and borderline frightening. I hesitated and closed my eyes, only to be greeted by intense, vivid closed-eye visuals of fierce animals with gnarly expressions, mostly big cats. One tiger-like cat with bright, almost electric purple tentacular rays of brilliant energy emanating from its body really stood out in my mind. I began telling myself, “it’s okay, you can control this, you are in control”, I turned to my girlfriend and told her not to panic, that everything would be over eventually, but to my surprise she was not experiencing the Ayahuasca to nearly the same degree as I was.<br>
<br>
A brief vision of an Amazonian shaman with a jaguar-tooth necklace helped me keep a grip on what sanity I had left. I said to myself, “this is what the shaman sees, you are the shaman, you are the ayahuasca”. Between the severe nausea, the closed eye visuals of fierce, scary, out of this world big cats and the tree formally inviting me into a universe of potentially endless possibilities, I did what had to be done - I turned over and purged my guts out!<br>
<br>
The purging lessened the intensity of my experience, but only enough to allow me to cope with my altered state of consciousness. I felt like my sense of self was being systematically broken down. We turned on some music and I laid back and closed my eyes. I took flight, not in a literal sense, but viewing Ayahuasca visions with my eyes closed is like being airborne somehow, like I am floating through other dimensions. I saw many fierce animals, including big cats, snakes and even for a brief moment, a Native American serpent. <br>
<br>
The music started to brilliantly influence my experience. I could feel the didgeridoo throughout my body, I moved to the beat. The frightening imagery ceased, and I was all of a sudden, floating in a magnificent room made of solid gold, overlaid with intricate, mosaic design. In the middle of the room, suspended majestically in thin air, was a giant statue of Buddha. I was overtaken by euphoria. The only word to describe this state was - “bliss”. Then, as quickly as it began, I was sucked in to the next scene, again seeing images of fierce gnarly big cats and some red and black snakes. Throughout this experience I must have used the phrase “Oh my God!” about fifty times to describe my state of mind, although it did absolutely no justice to describe the truly revolutionary thoughts and mind-blowing imagery I was experiencing. My mental block was lifted, now I remembered why I had done the Ayahuasca in the first place. Next stop on my cosmic journey was a bright white, infinitely serene celestial paradise I called “bliss”. I imagined what it would be like to spend the rest of eternity in bliss and it sent waves of giddy euphoria through me.<br>
<br>
I was really having some extraordinary, existential thoughts like, “what is the nature of reality. We know as human beings that matter is made of particles, which are constantly moving and not solid. Using this principle, we know that objects we see and feel are solid, for example a wall, theoretically can’t be, thus proving that the human brain creates a projection of reality that is not congruent with science. This proves that the human brain projects an image of reality that is not entirely real at all. With this said, the tree, which is now moving right before my eyes, could in all actuality be moving like this all of the time, yet my normal conscious brain’s projection of so called reality, doesn’t allow me to see this phenomena. Reality is only a projection of the normal conscious brain, but in no way reflects what is really happening all around us.” <br>
<br>
With my eyes closed again, I had a vision of overlooking a beautiful gorge with waterfalls on both sides, absolutely brilliant. I believe, had I not purged, the visions would have been so strong they could be conceived as real.<br>
<br>
I noticed at this point, that my thoughts had become so deep and complex, that I was arguing with myself. I would start a thought and then interject and begin rambling another opposing thought. It was as if different parts of my brain were in the middle of a heated discussion. My next major break-through thought was actually the answer to all of life’s problems. I remember it clear as day. The Ayahuasca had given me the secret to life and it is so simple. The answer to everything is - love. I realized for the first time in my life that love is the answer to everything and this filled me with immense joy and elation. I became giddy at the idea.<br>
<br>
The closest thing I can equate Ayahuasca to is death. During the experience I learned that the physical body is just a shell and Ayahuasca allows one to free themselves from the restrictions of the physical body and sense of self and venture into what I believe could be what the afterlife is like, if the two are not actually one in the same. One taps into something that is literally, larger than life. It encompasses all life, as we know it. It is like an infinite entity, a collective consciousness that is one. It is what life as we know it stems from, our origin the Earth’s origin. This entitative consciousness, whatever it may be, the Afterlife, the Logos, God, an alternate dimension, may be hard for just anyone to comprehend, but when you get there, it is like you are home. You don’t wonder what you are doing there, or how you got there, it is like you are back in the womb with complete recollection. Ayahuasca taught me that there is no such thing as the self, the self is merely an illusion. Everything is one in the same and this thing called life is an intermission between birth and death. Birth is the acquisition of your physical body and death is where your physical body ceases to exist, it is where your soul or consciousness returns to this magnificent entity, similar, if not identical to Ayahuasca. <br>
<br>
The music was creating cultural imagery in my head that was most appealing. I wondered how Ayahuasca, and other entheogenic substances, seemed to be engrained with specific human culture. For example, Ayahuasca seems to carry with it images of jungle animals. Is this a product of suggestion? Does researching the cultural use of these substances before trying them influence your experience? Or do these substances create un-biased jungle imagery in anyone’s mind, regardless of cultural background, or knowledge of the origins of this Amazonian drink? These are certainly the mysteries of Ayahuasca and other entheogenic substances for that matter.<br>
<br>
With my eyes closed I saw vivid images of another world. A black salamander with pink splotches and a black frog with blue spots sat atop a vibrantly colored leaf in what seemed like an alternate reality that could be existing congruently with ours. These were no ordinary amphibians, they seemed to be from a very different, alternate reality or other dimension.<br>
<br>
The effects of the Ayahuasca quickly tapered off and left me in a state of cosmic awe. After some hasty contemplation I consumed my girlfriend’s leftover mimosa tea (approx. 3 grams) <br>
<br>
Ten to fifteen minutes later the effects began, starting with the now familiar nausea. I stared intently at the tree, which had been symbolic of the entire experience. I was convinced that the DMT spirits had used the tree to communicate with me. They were using the tree as a vessel with which to communicate an invitation into their universe. Again, the tree began methodically moving its branches, using its energy to invite me in the DMT dimension. Seconds later, an entity appeared, vividly, stable and unflinching. My jaw dropped! I turned to my girlfriend and said “ Oh my God! I am seeing aliens!” The entity looked almost identical to the stereotypical archetype of an alien, large cranium tapering down to a pointy yet rounded chin, only this alien was translucent. Its color was a transparent, yet vibrant, electric alien blue. At first, I was quite frightened and thrown awry. However, my interest in the creature far outweighed my fear, so I sucked it up and just stared in awe at this seemingly real tree entity. I stared at it and it stared at me. At one point, I believed I was possibly staring at myself in an alternate universe. Sort of like staring into an alien mirror and instead of seeing my reflection, having my identical alien self, stare back at me from an alternate reality. <br>
<br>
I was sober enough to be describing this to my girlfriend real-time, yet inebriated to the point that this so called “hallucination” seemed completely genuine. This experience went far beyond a subtle hallucination. It seemed real and shattered any pre-conceptions I held about the nature of reality – truly a mind-bending experience.  <br>
<br>
I am quite amazed at the amount of clear, concise, useful information I have recalled from this Ayahuasca session. It was really an amazing mystical experience and I feel that I am taking a great deal from it. I have been thinking about the experience since I had it around one week ago. I still feel very alive. Ayahuasca has lifted me from my boring, mundane pre-conceptions of life and allowed me to see that there is more to life than meets the eye. It has opened the doors of perception. To have a good experience with Ayahuasca, one must do one's research and put a great deal of time and effort in to preparation. This can be a very powerful substance and very frightening, although I did not experience this to its full capacity. Treat Ayahuasca with respect as with any entheogen and you, too, may get to ride the celestial highway. <br>
<br>

I ordered 50 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds for 15 bucks online.  They were the Hawaiian strain, which I figured would probably be more potent since it was where they were more expensive.  I received them pretty quickly (3 days, priority mail), and waited until I was done with finals to try them.  I decided to try them yesterday.  In preparation to reduce nausea, I only ate a small meal at 12:00pm.<br>
<br>
At 7:30 PM last night, I took 9 seeds out of my bag.  They already had the fuzzy coating removed, and I cut each in half with a knife.  I took two dramamines before I ingested them to counter the expected nausea.  I placed 10 halves (5 seeds) in a teacup filled with water, as suggested on the web, and microwaved them for 40 seconds.  I got them out of the water, and ate them.  They were pretty chewy because of the microwave, and went down fairly easy.  The taste was bland...I think next time I'll put some honey in my mouth or just wash em down with pop.  I drank some of the water but I figured it was stupid.  I put 8 more halves (4 seeds) and microwaved them in water for another 40 seconds.  I ate these, drank a bit of Mountain Dew, took one more Dramamine, and sat down to chill.  When all this was said and done it was 7:45 PM.<br>
<br>
Within 15 minutes I started to feel a bit heavy.  I was bored so I went and took a shower.  I watched TV until about 9:30.  I was pissed because nothing had happened at all yet other than the heaviness.  I didn't feel any nausea either, which is a telltale sign something's gonna happen.  My friends were over and we decided to go get something to eat.  I had decided that the seeds weren't working, and I was pretty mad since they cost me $15, and I'm a poor college student.  We went to a restaurant.  I was kinda high on the seeds, in a good mood and heavy feeling, but nothing close to tripping...maybe like I'd smoked a bowl or two.<br>
<br>
We ordered a delicious appetizer, and I ate it right up.  I went into the bathroom, I looked fine.  Upon receiving our entrees, I decided I wasn't hungry at all.  I felt a little nausea, went to the bathroom, and tried to force myself to puke.  It didn't work, and I went and looked in the mirror, and my pupils were very dilated.  I decided I didn't want to stay, since I had just gotten off an MJ possession probation.  I know HBWR is legal and all, but I don't think I'd wanna explain to cops why my pupils were the size of dimes.  So we left the restaurant.  That's when it absolutely slapped me at about 9:45, 2 hours after ingesting them.  When my friend started driving, I felt like we were going 90mph, then 10.  Every turn felt way too wide.  When my friend pulled up to the curb, I thought he was gonna go right over it and smash into my front door.<br>
<br>
I went inside, no nausea yet.  I started watching TV and talking online, listening to a little music (which, obviously, was awesome on this substance).  My friend was flipping through channels, and there was an asian baseball player on tv.  It said like 'Comparing Ichiro,' obviously meaning they were comparing him to someone else.  I was like, 'Comparing Ichirio?  What kind of name is Compa-ring???'<br>
<br>
Nausea (very bearable) finally hit me for about 10 minutes, and I threw up my delicious appetizer and mashed potatoes.  After that, the nausea was totally gone gone, and I think I plateaued.  I had been playing Warcraft III all day, and I kept seeing characters for that (closed eye).  I went in my bathroom with the lights off, and I tried to make myself see scary shit.  I did, and just laughed at it.  It was easy to distinguish reality from fantasy, and I could see anything I wanted to (closed eye).  I had a cigarette outside.  I couldn't feel the smoke or taste it, and I felt like I was taking huge hits when I was taking really small ones.<br>
<br>
We started watching Peewee's Playhouse on Cartoon Network.  The show was very funny on this substance.  Everything was funny and I was babbling to my friend about goofy shit.  I kept twitching my arm though for some reason, and I didn't stop moving my legs all night.  It was apparent I was on something, so I stayed at my apartment until later.  Everything had a rhythm to it, and all the lights were bright, glowing, and warm.  My lamp has a funny pattern on it, and touching it was really neat.  I ate a pack of Gushers.  The sugar tingled my tongue, and the chewy texture plus gooey liquid was amazing in my mouth.  Try different textured foods and objects on this, it's fun.<br>
<br>
I was in my room on the computer.  I got really tired, and wanted to go to bed.  However my friend was over and I figured it'd be rude to sleep.  I put my head on my monitor.  It felt really warm...the glass right now is cool to the touch.  I could've fallen asleep on it.  I went downstairs and took some Guarana (in the form of an energy pill also containing Ginseng and a few other 'energy' herbals).  I was wide awake within 15 minutes, so I doubt it was from the pills.  Keep in mind that every minute feels like 10 on this stuff.  I tripped for about 2 hours total, but it felt like 5.<br>
<br>
We watched some more TV, and I was having a blast.  I started to come down a bit at Midnight, so we went to the strip club.  I think it would've been much more fun when I was peaking, but I was still pretty high.  The cigarettes tasted gross - I smoke Dunhills which taste more natural than most cigs (no additives).  They reminded me of the taste of the seeds, which made me feel kinda weird. So I put it out and just chilled.  Some friends of mine were there, and they had rented a big velvet couch.  So I undid my top two buttons on my shirt, and layed back, imitating Tony Montana in a coked out daze.  <br>
<br>
For the first two hours at the strip club I was pretty high.  I couldn't feel parts of my body.  I could've pissed my pants and not known.  That area was numb, but then it got really sensitive later.  I imagine sex on these would be fun (on a lower dose).  I couldn't feel the Coca Cola I was drinking, but I could feel it at the same time.  I found this to be true often with this.  You could do something yet not do it at the same time.  Don't ask me how to explain it.  I finally came down off my high at 2 AM, and all the effects subsided around 2:30.<br>
<br>
I ate some pizza rolls, and got a very great sleep.  I woke up at 2 PM, and I feel like a million bucks right now.  My next planned dose is 13 seeds.<!--   End Body   -->

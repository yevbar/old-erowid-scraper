I was given a capsule with 20 mg of 2C-T-2 by a friend while the two of were camping by a lake.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 30 min;  Nothing.  I begin to forget about the possiblity of the drug having any effect on me.  <BR>
<BR>
T+ 1:00;  With surprising speed, a warm body high swells in my stomach and fills my legs, much like a dose of Percocet or Vicoden.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 1:10;  Blades of grass seem particularly pronounced in color and texture.  Little things begin to seem amplified.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 1:15;  Blades of grass have started twinkling and wavering as if underwater.  The campfire, including the metal ring around it, is wobbling and rising into the air.  Wonderful body high and a warm flush of lucidity throughout come-up.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 1:50;  Incredible visuals!  Tracers, patterns and shape-shifting is astounding, especially due to the lucidity of the drug.  The best part:  Conversation is free-flowing, meaningful, and far beyond 'coherent.'  Oddly, it feels like the drug is restoring coherence to both internal and external dialogues.  Feelings of warmth, safety, peace, well-being and love flow between us and between nature around us.  Time seems to move incredibly slowly.  We keep laughing at our discovery that everything is going to be alright - not with us and the drug, but with the world and humanity and death and family.  Perhaps this is a typical response to the drug, but it can't be overstated.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 7:00;  Effects (visual and emotional) are still mild when we fell asleep in our tent.<BR>
  <BR>
T+ 5 months:  This trip was life-changing.  2C-T-2 can absolutely blow doors off their hinges with respect to ego, fear, anger and anxiety.  This could have been a lucky trip...it certainly seemed sanctioned by the universe at the time.  I would recommend handling this substance with extreme care and respect, because its effects can be way, way out there.<!--   End Body   -->

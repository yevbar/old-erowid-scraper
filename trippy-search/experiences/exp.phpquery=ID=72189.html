First a little history on my experience with psychoactives. I first started doing chemicals (I hate the bad stigma attached to the word 'drugs') at 14 years old. By the time I was 16 I had done almost any chemical you could name. I could not begin to tell you how many times I have tripped on shrooms and acid. I am a habitual marijuana smoker but none was smoked at all during the day of this experience. Now on to the matter at hand. <br>
<br>
I was woken up at 11:30 A.M. by my roommate throwing my Trichocereus Peruvianus that I had ordered 4 days prior onto my stomach and saying 'You got something from UPS'. I immediately knew what this was and was very excited that it had arrived so quickly. I quickly got out of bed and opened my package like a kid on Christmas morning. Looking at it I thought about trying it but I had to work at 5 P.M. that afternoon. So I decided to take what I thought would be a threshold dose of 14 grams. I seperated the powder at the bottom from the large chunks and decided that this was probably not enough (I had never tried this sacred cactus before) so I broke up one medium size chunk to add to the powder. Thinking (I had no scale or prior experience with cactus weight) this was about 14-15 grams. I was satisfied that I would only feel threshold effects. I could not have been more wrong.<br>
<br>
So I proceeded to crush it with a hammer in the envelope it came in with little success. After doing this I ate it pretty quickly chewing it, it tasted more foul than anything I have ever eaten before so I chased it down with some Dr Pepper finishing it around 12:15. Very little nausea and no vomiting throughout the experience. <br>
<br>
T +0:00     I began just doing menial tasks around the house. Finishing my tasks I sat in my recliner watching television. At this point I began to feel very stretchy, an odd sensation. Shortly therafter it was as if my thoughts were coming from just behind and above my head. I knew I was beginning to feel the effects of Madame M so I decided to go to work and visit with my friend who was there drinking some beers (I work at a bar). <br>
<br>
T +1:30       On my walk to work the effects started to escalate and this is when I realized that maybe I had not taken a threshold dose at all as I shot right past what I thought should be threshold effects. Around halfway to work I began to get very euphoric and more content than I can ever remember being before and colours seemed very bright and vivid and I could see what appeared to be faint but very distinct auras around all living things, even bugs and plants. Upon arriving to work these effects had escalated to the point where they were all encompassing, I had no choice but to see them, which was alright by me as I enjoyed them thoroughly.<br>
<br>
<br>
T +2:00      Arriving at work my aural vision was immensely vivid and powerful and I could feel the love of all things in nature which made me even more elated. This elation lasted throughout most of the experience. My friend was very interested in my experience and a little jealous that he was not tripping as well. We sat talking about my effects and some small insights that I already seemed to be gaining. One of which was how closely human society resembles that of insects. The experience is still escalating at an unbelievably comfortable pace. I just walked around enjoying my trip then I remembered that I had to get on the clock in a couple of hours and I KNEW that I would be tripping face when I did. This state of vision and insight got exponentially stronger over the next couple of hours.  <br>
<br>
T +4:00      I was now clocked in and doing prep work (I am a cook). This is when I began feeling my first hints of disembodiment, aside from my thoughts. As I was working I began to see myself from above doing my tasks in what I can only describe as a 'thought cloud'. The really odd thing was that I was still functioning just fine even using knives. I do not recomend using knives when tripping, but I had no choice. When I would walk my disembodied vision would lower itself to follow my body so I was watching myself walking in front of me seeing my double mohawks and the design on the back of my shirt. I looked at the clock after what seemed like hours had passed but it was only minutes. This led to my comprehension of infinity in a moment. Every moment seemed like forever, never ending yet never begining. At this point I stopped looking at the clock as it no longer held any meaning for me so the rest of the timeline is estimated except for the total duration.<br>
<br>
T  +5:30?     I began rolling hamburger meat into balls for cooking and this proved to be one of the most morally apprehensive things that I have ever done. Morally the implications of what I was doing were horrid as I knew this was once a living being that I was now rolling into little balls for the consumption of people. Not to mention that the meat seemed to be still alive, it was moving and feeling pain as I squeezed it and rolled it into balls. Totally horrible, I am not sure what word could sum up how terrible this seemed to me but I knew that I had to do it because I was at work. <br>
<br>
T +6:30?     I had finally began to peak even though I had been in a disembodied state for what seemed to be the whole entirety of time as humans know it. Just so happened that I was now cooking on the grill. The whole process of cooking dead chickens and cows made me feel as though humans have made no REAL progress since the barbarians of Norway and Finland. Which is an insight that I hold to this day 2 weeks after the experience. I still eat meat, not sure for how long though. <br>
<br>
T +8:00?        I thought that I had started to reach a plateau and decided to use the restroom, which I had not done since shortly after consumption. I found evacuating the waste from my body to be extremely pleasurable. But this was the point where I realized that I was still peaking. Don't know if this was due to the evacuation process or the change in atmosphere. Then I went back to cooking. It was a VERY busy day at work. I went most of the day at work totally lucid and completely able to comprehend what I was doing and reply coherently to people's requests and questions. Other than replies I was very introverted most of the day. Luckily I had no reason to read as the tickets were read aloud by someone else for us all to hear. I doubt that I could have read anyhow. <br>
<br>
T  +10:00?    By this time I had began to grow closer to the vessel of flesh that was 'me' yet still not merged at this time. I began to do the end of night cleaning which proved to be a great relief from the morally apprehensible duty of cooking the carcasses of other living beings. I swept up the floors and began to mop, which is when my body and my mind met once again. I must admit though that I felt a sort of dread to be locked in this frame again, this rotting flesh and bone. I think this is due to the preparation and cooking of the animal flesh as I realized their flesh was no different than mine. This soon subsided though.<br>
<br>
Upon finishing the mopping I was feeling like I had on the come-up like when I arrived at work. I had finished my duties and clocked out, I then called a different friend than the one I had talked to earlier to come pick me up and we went to his house. There we sat and talked about my experience as he is an experienced shaman and very interested in what I had to say. He actually has every type of psychoactive cactus that I have ever heard of growing, including Peyote, but they are far from mature. I slowly came back to baseline while talking to him. <br>
<br>
In all the trip lasted just over 13 hours and was great. One sidenote that I feel I need to make is that one should NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES dose on anything for their first time without a scale to be sure of exact dose. I now believe I may have dosed as much as 30 grams.<!--   End Body   -->

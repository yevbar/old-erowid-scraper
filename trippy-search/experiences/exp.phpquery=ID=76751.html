<!--   Start Body   -->


I have tried this compound twice before at 8mg and 10mg and found both to be good overall, but lacking visually. Hopefully this dose (15mg) will be better. I ate a small meal about an hour ago, so my stomach should now be empty enough to not hinder the performance of this compound too much.<br>
<br>
+ - 0.00 - Ingested 15mg of 2C-B-FLY in a 'bomb' made from half a rolling paper and I'm now making a cup of coffee to speed up the onset and rolling a joint to smoke in half an hour as I find this always enhances other drugs.<br>
<br>
+ - 0.15 -  Some stomach discomfort noted. Nothing serious, just a similar feeling I get after ingesting MDMA. Also, starting to feel the head high and slight euphoria coming on.<br>
<br>
+ - 0.30 - Beginning to feel very communicative, words flow very easily as I write this. Going to smoke the joint now to help bring on the effects.<br>
<br>
+ - 0.45 - The first signs of visuals are appearing. Objects appear to move and ripple very slightly. My sense of time and distance are also beginning to be affected. Time seems to be passing very slowly and simple tasks such as walking and typing are  becomming more difficult. It's time for an old favourite of mine, a movie with the sound turned down and music. * Music sounds much 'bigger' than normal and feels as if it surrounds me.<br>
<br>
+ - 1.00 - I'm starting to feel a bit of stimulation now, I keep finding myself tapping my foot. The visuals and head space are also starting to become slightly more intense. Clouds on the TV appear to be bulging and thinking clearly is becoming difficult. Also noted that music recorded by bands sounds much better to me than electronic music, which is unusual for me on psychedelics. Emotions conveyed in music seem much stronger somehow too. Also, beginning to feel a slight tightness in my chest and shivers reminiscent of piperazines.<br>
<br>
+ - 1.15 - I keep noticing flashes of neon colour in my peripheral vision and colours appear brighter than usual although visuals are still only slight. I gave electronic music another try and it appears to be just as good as (if not, better than) live music. I could see this being a great club drug at this dose.<br>
<br>
+ - 1.30 - Dark DnB is bringing on a strong urge to dance which is worrying as I'm a firm believer that dancing on your own is very, very sad. Overall the effects can be felt much more strongly than with 8-10mg, but this compound still only has a slight psychedelic edge. I will probably allow a week or so to prevent any tolerance issues then try 20-25mg to push for stronger psychedelic effects.<br>
<br>
+ - 2.00 - This chemical is definitely best enjoyed with danceable music. It seems better suited for use as a stimulant than anything else. I feel like I've definately been at a plataeu since the hour point, haven't noticed anything worth mentioning since then. <br>
<br>
...Just as I typed that objects started moving around the screen and I'm starting to notice definate tracers. Also noticing that concentrating on anything for more than a few seconds has definately become more difficult.<br>
<br>
+ - 2.30 - The stimulant effects seem to have subsided and visuals are becoming more intense, this is more like what I was hoping for. Objects are warping, glowing and changing colour slightly. Also, more tracers are appearing. I just spoke to a friend on the phone and it caused quite a lot of confusion, I think I was coherent but the head space has definately intensified. 2C-B-FLY is starting to remind me of its cousin Bromo-DragonFLY at low doses. It's time to ditch danceable music in favour of Shpongle.<br>
<br>
+ - 3.00 - Visuals and head space are both at a nice fairly intense but managable level now. As much as this felt like a great club drug earlier I think it would be easy for things to become overwhelming in that enviroment at this stage, especially for less experienced trippers.<br>
<br>
+ - 4.00 - Both visuals and head space are both still strongly present but starting to dwindle slightly. Lights appear to be emitting neon glows and looking at them is causing brightly coloured spots in my vision, these spots keep moving around and morphing. If I wanted to keep this going I would consider an 5-10mg redose at this point.<br>
<br>
+ - 5.00 - The head space has let up significantly except for brief moments of confusion. I'm still left with subtle visuals and a nice body high.<br>
<br>
+ - 6.00 - I feel almost back to baseline now, I would consider myself fit to drive and feel I will be able to sleep tonight without much trouble.<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
This dose was much more psychedelic than 8-10mg, although it could still have been more visual. I think I will probably try 18-20mg in the near future,  any more and I think the head space would begin to become unmanageable, but we'll see. I still have roughly 85mg left so there's still enough for further experimentation.<!--   End Body   -->

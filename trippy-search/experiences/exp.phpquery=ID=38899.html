<!--   Start Body   -->


As is true with all good trips, set and setting must be noted:<BR>
<BR>
Set: Tired and frustrated because my plans didn’t work out as well as I’d hoped. However, I was also happy because I was about to hang out with some friends and perform in a choir ensemble later in the day. I estimated that I would be coming down from the trip around the time we started singing, based on my past experiences with the drugs. <BR>
<BR>
Setting: 0:00 was in my room, 0:30-4:00 was at a friend’s house, 4:00-7:00 was singing and with choir folks. <BR>
<BR>
I had only slept 5 hours, and had just spent 7 hours at school. I had just gotten some codeine from a like-minded friend of mine, and wanted to try smoking half a pill. I watched him snort half a pill in class, and he asked if I would like to try any. He gave me three pills as a favor, and I wanted to go home and try smoking half, snorting half, and eating half. My hypothesis was that these three methods of ingestion would give me three different peaks, so that I would be feeling the effects stronger, longer. When I got home, though, my mother was there, so I couldn’t smoke anything. I’d wanted to smoke some salvia too, but luck was not on my side. <BR>
<BR>
Through several small attempts (my mother was home so I was quite paranoid) I snorted about ¾ of a pill. I sprinkled the rest of the dust under my tongue and held it there, hoping it might be absorbed sublingually. Then, after washing the horrible taste out of my mouth, I chugged a bottle of Delsym (which had enough Dextromethrophan polistirex to equal about 500mg DXM). This was actually not a bad experience at all: the texture was somewhat syrupy, and it actually tasted something like orange soda. Not a bad experience. <BR>
<BR>
At this point I went downstairs to talk to people online as I waited for my friends to call me. I ended up waiting about forty-five minutes, which turned out to be a good thing. As I sat talking, I put on some Jimi Hendrix and just got lost in the music. Now, this was not an especially druggy sort of “lost”…it was a more common sort of “lost”, the kind I can get when I just really enjoy a song and am in a certain mood. It was just much easier to get lost with the drugs. Anyway, I was talking with a fellow herbalist and I told him about what I had done. He and I have always been very close, and I ended up going on a 15 minute rant about how great a guy he was, and how I was so happy he was my friend. He responded well, so I left very upbeat when my friends came to pick me up. <BR>
<BR>
I suppose before I go on I should explain my history with these two drugs a bit. When I had my tonsils out they gave me hydrocodone with acetaminophen as a liquid. I was able to save a bottle, and the most I ever did was a double dose of it when I wasn’t in pain. The effects were calm euphoria, mild CEVs, and some nausea. I have done cough syrup for regular colds at regular doses. Most I have ever done is a double dose of Nyquil before bed, and I got a very vivid pre-sleep open-eyed visual of a car dashboard. I’ve never done the two together. <BR>
<BR>
Anyway, before I left I took another half pill of codeine (this is about 45 minutes after the first dosing). I also took a hit of nitrous, just to see how it affected me. It made me feel very “primal”. I was cleaning up a spilled glass of water on the floor, and falling to my knees just after I exhaled the nitrous made it feel like the beginning of a song. I groped around on the ground a bit, smiling, feeling like part of some sort of song, head fuzzy and pulsing. This only lasted for about 30 seconds though, at which point I stood up and got some water. <BR>
<BR>
In the passenger seat of the car I noticed I was actually feeling LESS high than I did when I was talking online. This disappointed me. I gave the trip up for lost, assuming that something had gone wrong: maybe my tolerance was too high, or the polistirex version of DXM spread the trip out too much to really enjoy it. Once I got out of the car, though, I really began to feel it. The first thing I noticed was that I flowed out of the car much more naturally than normal. Immediately upon closing the door I noticed I had the “robo-walk.” It was nothing like I thought it would be, though. I thought that this effect meant that movements would be very pronounced and slow, like a robot. I, however, felt very quick and smooth. The part that made it feel robotic was that it felt like my feet were one step ahead from the rest of my body. It almost felt that my whole upper body, down to my knees, was vertical, and then at my knees there was a 90 degree angle, and my jutted out in front of me. Then my shins took another 90 degree turn, and my feet touched the ground, but a foot or so in front of me. In any case, it was a fun affect to experiment with.<BR>
 <BR>
When I got into my friend’s house my girlfriend (who picked me up) grabbed my hand and led me downstairs onto the couch. This was a huge euphoric boost for me; she isn’t normally openly affectionate like that, which made me feel great. Plus, the sort of love that these drugs had been exuding online was still present. I collapsed into her lap, and the “feet leading my body” effect was still happening, except this time it was my torso. When I landed in her lap, it felt like my body actually extended past where I knew it “ended”, so that I actually became one with her. It was a wonderful feeling. We laid and talked, the three of us, until we decided to make a pizza. I found that anything besides laying down brought on nausea, but I didn’t want to alert them to any possibility that I was using drugs, so I kept my mouth shut. I still felt very flowy, like each action was perfect. I did some fun dives and rolls on the carpet, and my friend commented that I looked a lot like a ninja. This made me feel a bit better: at least my motions weren’t affected enough for anyone else to tell. <BR>
<BR>
Codiene nausea is a weird sort of nausea. It feels almost entirely emotional. It seems like it takes place in a part of me that isn’t associated with any particular organ. It is hard to explain… Anyway, after pizza I went home to change into my tuxedo. My nausea was gone, but now the “leading myself” feeling was a lot stronger. It wasn’t as mentally pronounced as it is when I smoke marijuana. When I smoke, I get the feeling that as I do an action, the next 3 seconds of action are prescripted, almost so I don’t have to think about them. With codeine and DXM, it felt like my body just extended a foot or so in front of me, so that I was about 3 body widths wide instead of just one. “Out of body experience”? I don’t think so, but it was certainly interesting. <BR>
<BR>
Once I was all dressed up and waiting to perform, it started to hit me harder. No doubt this was because of the stress involved in singing for an audience at ALL, much less when I am under the influence. I got in the back row in an attempt to avoid much eye contact. As soon as I started singing I felt the sensation that my head had become stuffed with cotton. Sounds were somewhat muffled, and my own voice sounded very dull, without any vibrancy. It almost felt like the air got thicker. (Theoretically, this makes sense…all those voices filling a normally silent room with noise could have a similar tactile “filling” feeling.) This was an uncomfortable feeling: I couldn’t hear myself, so it was hard to alter my voice for the better. When we got done and I got in the car I felt all better. Apparently the stress of singing took all the effects I had been feeling and compounded them into one performance. <BR>
<BR>
Looking back on this trip, I realize that I used the same thought processes to guide myself as I do for drugs like salvia and weed. There is a chain of questions that leads up to the most influential piece of internal dialogue that I go through when tripping:<BR>
<BR>
Can others tell that I'm high? If so, how can I hide the physical symptoms? Am I stuttering more than normal? What is my excuse if I cannot hide any of the effects? Will it be better to look someone in the eye and risk the chance of them seeing anything bad, or averting my eyes and arousing suspicion?<BR>
<BR>
Can I answer all these questions correctly? If not, can I make up for it?<BR>
<BR>
Can I keep answering these questions for as long as it is necessary? When will I give up?<BR>
<BR>
Could I live like this forever?<BR>
<BR>
Normally, upon reaching that last question, my mind is decided on whether or not I will have a good trip or a bad trip. Now, with this trip people commented that I looked natural without even knowing I was under the influence. Nobody questioned me, I wasn’t around ANY figures of authority (in fact, I was around a lot of like-minded people who could help cover for me), and I realized that, if I needed to, I could live like that forever. All of these things combined into a great euphoric trip. The last hour was a bit tedious…I had just finished singing, I could decide if I felt sick or hungry, and the “leading myself” effect turned more into a “throbbing head” effect. But all in all, I think it is an experience I would repeat (assuming I could sit on my ass the whole time).<!--   End Body   -->

Let's skip the insignificant details. the stuff arrived and i already had a brewing recipe, so my first step was to bring 5 quarts of water to a boil, add 4 ounces of caapi vine, 2 ounces of chacruna foliage, and a generous amount of lemon and lime extract. boiled for 2 1/2 hours, until the water level was fairly small, drained the fluids and used the cooked foliage to make another brew out of 4 quarts of water. boiled that for another 2 1/2 hours and then combined to the extracts and boiled for maybe 40 minutes with the foliage still inside. then i put the concoction in the fridge to let it cool down and steep at about 35 degrees overnight.  the next day at noon, i put the concoction back to boil for about an hour, then i separated the foliage from the fluids, boiled the fluids alone to make a small amount so as to only have to ingest a small amount. made a third very small extract out of the leftover foliage so as to catch whatever substances still lingered, added it to the extract and boiled it down. DONE. it had boiled down to about 2 full glasses of yage. <BR>
<BR>
i lit a patchouli incense, and turned all the lights off i let it cool down and then started sipping little by little and heres my experience at recorded time intervals:<BR>
<BR>
4:30 pm--took 2 big sips of the brew. i wanted to span out the brew so as to reduce nausea. <BR>
<BR>
4:45 pm--took 2 big sips. i noticed that with each sip, the bitterness becomes more and more intense.<BR>
<BR>
4:50 pm--started to drink faster. took more like 6 sips in a row, still noticing increased bitterness. by the time i get to the bottom, i just might throw up it seems.<BR>
<BR>
5:00 pm--finished off the first cup, the second cup was supposed to be for my room mate deanne, she was napping at the time. <BR>
<BR>
5:05 pm--noticed i felt a little floaty and was wondering around the house doing a peculiar little dance, solely out of boredom.<BR>
<BR>
5:10 pm--sat down at the computer and turned on Lateralus and put it on #10 and switched on the windows ME media player visuals and sat there, waiting for the effects to become stronger. when Maynard started off, 'mention this to me...mention this to me...watch the weather change' i experienced a pleasure tingle/shiver rush from my head to my toes and like 4 tears forced themselves down my face. i felt silly, but my emotions were just so sensitive, and the song had such deep meaning to me.<BR>
<BR>
5:20 pm--definitely noticing an acid-like come on, colors becoming more vivid, thoughts beginning to race, emotions heightened as if i was on XTC. i was somewhat lonely though since i was by myself on this journey. but i was enjoying it nonetheless. i decided to smoke the salvia extract i got for free from my supplier: i loaded the pipe with a generous amount and took a hit. the first one wasn't too intense, yet more intense with the help of the yage. the music seemed like it was part of the air, like it was something that was always heard as a normal ongoing thing. it also made me feel like it might be an auditory hallucination. like it was all in my head. i took a second hit and a weird but mild thing happened. my brain started thinking as if it was someone else controlling my thoughts and each thought lead to another thought that had nothing to with the previous thought, and it felt like my thoughts were made of physical matter, and they were simply pulsing and multiplying in sort of a 'branching off' concept. <BR>
<BR>
i took 2 more hits, one right after another and my eyes started darting from one area of the room to another, and it wasn't me making those decisions, they were doing it on their own. tracers were beginning to overwhelm me, and i felt like gravity was sucking me down, so i stumbled to my bed and i lay down, close my eyes and the music takes over. behind my eyelids, i could see the music as a pulsing matter threatening to engulf me. i hesitated for a second, then i willed it to swallow me, and it did just that. the pulsing matter became larger and closer and more real and then it had surrounded my entire enitity and was then squeezing me, and pulsing against my physicality and it felt as if it was digesting me because i was slowly moving downward as if traveling through an intestine. something possessed me and split my entity in half, so one half was simply laying down on the bed, catatonic, and the other half was engulfed in beautiful, physical music matter. <BR>
<BR>
that half became one with the music and i just flowed through the matter and indulged. i was tranced out in that state for and hour and ten minutes. the CD had ended when i came out of the trance, it was as if the music WAS the trance, and it ceased to oscilate so i ceased to trance. <BR>
<BR>
6:40 pm--i got out of bed and instantly noticed rapidly changing colors throughout my room, and peripheral hallucinations and a feeling of wholeness, as if my soul had just been cleansed thoroughly and effectively. the music purified me! i went to the mirror to take a look at my pupils and they were saucers of course! <BR>
<BR>
i wondered around the house and found myself asking myself questions about my life, and i was able to answer each and every question i asked. it was as if everything made sense finally. i felt like i was on a mild candyflip, with a few extra entities present. i showed the yage spirit so much respect ever since i discovered it in literature, that in return, the spirit emitted 3 times the respect. i never purged, of course i had no toxins in my body, not even pot or alcohol, i had quit smoking pot a month prior and alcohol 4 days prior. i had been taking vitamins every day for a while too. on top of that i fasted all day before the experience. no breakfast, no lunch. <BR>
<BR>
7:00 pm--i took 3 more hits of salvia and decided to save the rest, concluding that i smoked about a 1/4 of the gram that i have. i spanned the 3 hits through about 15 minutes so i didn't really go back into the pulsing music vessel, though i caught a very vivd outside glimpse of it. <BR>
<BR>
7:20 pm--went outside and the nature of the neighborhood, trees, flowers, vines, etc, looked like works of art. the colors stood out as if the most talented artist had sculptured them with alien colors and alien material. the biggest smile on my face, on the verge of giggling out of overwhelming pleasure, i walked around the block and touched just about every piece of plantlife on the block. it was an urge that needed to be fulfilled. i felt as if the yage had entirely destroyed all negativity within me and replaced it with nothing but positivity. until about... <BR>
<BR>
8:00 pm--i was just frying and exploring and wandering around, lost in my own little world. then Deanne woke up and i told her all about it. she looked at me as if i had just told her that aliens gave me an anal probe. she thought i had gone off the deep end, which i probably did, but i enjoyed it nonetheless.<BR>
<BR>
8:30 pm--the effects still lingered, but i was coming down, yet i still looked at each piece of my vision as a fascinating peice of art.<BR>
<BR>
8:45 pm--deanne decided to head to the store for groceries and beer, so obviously i would be the one drinking her cup of the brew since she chose beer instead.<BR>
<BR>
9:30 pm--we arrive back home, and i put the groceries away for her, and proceed to drink her half of the brew. we turned on the TV and jumped into the middle of Panic Room.<BR>
<BR>
9:55 pm--sitting on the chair, lost in the movie, i returned to reality for a second only to find that the position my body was in didn't match with the position i felt i was in, like my body was leaning back but i was leaning forward. i felt like my body was slowly becoming part of the air as well until i sat up out of exhilaration. suddenly i wanted to go for a walk, so as to free my mind, discover answers to questions that were eating at me all of a sudden, and to expand my view on the world while i was intoxicated by this cleansing spirit-like entity. it was dark, and i was walking faster than hell for reasons unknown. i walked and i walked and i walked, with no destination. i just walked all throughout the town, fast paced, discman on low volume, cellphone in hand. i walked non stop, totally indulged in my heightened existance and vivid visuals and emotional wholeness. when i got back home, it seemed like i literally was gone for like 3 or 4 hours, yet it was only...<BR>
<BR>
11:00 pm--that last hour i guess was my peak, and i loved every second of it. i started coming down as soon as i walked in the door. it was as if the direct exposure to the night air had brought out the beauty of my soul. or the fact that i was walking super fast might have sped up my metabolism, making the peak a little stronger yet a little shorter. i was revived, like i had asked of the spirit before i even drank the brew, before i even obtained the ingredients. i was healed, like i had asked. i had all my questions answered, like i had asked. and last but not least, my other half showed up drunk and horny, just like i had asked, teehee. and that was my first trip to yageland, and i would like to recomend it to anyone who is not just looking for another psychedelic, but simply a positive experience. show respect for the spirit, and you will get it in return 3-fold. if you want to fry, pick mushrooms, this is different, this is medicine. and it has a soul...<!--   End Body   -->

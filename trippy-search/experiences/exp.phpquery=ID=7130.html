I had already been trippin on the cough syrup for about 5 or 6 hours.  Me and two friends were chillin in his apartment and we get a call from his neighbor saying, 'Hey man i ordered this Salvia divinorum shit and it doesn't even work. do you want it?' My friend immediately left and came right back with a handful of Salvia extract.  I watch him load a bowl in the 2 ft bong.  He took 1 fat hit, then another. then he smiled and handed me the bong. He stared off into the air and actually started drooling. I thought he was messing around. I asked him if he felt it and he tried to talk but a blob of drool fell out of his mouth.  A few minutes later he came back to earth and said 'I cant believe this shit is legal!'<BR>
<BR>
I loaded a bowl for myself and took a big hit, held it. Then another, and held it.  I handed my friend the bong.  I remember certain spots on my body feel like they were being pushed to the right with a lot of force. I almost actually moved along with it. Then I became really confused. I forgot where I was and who my two friends were. i could see their faces but everything around it seemed to sort of melt to the right side like a Jacob's ladder. Pretty crazy. I remember my friend saying 'Is it working?' and it was sooooo hard for me to spit out the word yes. I said it really slow. Then finally I looked around the room and figured out where I was. I looked at the bong in my friends hand then I remembered what happened.  <BR>
<BR>
This was the most intense trip ever. the peak was probably about 5 minutes. i would love to get some more of this.  this was a great experience and i think potheads and mushroom fans would dig it.<!--   End Body   -->

Dose: 10-15 mg 5meo-dmt (insufflated)<BR>
Onset: 4 min<BR>
<BR>
Background:  This report comes from my fourth try.  The first time was freebased and too intense to really accurately describe.  The second was insufflated and too weak of a dose.  The third was freebased and much more pleasent as I knew what to except and was able to better enjoy my self.  I have no access to a scale so I just went up a little from before too be safe I wasn’t doing too much.  The amount this time is around 10-15 mg based on the feelings and sensations I got.  I did this drug in a car on the way back from a very fun road trip.  I am very content and comfortable with everyone in the car, so I don’t expect and anxiety or paranoia, which I sometimes get when with people I’m not familiar with.<BR>
<BR>
The powder was crushed and sorted into 2 lines one for each nostril.  <BR>
Nasal drip is hell in the nose and throat, it could be compared to someone holding you upside down and putting acid in your nose through a dripper.  This pain prevented me from any productive thoughts.  The pain eventually did not matter as much, and I was able to start writing. <BR>
<BR>
Strange urging to write: <BR>
“Knowledge is power. <BR>
The power is only mental though.<BR>
If you have knowledge and the will power to ride this intense wave then you have power over your mind. <BR>
This knowledge is obtained through research.”<BR>
<BR>
Everything becomes very clear and understandable.  My thoughts are channeled into ONE.  My mental energy is through the roof, very confident in my thoughts now at about 10 min after onset.  I am having those genius thoughts that make so much sense but then flee, like a shooting stars brilliant cascade then its subsequent disappearance, yet you don’t forget on 5meo-dmt.  I feel like I am at a peak in my mental capacity.  <BR>
<BR>
There are very little visuals, nothing profound.  Things have a strange aura to them.  Light is dimmed at some moments then heightened at others.  I don’t explore this aspect of the trip much as the mental candy is much more interesting.<BR>
<BR>
My body also feels much more sensitive too touch and cold or hot air.  The air conditioning jet is pointed right at me and feels blissful. <BR>
<BR>
The trip winds down with little residual effects at about 30 min, other then the moderate euphoria I attach to a complete 5meodmt trip.  I read my thoughts, and reflect.<!--   End Body   -->

There is no need for blind faith when you can experience that in which you believe.<BR>
<BR>
We were to pay the Head a visit; before departing: two of us consumed a brew, carefully prepared a few days earlier:<BR>
<BR>
I had taken 14 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds and crushed them, leaving them to soak in boiled water before straining the liquid through an old t-shirt – Separating the none soluble, stomach-irritating fats, from the water-soluble psychoactive amide – being LSA, the naturally occurring precursor to LSD. Shared the tea with one other person.<BR>
<BR>
I have some experience with the seeds and was expecting to peak in about three hours, to reach a mellow plateau from which I could soak in the surroundings.<BR>
<BR>
An effigy of Buddha meditated on the brew as it brewed.<BR>
<BR>
After a beautiful five mile cycle along the beach, we reach Hengistbury Head. We rise to the top as the sun sets deeper, casting fantastic reds & oranges into our atmosphere. <BR>
<BR>
The third member of our group ingests roughly 80mg of MDMA.<BR>
In a place like the Head you could experience euphoria without ever adding extra chemicals to the swirling pool already you. We decide not to without ever making the decision…<BR>
<BR>
One moment rolls on, before our eyes the intense beauty of day morphs to a beauty more subtle.<BR>
<BR>
In the moment.<BR>
<BR>
We lie a top the Head, a mellow plateau, sitting one hundred and eighteen feet above sea level…<BR>
Upside down, near the edge and all I can see is Sea,<BR>
And Sky!<BR>
And the curve of the Earth!!<BR>
<BR>
In the moment.<BR>
<BR>
The sky darkens, the wind chills…<BR>
We cover ourselves in a blanket plenty big enough for three.<BR>
<BR>
In the moment.<BR>
<BR>
The curtains are drawn back and we are allowed to gaze upon the greatest show on Earth,<BR>
The Universe…<BR>
We look out from a point.<BR>
We travel.<BR>
<BR>
In the moment.<BR>
<BR>
Three highs become one, then many.<BR>
<BR>
I lose myself in the stars, the longer I gaze upon them – the more I see.<BR>
The only times I slip back from ecstasy are the times I tell myself:<BR>
<BR>
‘It’s happening’<BR>
Response:<BR>
‘I don’t need to know thanks, I’m already there.’<BR>
<BR>
Sitting here, writing this –<BR>
I am confronted by a memory in a different category to those recalling ‘everyday experience’. A memory less focused on what happened, more on what I felt. A memory that is crystal clear but open to suggestion, a living memory that I know still has the power to teach me…<BR>
I felt what happened,<BR>
It felt a bit like this…<BR>
<BR>
LOVE<BR>
<BR>
I’m unreasonably happy.<BR>
I’m filled with the most intense Love I have ever felt.<BR>
Mad, directionless Love that flows out of me as it flows in:<BR>
It blows through me as the wind blows over…<BR>
And I have a feeling that, like the wind, its movement is circular.<BR>
<BR>
As I lose consciousness of my body, I too become Love…<BR>
And I move with it.<BR>
<BR>
Having experienced such Love, and all it inspires. I cannot doubt that God exists,<BR>
For I have known God in his purest manifestation, God as Love: <BR>
And so I realise that God is Love, the very same force –<BR>
That which inspires creation.<BR>
That which creates creation!<BR>
<BR>
The Human experience of LoveGod, known to lie behind the words of the term ‘Mystical experience’, is both old & new, eternal & transient:<BR>
It is a fountain that human beings have been swimming in and drinking of as long as we have been apart – And we have always been a part…<BR>
LoveGod:<BR>
<BR>
The illicit truth of every Religion.<BR>
A muse that inspires the whole Human race.<BR>
The source of all existence – <BR>
As simultaneously spiritual and material beings, not only is our Consciousness born from it, Our Body as well.<BR>
<BR>
My hand is inexorably linked to thoughts of my hand. <BR>
He is an expression of my consciousness, of its will to reach out…<BR>
To Touch.<BR>
<BR>
One cannot exist without the Other because: One and the Other are One and the same. <BR>
<BR>
LoveGod is a paradox, being every word we utter and the gaps in between – <BR>
Explained equally inadequately by ‘Good & Evil’, ‘Negative & Positive’,<BR>
Simultaneously both and neither –<BR>
It is being in the same moment as becoming, it never began and it still hasn’t ended…<BR>
<BR>
And so we find ‘The Human Condition’:<BR>
<BR>
I grow within<BR>
And on this strange world:<BR>
An impossible tapestry,<BR>
They try to unfurl.<BR>
<BR>
Without knowing what to ask,<BR>
They question each thread:<BR>
Does it start when I’m born?<BR>
Does it end when I’m dead?<BR>
<BR>
I grow within<BR>
And on this strange land:<BR>
An impossible tapestry,<BR>
Woven of its own hand.<BR>
<BR>
Don’t search for the answer,<BR>
For the answer will come.<BR>
Stand back far enough:<BR>
Two merge into One.<BR>
<BR>
And so we find the Human race:<BR>
<BR>
In our relentless search for the ‘answer’ (which is so ridiculously simple no-one stands a chance of comprehending it) we have neglected the beauty of all that provokes question.<BR>
<BR>
And so we find ourselves…<BR>
<BR>
There is nothing as perfect for now as the ecstasy of the infinite question:<BR>
The eternal involvement of self with other; finding out without asking a thing.<BR>
A passive exchange of energies, of information… <BR>
<BR>
If we concentrate on pursuing the answer, as opposed to cultivating a passive acceptance of the fact that the answer is immanent, we do ourselves no favours…<BR>
<BR>
First: We miss out on the ecstasy of the infinite question, in other words –<BR>
We do not gain full enjoyment from our involvement with the outside and the inside worlds;<BR>
This involvement is to be marvelled at, celebrated, cherished and explored…<BR>
<BR>
Second: As we dream of ‘the most sacred thing’, we neglect the fact that everything is sacred.<BR>
This, combined with an unawareness of the inter-connectedness of all things, has contributed to the widespread destruction of our Mother Earth, Gaia:<BR>
<BR>
She is our Garden yet we trample her plants and slaughter her animals, we suffocate her skin with a layer of concrete, pollute the air she breathes and the water she drinks with our foul concoctions…<BR>
<BR>
She is our Garden, the tree is our life – and we still forbid our children free run of her fruits…<BR>
<BR>
How I yearn for free run of her fruits…<BR>
<BR>
The Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds I consumed belong to a family of Gaias fruits termed ‘Entheogen’ meaning ‘God Within’:<BR>
<BR>
Many Entheogens having been helping Human beings find LoveGod since we first looked outside of meat for food. They are gifts –<BR>
First from God,<BR>
Then from Our Planet.<BR>
<BR>
There is nothing less human about looking to nature for ‘Mind food’ than there is about looking to nature for ‘Body food’ –<BR>
Yet the former lies well behind in the acceptance stakes – At least in so far as many Societies, with their Governments and Religions, are concerned.<BR>
<BR>
*  *  *  *  *<BR>
<BR>
The ‘drugs’ had worn off.<BR>
<BR>
We emerged from the woods, into which we had retreated after our Mystical experience a top the cliff, and lay once more under the blanket.<BR>
The sound of the Sea, its partner the wind thankfully absent, soothed us to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
I awoke cold & damp but energised & joyous.<BR>
Climbing back up the Head in order to reach the warming rays of the morning Sun, I was sent two messages – arriving as thoughts…<BR>
<BR>
The first, from God, said:<BR>
<BR>
‘No-one dies.’<BR>
<BR>
The second, from Our Planet, said:<BR>
<BR>
‘It’s not too late.’<BR>
<BR>

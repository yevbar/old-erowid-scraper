<!--   Start Body   -->


Ever since the year started, I had been in a very dark place emotionally. A lot has been happening that is out of my control and has been injecting a lot of negativity into my life. I therefore abstained from taking any psychedelics this month. I have been stabilizing this last week, but I was determined to make it to Jan. 31st without taking any psychedelics. Well, as it turns out, I had been working on a book for my Mediterranean Studies class, and I was going to read it again in order to make a few connections. You have to understand that this is not an ordinary story – I doubt the author wrote it while sober. In case you are interested, the book is <i>Quarantine</i> by Juan Goytisolo. I wanted to read it the second time under the influence of a psychedelic. But waiting for Jan. 31st would mean dangerously approaching the deadline without having anything written down. And so, I have decided, on Jan 29th (the day of this report), to take a tiny dose of LSD and read at least half of the book while under the influence.<BR>
<BR>
The day started with dosing my (somewhat new) regular regimen: 50mg 5HTP, 500mg L-Phenylalanine, and a Multivitamin tablet. I also decided to take 40mg of Gingko for no reason at all. The idea was to experiment with LSD via rectal administration. I was originally blessed with a 10-tab sheet of <i>powerful</i> blotter. I had previously taken half a tab sublingually, and enjoy a beautiful trip, by no means light. My ONLY problem with this magical substance is that it last way too damn long – I found myself exhausted (both physically and mentally) at the end of this trip. I have encountered the same problem with 2C-E. And so, I took the remaining half of the aforementioned tab, and cut that in half, giving me a quarter of tab. I decided to aim low – just in case. I was not aiming for a full-blown LSD trip, I was aiming for a semi-psychedelic mindspace to aid me with the book, and also to see how rectal administration would alter the LSD experience.<BR>
<BR>
And so I take the quarter rectally at around 12:30pm. Usually, if I have a psychedelic in powder form I would dissolve it in water and take it as a microenema. But this was a *tiny* piece of paper. After a lot of work, I managed to actually get it in. I noticed that the onset was actually immediate – right after I finished washing my hands I started to feel off-baseline. However, the climb to the peak was just as slow as with sublingual administration – it took a total of a bit more than an hour since ingestion for me to be fully immersed in it. As I waited for the climb, I decided to rid myself of all sexual energy by masturbation.<BR>
<BR>
Wow. This quarter rectally is about as strong as half a tab sublingually! In fact, I was surprised. I found there is a lot of stimulation – I found myself walking around the house aimlessly. There was a bit of a body load, but I attribute that to all the emotional stress from the previous month. There were no visuals to write home about – which is similar to my previous trip with half a blotter. But my thoughts were rushing at an amazing speed. I also felt great. Just like last time, LSD seems to give a very nice mood lift – but one which does not prevent me from flushing out negative emotions and experience them fully. That is the beauty of LSD.<BR>
<BR>
I was walking aimlessly with thoughts rushing, and I suddenly stood in my living room, closed my eyes, and vibrated, “IIIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOO”. My voice was fantastic – perfect, consistent vibration. I was drenched with beautiful coloured light, and my body felt energized and I even twitched a bit. I felt so spiritually charged. At this point I decided I was in a good mindset to take that divine sacrament… DPT. Hmm…<BR>
<BR>
I also still had the novel on my mind. I decided that my current peak, DPT or not, was a bit too intense to allow for reflective reading. So I decided to do two things in one. I have always wondered how psychedelics and opiates mix, and thought that the opiates will calm me down for the latter part of the trip to allow me to focus on the novel. And so my plan was set!<BR>
<BR>
I had a few decent-sized dried poppy pods lying around (for decoration, of course), and so I took seven of them, ground them up, and boiled in water and a bit of lemon juice. Strain, boil again, strain, boil again, strain. Now I have a glass of bitter honey-coloured nectar. Hey, why not. Lets add honey. And that was a great move – the honey made it taste actually pleasurable. Down goes the poppy tea. There is a lesson to be learned when drinking poppy tea. Even if I use a coffee filter, there will always be some sediment at the bottom of the cup. The tea can be downed smoothly, but if I happen to get some of the sediment in my throat, it’ll trigger a gag reflex. Gluttony, tsk tsk tsk. Just don’t drink all the way to the bottom. Leave that tiny bit of liquid and sediment for the sewer faeries to drink – its not like its going to make such a difference in the effects.<BR>
<BR>
Now with the poppy tea down, I know it takes about 2 hours to even start to take effect, the plan was set: I take the DPT, have a huge peak along with the LSD peak, come down from the DPT just as the opium was peaking, and use the peacefulness of opiates with the mindspace of psychedelics to analyze my novel. So, I run and prepare myself a miniature mound of DPT. In all honesty, I actually have no idea how much it is, but I am sure it is more than 100mg and less than 200mg, judging from the total amount of sacrament that I originally had. It did not matter. I find that above 100mg, the trip is intense anyway and 50mg difference does not affect the trip much. The battle between nose and rectum ensues: should I snort it, or should I plug it? I decided on snorting it, then going for a shower and letting the vapour help my nose. For some reason, snorting it this time created a very violent reaction in my olfactory system – I just couldn’t go on. Perhaps my nose was too clear? I was able to insufflate only about a quarter of the total to be taken. So, I decided that I will take the rest rectally, and I did.<BR>
<BR>
I then went into the shower anyway. I must note that by this time my conception of time was totally off. Adding the DPT certainly did not help. I actually have no idea how many hours had passed since I took the LSD, but if my memory is correct, my watch had the fat arrow at the 4pm position. As I “showered” (it was a big effort), I realized that my mind – the LSD peak – has actually calmed down! But I knew that I was still peaking on LSD since showering had become an art and a science. From my experience, high doses of DPT have an effect of “the calm before the storm.” I realized, as “time” passed on, that I was feeling a “gravity” pulling me upwards. Interesting. During the middle ages, certain types of Sufi mystics were referred to as “Mjdhub” (s/he who is pulled by (God’s) gravity). This was used to refer to some wandering mystics who were either actually psychotic, or had Hashish as part of their meals, or both. I find that interesting since DPT always creates a sense of God-intoxication in me, and that is why I consider it sacred.<BR>
<BR>
Now I was in the shower being pulled upwards. I was beginning to feel the DPT vibrations and my visual field was starting to become not-so-normal. I decide it is time to step (float) out of the shower. I manage to dry myself and put on some clothes, and then lie on my bed just in time when the music starts and I am blown away into divinity.<BR>
<BR>
Lets see what we have for music… two servings of Enigma and The Mars Volta, with a hint of Muse and a dash of Radiohead. Perfect. I do not remember much of what happens next. I was lost. My jaws were rattling at OM speed in the typical DPT manner. I remember looking at the ceiling, and then seeing it shatter into particles to reveal a white (sometimes with a purple hue) light that permeated through and dissolved me in it. So much light! This is too divine… I would then snap out of it and get lost again in something else. Music was distorted in the most beautiful alien way. It seems like I could “transfer” pieces of music from one part of the track to the other. I could also “stretch” certain parts. Not only did I die, but I had fun doing it, especially that now I was beginning to lie on a bed of poppies. The tea was starting to kick in.<BR>
<BR>
I then walked around, basking in the DPT afterglow. I noticed that there were muffled voices coming out of my speakers. I have no idea if this was a hallucination, or if it was a strong radio wave being picked up by the speakers. I suspect it is the latter, even though it never happened before. I have noticed that my body starts creating some electromagnetic disturbances as a reaction to the DPT experience. Lights and animals behave funny around me, and sometimes I pick up other people’s thoughts and feelings. I called my friend and tried to make a conversation with him about the voices on my speakers (I was still hearing them). The conversation was very hard, and I kept laughing at myself. I told him I will talk to him later when I am more coherent. He said I sounded perfectly normal, but in my mind, I was not. For some reason, the phrase “La Voix des vents” got stuck in my mind. I do not know why. It sounds so beautiful when pronounced properly. I finally recognized it as the title of a painting by Rene Magritte. I have not thought of Magritte since my short-lived high school crush on surrealism… But I looked up the painting, and found it very expressive of my state of mind.<BR>
<BR>
Another interesting thing happened shortly after. I had what I think was a sprained ankle for the past week. It was beginning to heal and I was feeling some numbness at the spot (but no pain). At this time, it seems like the psychedelics exaggerated the numbness whenever I felt it, and at one point I felt like my foot was becoming gangrenous or something. This alarmed me much – but I managed to get my mind out of it by soaking it in warm water and then going out for a walk. No, make that going out for a <i>float</i> on the pavement. It’s a good warning though: not to take psychedelics if one has a physical ailment, because it will be exaggerated if it takes some attention.<BR>
<BR>
The transition from LSD to DPT and back was very smooth. The synergy is golden. My only problem was that the energy from the DPT descent (normally pleasant) mixed with LSD’s energy to create too much energy that was not allowing me to experience the poppies fully. And so I decided to solve the problem with 0.5mg of Clonazepam sublingually. It worked like a charm. Now I was in the exact mindset that I aimed for: Opiate serenity and psychedelic mind-expansion. I was also able to feel LSD’s presence despite the Opiates and the benzos, and I was also able to detect it leaving. I would say the LSD was fully gone at T+8 hours, with the peak easing up at ~T+5 hours. Perfect! with sublingual administration, LSD lasted more than 12 hours!<BR>
<BR>
Of course, the other drugs I took with it might have very well affected its duration, and I will probably be experimenting with the same amount rectally in the future without combining it with anything else. However, I was very glad to have fulfilled all the goals I set for this day. I read half the novel, and made more connections than I would have by reading it 5 times over while sober. Suddenly, much of it made much more sense. By the way, I do recommend this novel for fellow psychedelics users. I stayed awake, covered in a warm poppy blanket until about 1am, when I took 9mg of Melatonin and slept very well to wake up refreshed and full of wonderful ideas for the essay I am going to write.<!--   End Body   -->

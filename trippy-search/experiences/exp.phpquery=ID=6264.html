Last night I took a pill that I knew to be 'real' ecstacy (i. e. MDMA, MDA, or MDE) at a party.  This experience was noticeably different in many ways from all of my previous ecstacy experiences, and I suspect that this may have actually been my first experience with MDA.<BR>
<BR>
---Setting<BR>
<BR>
I went to the party in a happy, energetic mood and had been doing lots of dancing and eagerly awaiting the D+B that I crave.  Earlier in the day, I had taken 30 mg. of Adderall (Dexedrine and Benzedrine) to do some homework, and it had probably worn off but been replaced by the party energy I was working up.<BR>
<BR>
---12:30 (T+0 hrs.)<BR>
<BR>
I eat my pill.  It is a white, hard, roll, about the size of a double-stack, marked 'XTC'.  It is slightly speckled, and has the definite bitter taste of ecstacy.  I had gotten the pill for free by going out and buying some for some girls at my school, who had told me that this was one of the 'best pills they had ever taken', so I was awaiting a great roll.<BR>
<BR>
---T+1 hrs.<BR>
<BR>
Normally by this time I am blowing up or rolling balls.  My typical experience with XTC is that from 30 to 45 minutes after taking the pill, I am feeling nothing, and then the entire effect of it descends on me over a 5-minute span (blowing up).  However, at this point I am feeling nothing.<BR>
<BR>
---T+1 1/2 hrs.<BR>
<BR>
I start yawning noticeably and taking deep breaths.  I am expecting to blow up, but instead I feel the effects of the roll creep up on me over the next 30 minutes; there is no rush, but rather a steady increase in effect.  It is at this point that I start to feel 'smacky'; i. e. it is hard to keep my eyes open at times, the nystagmus (eye fluttering) is insane, and I want to lie down; I leave for the chill room and almost fall asleep.<BR>
<BR>
---T+2 hrs.<BR>
<BR>
I am definitely 'rolling' at this point, but it is different from every other time I have rolled.  First of all, my energy has completely disappeared, and I spend the next one and a half hours with my eyes closed propped up against a wall.  At several times, I try to dance, but usually find that I am not 'feeling' it and don't have the energy, and end up sitting down shortly.  The empathogenic/entactogenic feelings that I associate with MDMA are also missing, and I feel more 'fucked up' with an intense body buzz and psychedelic head-trip than rolly/lovey, but I am definitely rolling.<BR>
<BR>
It is at this point that I notice the psychedelic effects of this pill; I am getting minor acid-style visuals (flowing surfaces, visual noise in the forms of dots and lines and flashes, slightly 'digitized' appearance to surfaces) and also the afterburn effect that I associate with E (i. e. I close my eyes and the image slowly fades over a few seconds).  Also, I start to notice that although I can not dance to the D+B, I am feeling it in almost the identical way that I do while on LSD, i. e. I am breaking the individual beats and basslines down in my head, literally dissecting the music and becoming utterly entranced in it, although all I can do is sit back and bob my head rhythmically.<BR>
<BR>
---T+3 1/2 hrs.<BR>
<BR>
The smacky feelings have disappeared, to be replaced by a sudden rush of amphetamine effect.  The visuals and psychedelic activity are still going strong, and I begin to notice the happy vibes I normally associate with E that had been missing over the last two hours.  I spend the next hour getting back into the vibe of the party and doing some dancing.  When I speak of happy vibes, I mean not the empathogenic qualities (still missing), but that I am feeling vibrant and social, laughing and smiling quite a bit.<BR>
<BR>
---T+4 1/2 hrs.<BR>
<BR>
This is quite interesting.  We leave the party early (against my wishes) because my friend has contracted 'raver disease' (runny nose, headache, etc.) and can not stand staying in the venue any longer.  While driving back to the city, I notice that I am feeling much like the giddy come-on to acid.  When I look back on everything, it was all a logical progression, but at this point I am very speedy (talking fast, etc.) and quite giddy, cracking lots of jokes and laughing hysterically, and just generally having a good time.  The minor visuals and a minor body buzz are still here; the general effect = happy + tweaking.<BR>
<BR>
---T+5 1/2 hrs.<BR>
<BR>
Once in the city, we stop for coffee.  My appetite is practically nonexistent, but I am downing coffee and cigarettes like a madman.  I am still cracking lots of jokes, and really getting along with these two people who had accompanied us whom I hadn't known before.  I also have the rolly eyes I sometimes see on ravers, i. e. dilated and wide open, almost like a staring zombie, accompanied by a giddy smile.<BR>
<BR>
---T+6 hrs.<BR>
<BR>
I get home, and I am basically feeling a warm amphetamine effect with the same minor visuals.  I still don't feel 'cracked out', but rather that most of the effects have simply gone away.  As a precaution, I take several 5-HTP pills to help cushion the impact of the pill, and take a large amount of kava-kava to get to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
---T+14 hrs.<BR>
<BR>
I wake up, and I spend the rest of the day somewhat drained, but certainly not depressed... more surreal insomnia-style with mild giddiness, and I can still call up visuals on certain surfaces if I stare for long enough.<BR>
<BR>
---My conclusions:<BR>
<BR>
I inferred that the pill I had taken was MDA.  Several of the things that I had noticed have been identical to things I have read in MDA trip reports and abstracts; initial smackiness and powerful nystagmus, lack of empathogenic qualities, followed by amphetamine effects, and all of this combined with minor acid-like visual and mind effects.  If anyone has ever taken any of these pills or has some input, I would appreciate it.<!--   End Body   -->

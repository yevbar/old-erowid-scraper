Attention be carefull when taking this drug it is very dangerous. I did not think so till I experienced it for myself. I knew I would trip so I got mentally prepared for this trip since i had it planned for a week or so. I made sure I had no bad thoughts or emotions. My friend had picked the plant in a near by neighborhood where it grows. Who knows how he found out. <BR>
<BR>
It was about 3:00 in the afternoon when I visited him. He had already prepared the tea and chilled it in the refrigerator. (Attention plz have someone sober if u attempt this drug) I was stupid and did not have a sober friend. well anyways it didnt hit me for a while till i puffed a bowl or two around 3:50 or so. I felt kinda weird like I was a fake doll or something it was weird I cant explain the felling. I had mild tracers and weird body fellings. <BR>
<BR>
4:50 I was trippin (I swear this drug I now name is called the memory drug) It brought back past memory as if i replayed them. No LIE this is so so weird. I have never had quite the experience. My friend was no longer there and later on found him trippin hard in the bathroom all out of control. I swear I remember when I was at the beach and i really really felt like I was there. No messin around im serious. What im sayin seems to be hard to believe but I actually was tripiin that hard. A half an hour felt like 2 months. Who knows what the hell i could of been doin. I remember i thought i was in a ambulance when I laid down on the couch. i saw people and talked to my relatives for hours.  <BR>
<BR>
7:00 still talkin to my relatives and reliving past memories and opening doors thinking it lead somewhere was just out of control. I actually was kinda scared and wanted it to go away but I knew if i started thinking like that I might go in a bad trip so i tried to work the cd player but was unable to since i kept on getting memory relapses and thinking i was at the beach again. i actually remember stepping on the sand and felling the sand. This drug opens up the part of the brain that holds memories and past feelings. i never thought about my friend till hours and hours later. i know think differntly about everything my vision is still weird and I have visual tracers. <BR>
<BR>
9:00 I was absolutely mind fucked. i thought it was mourning and my mom was waking me up for school (by the way I'm 31 years old) everything was so real. Another memory of my trip is when i thought I was watching t.v but relly myy mind was doin the trick. I swear i was watching shows but in reality the t.v was off. i dont know wat shows but I remember i was watching t.v.<BR>
<BR>
Or maybe i wasnt watching t.v but it was a memory of watching t.v and i just happened to re-live it. Who knows!! Well I didnt sleep the whole night I was still not right on the head Still talkin to people and around 12:00 the next day about 21 hrs later i was still pretty trippin but not as hard as before. I was able to think logically by then. I was thinkin wat a weird 21 hrs of my life which seemed like 5 or 6 years. Very very weird time. I do not suggest this plant to anyone that doesnt have good mind stability.<BR>
Then when i was finally able to get up I went to the rest room and I wasnt able to open the door and i was wondering why and my friend was on the other side passed out so i panicked for a while but he was breathing so i felt better he was in the bathroom trippin for like 20hrs till he fell asleep. One thing I like about this drug is one moment youre here the next somewhere else. thats weird feeling trust me. BE CAREFULL!!<!--   End Body   -->

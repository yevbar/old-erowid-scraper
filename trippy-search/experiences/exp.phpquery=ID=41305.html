I have been using 10mg Olanzapine a day following a psychotic episode brought on by a few bad acid and ecstasy trips that happened over a year ago now. Since then, I have been slowly working towards reintegrating myself back into normal life, and it has to be said that the Olanzapine has helped a lot.<br>
<br>
It all started after a few bad acid trips, but, not wanting to be disparaged from something that a lot of other people seem to consider a great and mind opening thing, decided to persist with hallucinogenic drugs - something which, looking back, was probably not the wisest idea.<br>
<br>
I started becoming very intense around everyone I met, not yet in an intolerable way, but in a 'you need to chill out man' sort of way. My ego was also getting a bit out of hand, but that was of little concern - what was of concern was that I was becoming increasingly incapable of handling relaxed situations.<br>
<br>
After a while I could no longer handle taking ecstacy any more, without feeling that the entire club knew who I was. I could no longer function on weed, speed made me tired and I was starting to require alcohol every day just to keep the paranoia at bay. The only drugs that didn't give me a sense of nuclear paranoia were cocaine and valium, both of which I had a feeling it would be a bad idea to get into a habit of taking considering my mental state at the time.<br>
<br>
But then it got worse. I decided to take mushrooms one night with a few friends, thinking the worst was over - oh no. When I got back to the flat I had this terrible feeling of dread, that no amount of alcohol would make go away, so I decided to go to bed instead. I suddenly heard a loud voice, which I knew was in my head, saying to me 'TONIGHT, YOU ARE GOING TO DIE'. Naturally, I was quite disappointed - I had always forseen living quite a bit past 20, but then it continued, '...AND YOU'RE GOING TO HELL'.<br>
<br>
That was it, I had to leave the flat and seriously rethink my life. While I was having this heavy discussion with myself, one of my friends called to see what this was up to. Taking this as a sign, I decided to go round and visit them. When I got back to the flat, my crazy flatmates had kicked a hole in one of the doors in the flat and done something unspeakable in the kitchen - not something you wanna have to deal with with a head full of mushrooms.<br>
<br>
The same thing happened again when I took mushrooms a couple of weeks later - a demon from hell was gonna come and kill me and take me to the dark side. This time it didn't concern me so much and I just went down stairs where people were drinking tea.<br>
<br>
After that I (finally) decided trippy drugs were not for me and that stopping drinking for a few days would 'totally sort me out'. Unfortunately, this was not the case - I had to quit my job at a call centre because all the calls were freaking me out, we got evicted from the flat because we were refusing to pay rent because the place was such a mess, I was getting no work done at uni and I could not focus on anything.<br>
<br>
We moved to a new flat, but by this time I could not walk down the street without the feeling my presence could be felt within a two mile radius. I did training for new bar that was opening up, but got fired on the opening night before the place had actually opened - the manager did not give me a reason. By this time I was convinced that my life was in serious danger - totally irrelevant experiences from my past kept flashing before my eyes and alcohol was becoming a total necessity rather than a luxury.<br>
<br>
This continued until towards the end of 2003 when I was starting to believe that the world was going to end at new year 2004, that I was on a mission from God and that a demon was trying to suck out my soul to stop me - listening to myself, I decided that people who think like this generally require help. I figured that whatever psychiatrist I saw would be God in human form and that (s)he would tell me what to do.<br>
<br>
Nothing happened at new year 2004, except that my level of paranoia had grown so great that the majority of my friends no longer wanted to talk to me. I spent new years day in my room scrawling on an old envelope and couldn't talk to my family. It was probably the worst day I will ever have in my life.<br>
<br>
I saw the psychiatrist a few days later and he told me I was suffering from a 'drug induced psychosis' and prescribed me some risperidone. Almost immediately, I felt my thoughts actually starting to reconnect again, but risperidone causes horrible muscle tension so the psychiatrist changed my prescription to Olanzapine instead.<br>
<br>
Olanzapine as a drug has no noticeable effects, apart from the fact that it makes me really hungry (I've gained about 15-20lbs since I started taking it, although I also no longer take ecstacy every week) and really tired, but not in a valium sort of way, more in a 'I can't keep my eyes open' sort of way. However, when I forget to take it, I notice myself drifting back to my alternative reality again, which just ain't fun.<br>
<br>
15 months after starting the Olanzapine, I can interact with the real world to a much greater extent, I am doing an art course (one good thing about a psychotic episode is that it does brilliant things for my creativity), although I do still like to have the music playing a bit louder and faster than the rest of the room do, so to speak.<br>
<br>
Overall, I gotta say that when it comes to 'mind opening' drugs, even though a lot of my friends still take them, the advice has to be 'stay away from the flipside'. I am finding refinding my sanity to be a far more satisfying and rewarding experience than any psychoactive.<!--   End Body   -->

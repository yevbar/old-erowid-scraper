My new drug is a relatively unheard of nutritional supplement called phenibut. I wouldn't necessarily call it a drug but more of a neurotransmitter with similar effects to GABA. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. Inhibitory doesn't mean ineffective, far from it, phenibut is a VERY powerful substance. I first read about phenibut online when I was researching nutritional supplements to help ease my mental anguish. You see I was once addicted to various drugs including Oxycontin and the demon crack cocaine. I was able to quit Oxycontin, albeit suffering severe withdrawal symptoms several times, but crack was another story. As many people know cocaine becomes a mental addiction that is much harder to quit than opiates, in my opinion. The ritual of cooking up my own crack was almost as fun as smoking that first rock. I was only able to stop using when got a DUI, lost my job, spent all my money, pawned my stuff and even stole from my family. I used to have bad paranoia, lock myself in my room after smoking and this didn't go away after I stopped. I had nightmares about people crawling through my window, completely irrational, and dreams about smoking crack and waking to find I was covered in sweat on the floor of my room. Needless to say I was a mess. <br>
	<br>
After trying various herbal supplements including, Rhodeola roesea, St. John's Wort and other mildly effective and overpriced vitamins and herbs I found phenibut. Labeled as a nootropic and anxiolytic, this sounded like good stuff. I found a vendor online who sold phenibut in bulk as a powder. I ordered 30g and waited impatiently for UPS to deliver my product. When it finally arrived I was so overcome with anticipation and longing I immediately mixed up a heaping spoonful in some Gatorade and chugged it down. YUCK! This stuff is gross, it tasted sweet yet bitter and slightly salty.  I waited for the effect to take hold, it took about 1 1/2 hours for the first sensation. I would describe it as similar to Valium or alcohol. Being an addict by nature I always want more so I drank another bitter orange flavored phenibut concoction. Another half hour passed and UGGGHHH I felt dizzy and nauseous, my head was in a cloud my body tingling with waves of energy. I got sleepy and went to bed hoping to wake refreshed. No such luck, I woke up and was even more fucked up than when I went to sleep. Plus my throat was so dry that my uvula had swollen up and was like a big balloon in the back of my throat.  I drank copious amounts of water and the effects waned throughout the day. As the severe feeling diminished I discovered that I enjoyed the milder effects much more than the severe. This was good, I had found a pleasurable substance that was by its very nature self limiting.<br>
	<br>
While experimenting with various dosages over the span of a week I read as much as I could about phenibut and analogous substances. To my surprise I read that baclofen, a very similar substance, was being tested on cocaine addicts and helped them with their cravings. I thought about this and I realized that I had not thought about cocaine even once the entire week, and even after I ran out of my supply of phenibut the fortuitous benefit stayed with me. I don't know why this worked but I believe phenibut somehow down regulated the overactive region of my brain that craved cocaine.<br>
	<br>
Phenibut has benefits and drawbacks. It can make me a blathering fool by lowering inhibition. This can be a good thing if you are shy, but could also make an outgoing person wildly over exuberant. If I combine phenibut with alcohol the effects are additive as alcohol works on similar neurotransmitters namely GABA. I once took methadone and drank at the same time with phenibut and was totally gone. Now I take phenibut only when I go out with friends and want to be more social. I have also given it to some friends who complained of the overwhelming initial effects. Some came back for more and others stayed away, it just depends on personal preference. <br>
<br>
All in all phenibut is a different drug with unusual effects and possible addiction cessation properties. Use with caution and awareness of the benefits and side effects.<!--   End Body   -->

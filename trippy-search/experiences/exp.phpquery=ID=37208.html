<!--   Start Body   -->


I've been taking paxil for about 2 years now for anxiety disorders (panic attacks & OCD).  I noticed a lot of submissions in the paxil experience vault here & thought I'd offer up my own experiences of paxil, well, fucking with me, as a little warning to anyone taking it either medicinally or recreationally.<br>
<br>
My worst paxil experience occurred a little over a year ago, when I had just upped my dose from 12.5mg to 25mg (per day).  I had been drinking all night with my friends, as much as I normally would, & late into the evening I sparked up a bowl of mj, which I also often do.  We smoked a bowl between the three of us that were there at the time, & I was feeling good & high-drunk for maybe a half hour after smoking.  At the time I was also continuing to drink beer.  But then I started feeling not-so-well.  I tried to tough it out, but eventually decided I needed to lie down for a while.  One of my friends, whose apartment we were in, asked if I was going to be sick & I said I was fine, fully believing it.  So I lay down on the couch & closed my eyes & sort of continued to participate in conversation, but I started to experience the closest thing I'd ever had to a trip at this point in my life.<br>
<br>
Eyes closed, I saw my body outlined in stars against the sky, sort of like a sparkly chalk outline.  It made me really happy & I think I was telling my friends about it.  Then I felt like I was in an attic - I knew where I *actually* was at the time, but in my mind I could see me & my friends in an attic & it fit for some reason.  I remembered one of my friends but forgot who the other girl was, & I was racking my brain trying to remember who she was - both her name & her appearance.  Then I started feeling nauseous & said I thought I was going to puke soon, but before anyone could do anything about it, I barfed.  All over myself & the couch I was on.  It was embarrassing & gross.<br>
<br>
My (wonderful!!) friend washed my shirt for me & got me a trash can, & I continued to barf into that & then spent the rest of the night clutching it & feeling crappy until I passed out.  I don't know for sure, but I attribute this to the paxil, since I have never been that helplessly sick from just alcohol & weed.  The 'trip' was also something that had never happened to me.  I should note also that I do take ritalin as well (40mg these days) & have done so for 13 years, so that's in the mix too, but I have found that it doesn't interact badly with weed or booze, as far as I can tell.  I never had another incident like this.<br>
<br>
My other notable paxil problem occurred a couple months ago.  Like I said, I've been taking meds for most of my life, & I don't know if I've ever screwed it up - except for this time of course.  I was at work & it was time for the afternoon ritalin; I was also on antibiotics then & it was time for that pill too.  I took two pills, & only after the fact did I realize I'd taken a paxil instead of a ritalin.  And of course I'd already taken my paxil that morning.  So I took the ritalin & hoped nothing bad would happen.  I noticed a couple hours later that I was more talkative than normal, hyper almost, & I talk a lot normally so I might have been annoying.  I felt kind of bouncy & 'up'.  It wasn't unpleasant really, but not particularly pleasant either.<br>
<br>
I went over to my friend's after work & smoked a couple bowls, but avoided alcohol of any kind due to aforementioned puking incident.  The high didn't feel very different, & it chilled out my hyperness a little.  Later I went home, smoked another bowl & watched some TV as I fell asleep.  At this point my jaw started feeling weird & I was clenching it a LOT.  I had to concentrate REALLY hard on not biting down & even then I eventually gave up on it.  My mouth would just not be like it normally is at resting state.  It was bizarre, but gone in the morning.<br>
<br>
So in conclusion, kids, respect the paxil & be careful with it.  Do as I say & not as I do, & try not to mix it with alcohol.  My doc told me that paxil & alcohol are metabolized by the same liver enzyme, so if you're liver's dealing with the paxil & then you throw a bunch of alcohol in it, things can get messy & even dangerous.  I've cut down on my liquor intake since finding that out, & I should probably cut down even more.  Haven't noticed any other problematic drug interactions with it, but as I am with the ritalin, I assume it makes my tolerance lower for certain things. (I don't know if this is actually true but it sounds good, no?)  <br>
<br>
If you're taking it recreationally... personally I don't quite get how paxil would be fun, but who am I to judge, so be careful & again, WATCH THE ALCOHOL!!  Also avoid MAOI's if you're going to be on paxil because MAOIs don't mix well with most Rx drugs.  I started smoking passionflower a while ago & it made me feel slightly weird, & then I found out it was an MAOI so no more of that.<!--   End Body   -->

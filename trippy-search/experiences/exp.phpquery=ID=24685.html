Back in 1980 I was a freshman at a small liberal arts college in the northeastern U.S.  I had begun to experiment with drugs other than my mainstay of marijuana used during my high school years.  <BR>
<BR>
One night I was partying with my friend I'll call L. We were smoking bong hits and adding some powdered cocaine to the tops of the pot hits.  I don't remember that we were smoking anything particularly potent but what followed was something I wonder about to this day. We were sitting cross legged on the floor facing each other. I took another hit and put the bong down. All of a sudden, I felt myself levitating and bringing L up with me until we were about 6 feet up and hovering just below the ceiling.  I remember looking right at L and being calm and as content as the Cheshire Cat.  We stayed floating there for what seemed like 30 seconds and then we _ever_ so gently returned to the floor. <BR>
<BR>
I have often wondered whether we were physically floating or whether our spirits were briefly freed from their normal constraints.  I am leaning towards the latter.  The gentleness of the whole experience really struck me. I felt as if we were being cared for by a higher power and to this day I think about this and am confident that we are not alone and are cared for and loved by being(s) that we can't ordinarily perceive.  I was also awed by the fact that we both perceived this phenomenon simultaneously.  When we were back on the ground, L asked me 'were we just floating'? Yes, yes we were.<!--   End Body   -->

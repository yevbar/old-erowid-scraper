I took 0.5 mg of Bromo Dragonfly and it took about 4 hours to come on. After a couple of hours I didn't think it was going to work. I began to get a slight feeling in my head. Not really good or bad, some people I imagine may become nauseous by this, but it didn't bother me.  There was a very slow build up over a period of hours where the visuals were slowly increasing in intensity. They were not as strong as acid in terms of dose for dose. I would describe Bromo as a gentle acid trip that lasts for almost 24 hours.<BR>
<BR>
During the trip my thinking was totally interconnected and I was able to think to a certain degree, holographically, thinking about everything all at once and focusing on what I felt was important at the time. It was a great aid in terms of understanding, however no more so than I would describe any other psychedelic that I have taken. I would advise having a very good night sleep before taking this because it goes on for a long such a long time. The benefit depending on reasons for taking it is the extended period of time that one has to think and focus on ones desired subject matter.<BR>
<BR>
To conclude. Everything about this drug is gentle, it is like a wave that rises and falls very slowly. Or to put it another way it is the psychedelic polar opposite of DMT.<!--   End Body   -->

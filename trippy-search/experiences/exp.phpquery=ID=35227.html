It was just another boring day at summer school. It was a Friday, I had no plans for the weekend and my girl friend had been on vacation for the past 2 weeks and wouldn't be getting back for another 3 days. I had my usual ritalin in the morning, to wake me up. Then a few hours later to get me to enjoy my day, like usual.<br>
<br>
Just as I got home I received a call from my speedhead friend (we hunt, share, and do speed together daily). He asked me right away if I had any plans, and if I didn't, then did I have any money and how much? I said yes, about twenty bucks, why? He then told me a girl we know who is a meth head is selling a half gram of some really good coke for 30 bucks. I was at his house in 3.. 2.. 1...<br>
<br>
Neither of us had ever gotten to doing coke, I had some experience with the substance from doing ecstacy which contained MDMA, meth, and coke. But never just plain cocaine, which had always surprised people since I am such a speedhead. Wasting no time we ran up to his room and chopped/lined it up. I had paid more, so I went first. I hadn't felt any real need to every try it, I was always more interested in e and meth, but the way people talked about it made me give it a shot.<br>
<br>
On the initial pull there was no real rush at all. I snort so much speed that I barely ever feel a rush anymore. I passed the box with the rest of the lines in it to my friend and proceeded to licking the plastic it had come in. I did not see what the big deal was, the taste wasn't good, but it wasn't bad. It did not burn much, I felt barely anything at all.<br>
<br>
When it began to hit me I was loving it. I got the floaty feeling I get from a lot of ritalin, but also an overwhelming feeling of freedom, confidence, and belonging. This combined with my new rush of energy and numbness had me suggesting we go for a walk right away. Time just flashed by, I remember us having some extremely strange conversations.<br>
<br>
Towards the end of the night my friend stopped by and we did the last two bumps that were left, then we sat in my room listening to music while I played guitar. We would just keep looking at each other and smiling, without saying a word. If one of us started speaking the other one wouldn't really be comprehending what was being said, but neither cared. Somehow it just felt that we were on the same level, and understood each other perfectly.<br>
<br>
After he left the fun ended. I began to shake, I was nervous beyond belief. I felt more paranoid than any amount of speed has ever made me. I felt so alone, but when I would talk to people I would just zone out. I could hear what was being said but I didn't care, I didn't care to even try. Deciding that since it was now about one in the morning and there wouldn't be any chance of sleep for the next few hours I called my girl friend. This was bad. I really wanted to talk to her, I really missed her, it felt like there was a never ending list of things that I wanted to tell her, but just couldn't. I told her of what I'd done over the course of the day and she was worried. This did not make me feel any better. It seemed like I was numb to all the positive emotions of life, and all the negative ones would be amplified. I told her I was going to go to sleep. It took me five hours in bed until I woke up at seven.<br>
<br>
I woke up with much the same feeling, maybe not as bad. I smoked weed a few times in the morning to make myself feel a bit better and to help me come down. I didn't come down until about three pm.<br>
<br>
Overall the high was great, the experience was fun. But the coming down is too much, this added to the price would make me say that it's really not worth it, I'm happier with high dosage's of ritalin. I might try it again some time, but I definately don't see how this could be so addicting to some.<!--   End Body   -->

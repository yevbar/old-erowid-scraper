Trip report: 20mg 5meoDIPT, oral dose, ~10mg <BR>
insufflated.  Subject, male, 21, 160lbs, lots <BR>
of psychedelic experience.<BR>
<BR>
Hello!  I'm a brave chemical researcher, always<BR>
trying to push the envelope for the good of everyone.<BR>
Eh heh.  Actually, what I did last night resulted in<BR>
a great trip, but the route which I took was quite <BR>
reckless!  Don't mess around with research chemicals <BR>
unless you have a scale that can measure the usually<BR>
very small doses which you need.  A friend of mine, a<BR>
very magic lady, lent me some 5-MeO-DiPT<BR>
and I decided it was a must-try!<BR>
<BR>
At 10pm I took what I had eyeballed to be a twenty<BR>
milligram dose of 5-MeO-DiPT, in a gelcap.  The amount of<BR>
powder needed was very miniscule, and I must take this<BR>
opportunity again to warn that these small amounts<BR>
really should be weighed precisely.  At about midnight,<BR>
I shook out a small amount of powder and divided it into<BR>
what I 'thought' 5mg looked like.  I got two very small<BR>
lines, those of you into regularly snorting things would<BR>
not be satisfied with the size of these lines, but this<BR>
was no narcotic, this was a potent psychedelic!  The <BR>
powder didn't burn much at all, and the small amount<BR>
of chemical taste in my drip was more than tolerable.<BR>
I had noticed effects begin to start a mere half hour<BR>
after dosing.  I had fasted the entire day except for<BR>
one or two light snacks, so I attribute the rapid onset<BR>
to this.  There was little nausea, just barely <BR>
perceptable, but this soon faded as the trip began.<BR>
I determined to boost my effects and thus insufflated <BR>
the small lines two hours after dosing.  Normally if<BR>
you redose on this chemical, the literature says you<BR>
have to take more, but I think that up the nose results<BR>
in a faster onset and better bioavailibility.  <BR>
<BR>
At 12:30 the effects fully came on, with first a set of<BR>
low-hued visual distortions, followed by bright, <BR>
colorful tryptamine hallucinations, very like what<BR>
one would see on the traditional trips, acid, shrooms,<BR>
morning glory, but much cleaner and more intense.  The<BR>
colors were really something, it was a continually<BR>
 shifting spectrum, the whole of my range of site<BR>
cycling the colors in response to some rhythem I could<BR>
not comprehend.  During this come up and plateau of <BR>
the drug, I felt a few mind effects of tripping,<BR>
but overall I was very much in control at all times.<BR>
<BR>
I am pretty experienced with psychedelics, and moreso<BR>
with with the OTC favorite DXM, so this may have <BR>
something to do with the amount of control I maintained.<BR>
The visual distortions were really something else, fully<BR>
3-D bumps and ridges appearing out of no where, objects<BR>
swinging and flexing, etc.  At one point I stared<BR>
intently at my beige carpet, and was amazed to see it <BR>
turn into flowing sand dunes!  <BR>
<BR>
At about 3am I noticed a definent decrease in the<BR>
effects of the 5-MeO-DiPT.  At about this time I started<BR>
to smoke a lot of weed, and also began to feel the<BR>
body load come on.  I got a few cramps up in my abdomen,<BR>
like near my belly button for some reason.  That was <BR>
the worst of it, other than a general achey feeling all<BR>
over, cleared up easily by ibuprofen. <BR>
<BR>
At this point, I actually started eating food!  The bong<BR>
had made me hungry, so I made several trips to the <BR>
kitchen.  Because I think vitamin C always helps trips<BR>
along, I grabbed and orange and a slice of bread and <BR>
devoured both in no time flat.  Then I went back and<BR>
got a pear, and then a banana; luckily we eat a lot of<BR>
fruit in my family!  I think my body preferred this<BR>
healthy snack over anything else I could have eaten, <BR>
although maybe the majority of fruit contributed<BR>
something to my cramp, who knows.  <BR>
<BR>
At 5:15am I was still tripping a little bit and getting <BR>
mild visuals, so I decided to turn in, figuring I was<BR>
sleepy enough from being awake so long that I wouldn't<BR>
need a sedative.  I expected tryptamine insomnia tho,<BR>
and got my share of it.  The hallucinations with only<BR>
night lumination coming through my shaded windows were<BR>
very cool, with my shadows 'freezing' in my line of<BR>
sight.  I tossed and turned a lot, mostly to try to<BR>
appease my cramped abdomen.  However by about 7am I<BR>
fell asleep, and woke up at 11:30am with the aid of<BR>
my alarm clock.<BR>
<BR>
It's now almost two the day after,<BR>
and I still feel kind of muffle-headed and dizzy. <BR>
Luckily I don't think that I really overdosed on this <BR>
substance, and if I did, the OD wasn't harsh or totally<BR>
bad.  Since I weighed out my doses just by eyeballing,<BR>
a very risky way to do things, there's no way really to<BR>
say how much I took, although in my research I see<BR>
that the average dose is at the high end 20mg, and<BR>
at the insane end 40mg+.  This was a very enjoyable<BR>
trip, and I've never had visuals this good!  This was my<BR>
first real experience with a research chemical, and I<BR>
must say that I'm really impressed.  My hat goes off<BR>
to our country's chemists, always preparing new and <BR>
exciting (and legal!) substances for the exploration<BR>
of conciousness.  I'd like to throw in my voice and<BR>
say that 5-MeO-DiPT is very enjoyable, and I'd like to see<BR>
more work done on this and other chemicals so that they<BR>
are more mainstream and safe and no longer need to be<BR>
'reasearched.'<!--   End Body   -->

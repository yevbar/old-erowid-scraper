Like curtains of raindrops falling down<BR>
Each glittering jewel a twinkling sound<BR>
your love sweeps upon me<BR>
within me<BR>
without<BR>
A breath of deadly beauty<BR>
And conciousness therein<BR>
You glitter and shine<BR>
And turn inside out<BR>
these selves that are calling my soul to come out<BR>
A sweet breath is blowing my soul into fire<BR>
My body is dying so that I might go higher<BR>
Into the void I now burst anew<BR>
The celestial creatures a blessing bestow<BR>
On my selfless dying and comedy show<BR>
The same experience a friend once had<BR>
to wander through the heavens<BR>
to experience the riddle of the universe<BR>
to remember what you forgot<BR>
to know who you are<BR>
to know you've come so far<BR>
to know your soul's evolution is infinite<BR>
to be ordered to say your piece of the puzzle<BR>
that is the fathomless mystery <BR>
that is the universe within us<BR>
to feel divine love ravage our body<BR>
and turn every cell inside out<BR>
to feel your bones ache<BR>
and know that one day your body will die<BR>
to know what will be left behind<BR>
to go beyond the door<BR>
that is guarded by the image of our self<BR>
to sacrifice this image so we may be born anew<BR>
well my friend said he did not know what to do <BR>
when he came back and had to talk to me and you<BR>
but he was very humble that friend of mine<BR>
who had sacrificed his body<BR>
to witness the mysteries of time<BR>
just imagine<BR>
just imagine being a limitless being<BR>
constantly imaging itself<BR>
constantly getting to know itself<BR>
constantly making love to itself<BR>
constantly suprised<BR>
and constantly being alarmed by itself<BR>
constantly enchanted by itself<BR>
constantly dying and constantly being born<BR>
constantly mended and constantly torn<BR>
constantly crying<BR>
and constantly laughing at us<BR>
the myriad lifeforms that inhabit it<BR>
that are it<BR>
that are its eyes and ears<BR>
And after all this I hear an angel's astonished shout<BR>
does it really fucking matter<BR>
who we think we are<BR>
does it really fucking matter if the Jones have a bigger car<BR>
does it really fucking matter <BR>
if someone beats you up<BR>
does it really fucking matter<BR>
if you live in a rubbish bin<BR>
when such truly timeless beauty<BR>
can be found within<!--   End Body   -->

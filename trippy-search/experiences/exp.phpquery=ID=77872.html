I read about the Spice 'incense' product in an online news article. After setting out to find it, I realized that it was already difficult to procure in the US. After some searching I found a Polish vendor selling it on eBay, and purchased a 3 gram package of Spice Silver.  It took about 2 weeks to arrive.<br>
<br>
The Saturday after receiving the package I decided to give it a shot and see if the stuff would have any effect on me.  I decided to use my one-hitter that I typically use for weed.  I pinched about 1/20th the content out of the shiny pouch and packed the bowl.  I estimated this to be only 150 mg, which is a small amount.  I took my first hit and noticed that the flavor was nothing like cannabis.  It was a lot ‘fruitier’ tasting, but not harsh.  I held the first hit for about 20 seconds and finished the small bowl off with another 2 hits.<br>
<br>
After the first 5 minutes, I felt a very warm sensation in my limbs and had a little weightlessness feeling, but nothing very mental happening yet.  After another 5 minutes I felt a very familiar sensation of ‘getting high’ exactly as if I had just hit some decent bud.  Shortly after this feeling my eyes became very sensitive to light, which doesn’t normally happen with bud.  I was definitely high, and getting my normal head-rush feeling.  About 20 minutes in my eyes were no longer sensitive to light, but I was getting cotton-mouth, exactly like I would if I had some big bong hits.<br>
<br>
I was getting all giggly, and definitely enjoying the buzz.  The buzz felt exactly like that of cannabis, but I had only smoked a very small amount.  About 1 hour in, I realized that I was still just as high as when it first hit me.  I listened to some music, watched a little TV and before I knew it, another hour had passed and I was still just as high.  After hour 3, I could feel myself starting to come down and I became very hungry.  I made up a pizza and then went outside for a walk around.  Upon entering the fresh air outside I couldn’t believe how high I still was.  Finally around 5PM I felt pretty normal.  What a long lasting high from only 3 little hits!<br>
<br>
The next day I decided to make some tea using the Spice.  I brought 1.5 cups of water to a roiling boil and made a loose-leaf tea with another ~150 mg pinch from the shiny pouch.  I let the tea steep for a full 15 minutes until it was cool enough to drink.  I drank the tea slowly and enjoyed the herbal flavor.  When I was near the bottom of the cup I purposely drank in portions of the herbs and thoroughly chewed them before swallowing it.  I started drinking the tea at ~10AM and finished up drinking, chewing the herbs about 20 minutes later.<br>
<br>
It took about another 40 minutes until I felt the first signs of effect.  I noticed that lights looked a little edgy and that I was sensitive to light again.  By 11:30 I had a full body buzz that cycled between being a very mental feel (Like I experienced when I smoked it) and a full body buzz that made me feel a little clumsy, but warm and relaxed.  I felt this way until ~6PM and couldn’t believe how long the body buzz lasted.  By 7PM I felt like I was back at baseline.  I did not get the acute hunger like I did when I smoked it.  I did however experience dry mouth a few times throughout the day.<br>
<br>
I did not experience any ill side-effects from smoking or the tea.  Overall I really enjoyed both buzzes, and I’m glad I tried it on a weekend when I had extra time to kill because the buzzes lasted way longer than I had expected.<!--   End Body   -->

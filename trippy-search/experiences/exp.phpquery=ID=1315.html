While walking home last night i was approached by an old man with long a long grey beard and bright blue twinkling eyes who began to relate to me some experienece he'd had with one of his friends many moons ago. He was quite obviously insane:<BR>
<BR>
'100g of Mimosa Hostillis root bark was ground to powder in a coffee grinder. To this was added 100ml of lemon juice (3 lemons) and 300ml of mineral water.  It was brewed for three hours, with water added on occasion to prevent it from boiling dry. The liquid was decanted and the juice of one lemon added to the remaing bark matter, which was left overnight. The next day more water was added and it was simmered for a further 2 hours. This mixture was filtred through a spaghetti strainer and combined with the decanted water from the previous day to yielded some 1.3 litres. This was simmered for a few hours down to 600ml which would give 5 x 20g 120ml doeses. 25g of Peganum Harmala seeds were ground in a coffee grinder, 4 gram doses being prepared by division of the powder into six equal parts.<BR>
<BR>
I ate the rue in one mouthful  (1 level dessert spoon) washed down with copious ammounts of water. It had an earthy dessert taste to it but it was not overly unpleasant and did not promt the slightest nausea. After about 15 mins the effects began to take hold. I felt slightly wobbly but not in a drunken way. Rapid movement of my eyes produced  green swirling eidetic imagery and i felt mildly elated. After 30 minutes when the time came to drink the mimosa, the impending experience, combined with the realisation that it would be more intense than i had anticipated caused me to feel quite nauseus and after several minutes I spewed. Soon i felt sufficiently able to drink the purple liquid. At this point we both concured that a dose of 50-60 ml would be wiser, and this I drank over 15 minutes, spewing it up again after only a few minutes. <BR>
<BR>
After about half an hour i began to feel the effects of the mimosa. My body suddenly felt subtley different and i began to see coulered patterns with my eyes closed. My rate of thinking accelerated dramatically and i began to sense an otherness, an electrical jabbering of swrling calculating thought energy, my mind was open to recive input from a source it had not encountered before. I could not maintin my sitting position and had to lie in the revovery position as i was still feeling nauseous. With my eyes closed hordes of entities clamoured for my attention, made of coloured fractal energy, leading my thought processes onto calculations of things incomprehensible to me. The mental demand of performing these tasks become too much and i tried to change the experience, to direct my attention elsewhere. But they kept showing me this question or path i had to follow. Failure to proceed, they assured me, would result in them abandoning me to the physical world where they would torture me by vomiting, and other physical discomforts, which they showed me that they controlled.<BR>
<BR>
I tried several times to carry on with what they were forcing me to do but in the end i had to give up and resigned myself to spewing violently. When it became clear to them that i could not continue they all hurried off. They soon returned however, but in a more concillatory mode, bringing another type of entity, one that seemed much more quiet and peaceful. Its purpose was to give me information. It showed me many things about the functioning of the universe and the different systems within it. Most of the time i was desperately trying to keep up with what it was showing me but when i managed to totally grasp some idea, I reflected it back and there was an instant ding! of mutual understanding. As the experience lessened in intensity, the jabbering insistent etities receeded, i assured them that i would try harder next time. 'Yes, next time' they said 'next time', spelling out the words with their movements they departed.<BR>
<BR>
As I came down from the experience I could feel all the knowledge i had gained slipping away. I tried to integrate it in a form i could remember and convey by speech but now it is all forgotten. Perhaps further experiences will enable me to bring some of this back with me into ordinary reality or maybe it is knowledge which is unknowable when my brain is in it normal state. I was quite surprised that such a dosage produced such an intense trip, though my companion who took an identical dosage was similarly affected.<!--   End Body   -->

I had purchased an ounce of Amanita Muscaria at a local headshop about a month ago.  I had just been waiting for the right time and place to experience them as I know the importance of set and setting.  However, upon reading a few reports of smoking the skin, I decided that it would be a good way to test them out.  <br>
<br>
So a few hours after MSU lost the Final Four game to Butler, I gave it a shot.  I was already pretty buzzed at this point; having drank about 5 beers over the course of the game.  I know this contributed to me having the balls to smoke mushrooms just a few hours before my wife would be home but I knew I could just go lay in bed and enjoy my trip if need be.  The process was as follows:  I peeled a 2cm x 2cm piece of the red skin off the cap.  I rolled it up into little balls and filled my pipe.  I smoked it all gone and felt no major effects, other than increased salivation.  <br>
<br>
I then decided to smoke a little K2 (that I had around to avoid dropping dirty on drug tests) hoping that it would calm my stomach in case of nausea.  I used a different pipe for this but for some reason the smoke tasted just like cinnamon sugar.  I still felt nothing after that so I decided to go ahead and eat the small piece of Amanita that I had peeled the skin off of.  <br>
<br>
About an hour later I found myself defecating and constantly reminding myself that I wasn't going to die.  For some reason I had a nervous thought in the back of my mind that I was going to die.  So I decided to drink some water and lay down for a while and try to go to sleep.  The negative vibe continued and although I had no nausea whatsoever, I had the urgent sensation of vomit pulsing up my throat and lots of mucus collecting in my sinuses.  The water helped stop the vomit sensation and I rode the trip out successfully without purging.  The trip was very very weird though.  Unlike nothing I've experienced.  I saw a few scary faces on my ceiling but decided to close my eyes and try to sleep instead because of the negativity.  I must have fell asleep soon because the next thing I remember was waking up to my wife coming to bed and when I opened my eyes everything was fine.<!--   End Body   -->

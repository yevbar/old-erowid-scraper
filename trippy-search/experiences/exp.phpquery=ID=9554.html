I was given some Adderall by a friend, so I split it 40/30 with my girlfriend at the time before we went to a show with some local bands. I had a generally great night, thinking everything was wonderful, couldn't stop talking (I was usually kind of inhibited about talking to people, but my shyness was gone), and my girlfriend was feeling absolutely awesome too. But the important part is yet to come. I got home and it had been close to six hours, I wasn't really feeling the ad anymore, but maybe that's cuz at this point I was alone and it is really a social drug to me. I had been bouncing off the walls all night and I had taken dimenhydrinate before, and found that 3-4 really mellowed me out, so I took 4 Dramamine. I have taken up to 9 before, but I now make a rule of never taking more than 4, cuz otherwise unpleasant sleepiness overwhelms all the strange trippiness of dimenhydrinate. I would describe my previous high dose experiences with Dramamine as dreaming while awake or maybe more accurately as an experience of schizophrenia?<BR>
<BR>
I don't really know, but about 30 minutes after I swallowed the pills, something strange happened. Suddenly all the lower case g's, and only the g's had solid black squares flashing around the letters. I looked up from the book and noticed strange invisible shapes that I could see floating around my room. I realized that these were some kind of innocuous invisible animals, quite harmless, but cool to look at. Soon my mind was going a mile a minute, thoughts were coming out of nowhere, flying through my mind, and gone just as fast. Due to the Adderall, there were none of the normal unpleasant side effects of Dramamine, and I was tripping at a much lower dose, and a much higher trip than Dramamine had ever done before for me. Also cuz of the Adderall, I couldn't stop talking again, despite being alone. Soon I was whispering all my thought, trying to figure something out about reality. I don’t know what it was, though because I could no longer remember the beginning of the sentence that I was finishing. Things continued to be very strange in a very amplified-Dramamine way.<BR>
<BR>
After a couple hours of this, I no longer knew what was real and what was not. I'm lucky that I stayed in my room as I always do taking drugs at night, where I wouldn’t disturb my sleeping family. I didn’t sleep, and in the morning I thought spiders were jumping off my ceiling onto me, but when I tried to brush them of or find the ones on the floor, I couldn’t find a single one. A wooden statue that I have on my book case started moving and speaking to me with my mom's voice, I’m not sure what it said to me, except that it was around noon on Saturday, so it told me I needed to get out of bed and get up basically. I obeyed unthinkingly. About 30 minutes later hallucinations subsided, but things were !Strange! All day. I didn’t sleep for about three days, but I know from friends who have done it that this is a common side effect of the first time taking Adderall.<BR>
<BR>
During the night I had turned out the lights and lay down at some point, and from then until light returned I had strange hallucinations, very like dreams, being enacted completely inside my room, people would come, converse with me and go, or I would be with my friends, across town toking in a car, then suddenly back in my room alone confusing, I was distressed that I was not wearing anything (I sleep nude or in boxers) when hanging out with my friends! Bizarre shit. I have noticed similar, but less potent effects with Dramamine and other stimulants, and unlike Dramamine & Adderall there were some unpleasant effects, but quite mild compared to normal side effects of Dramamine tripping.<BR>
<BR>
I was also once plunged into a nonsensical stupor by Adderall and an unknown tranquilizer in which I seemed to be functioning sort of like sleep walking, me and my friend went all over town, dropped some people off, and got ripped off for a quarter sack before I awoke from a strange dream involving orange and pink elves running off with our money and a bag of neon red plant material in my friends room, instantly back to baseline. It sounds like a cool experience, but I actually remember far too little of the dream to make it worthwhile. I must emphasize, though that you probably will eventually lose the ability on Dramamine and Adderall to distinguish real from unreal<!--   End Body   -->

I had done my research on Blue Lotus. I had been looking for some time for a mild alternative to cannabis. However, I also seek the mental feeling of well-being that blue lotus purportedly imbibes on the user. I had just bought 5 grams of the flower the previous afternoon from a local dealer. <br>
<br>
I sat down in the plant room, ready for what would occur, unsure as what my reaction would be. (I am extremely sensitive to almost all substances, and in my experience, I am always 'hit harder' than anyone else I know.) I sat down, the window open behind me, and proceeded to break off a single leaf from a dried flower and snap it into small pieces so that they would fill my pipe. I sat down, relaxed and ignited my leaf in the bowl. It flamed hot and as I drew the smoke into my lungs, I found it much milder than cannabis. I held it for about 7 seconds in my lungs, then exhaled, letting the sweet-smelling smoke out (I have sinces used some of the flower petals as a very nice smelling incense). <br>
<br>
After about 2 hits, I began to feel drifty, as if I was being swept up into the clouds on a cloud, with a feeling of such quiet joy that I smiled and took two more hits. I put my pipe away, and felt extremely relaxed, not a care in the world, smiling gently with my mind clear as a mountain stream. I went to bed and laid down, thinking of many things and experiencing a shift into more mentally active, cannabis-like effects. I felt very happy and relaxed. I invented a term for being under the influence of Blue Lotus, as I felt that the term 'stoned' was more related to cannabis. I therefore termed my state as being 'Germinated', since I felt as if my mind were open like a glorious flower, at peace and joyously happy. <br>
<br>
I went to sleep shortly after, and awoke the following morning still a bit buzzed. This faded, but I was extremely satisfied with my experience.<!--   End Body   -->

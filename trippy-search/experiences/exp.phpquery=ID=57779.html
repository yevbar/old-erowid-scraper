It was a Thursday night, and my friend and I were sitting at another friends house awaiting the arrival of our 4-aco-mipt. I had never tripped on anything in my life, and was in anxious anticipation.  When my friend's buddy arrived with the 4-aco, he said that he usually liked to dish out about 30mg or so in order to lead to an extreme trip.  I was kind of scared, but after all the research I had done on the chemical I was excited at the same time.  He dished out some powder in a shot of coca-cola to each of us.  We weren't planning on tripping right then and there, but we did.  <br>
<br>
0:00 - Took a few drinks of soda with 30mg of 4-aco-mipt on a completely empty stomach.<br>
<br>
0:15 - starting to feel a bit anxious and jittery.<br>
<br>
0:20 - cannot seem to function the Nintendo system at all, and I'm starting to see movement in my visual spectrum. Colors are changing and I look at the trim on the door and it changes into such a rainbow of an image. Colors are shooting in from behind me and it seems that the wind has a sort of tint to it.<br>
<br>
0:30 - I give up the Nintendo and have to sit down, this is getting intense.  I start to see the rug on the floor gain some body and height.  It starts to twirl and twist like it does in the hotel scene from the film, 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.' That is the best way to describe the first onset of visuals.  <br>
<br>
0:45 - Tripping extremely hard and visualizing so many different things. People's faces are completely distorted and my mind is racing, filled with thoughts and enlightenment.  People seem to be cartoon to an extent.  I sit down and stare at a flower pot covered in specks of dirt on a small table.  The specks start to crawl all over the table and pot and I am completely amused.<br>
<br>
0:60 - Astounded by the power of this chemical.  Dark Side of the Moon is on in the background and people are starting to come to my friends house to buy weed and smoke and drink beer and stuff.  <br>
<br>
1:10 - I decide to take a breather from the surroundings of people and feel as if I should be doing something, I keep telling myself that I don't have anything to do at all.  I just need to settle down and chill.  I sit down again in my friends room and the sounds of people coming up the stairs create mild auditory hallucinations. A sort of twanging and repeating of noises keeps ringing, but it's not unpleasant at all.<br>
<br>
1:30 - Tracers and full blown cartoon characters are covering my visual spectrum.  I look at my friends and just laugh.  I decide it's time for a cigarette and I figure I am most likely peaking at about this time.  The cigarette tasted like pure gasoline and chemicals, gross.  Looking at the cherry of my cigarette, I could see every little detail as it twirled around amongst itself and as I stared off into the trees outside when I was on the balcony, they started to grow and morph together.  <br>
<br>
2:00 - Still peaking and visualizations are incredible. A friend comes over with a recording of his bands new songs, they are incredible and I let him know I'm tripping.  He comforts me a little bit and I start to stare at things, obviously tripping my balls off.<br>
<br>
for the next hour or so I sat there in complete awe....<br>
after I started to taper off the tripping stage I felt amazing and glowing with enlightenment.<br>
<br>
I tried 4-aco-mipt again last week and it was a little less intense but very fun...<!--   End Body   -->

Recently entering college was a true milestone in my life, and I was determined to live life to the fullest.  I had started drinking in high school, but that was all the drug experience.<br>
<br>
After a few weeks, a friend of mine who had commented on his past experiences with coke finally got some on campus, and I tried it.<br>
<br>
I felt great and bouncy, and I was more social than usual, but the come-down was always far too hard;  I would have an okay sleep, but when I woke up, the dehydration was horrible.  I would feel extremely dizzy and nauseated, but after drinking a few tall glasses of water and passing out for a few more hours, I would be back to normal.  <br>
<br>
After a while, the every-now-and-then usage turned into a weekly coke night with groups of people.  Soon I started buying my own so that I wouldn't have to wait for the weekly session to have some.  I often would take a line before a party to get that energy, but it never had the same effect as that first time.<br>
<br>
Also, my nose became dry and irritated, and even a light rubbing of it when sleeping would produce pain.  Mixing it with alcohol made it more intense and also made it so I didn't have to drink much to get very trashed.<br>
<br>
Overall, it was a great disappointment, and having to lie to friends (even other users) about the habit-- not to mention having to endure the physical side effects -- just isn't worth it at all.<!--   End Body   -->

I've never heard of anyone being crazy, or stupid enough to attempt to combine tripping with a nice coke experience. The night I took all these chemicals began simply enough. Me and some friends were just drinking little and smoking a little bud, waiting for another one of my friends to get off work, so we could get some coke. I already had gotten together a bunch of 2C-E doses, and some of us were thinking about tripping.<br>
<br>
After we finally got the coke and all took a sample line, we returned back to my friends house. It is then I decided to take the 2C-E. By this time I had taken about 4 shots of some pretty garnly liquor. After taking a couple more lines and chilling for around an hour, I began to feel sick. This was the 2C-E coming up. I finally ended up feeling sick for about 25 minutes, and throwing up once. 30 minutes after that I was into my trip.<br>
<br>
I was allready blown by the time the 2C-E began to take full effect. The cocaine at times almost seemed to intensify all my thoughts and feelings. Yet I felt incredibly mellow during most of the trip. I felt like I could just sit back and melt into the reality of existence. When I was probably halfway into my trip I decided it was time to start sessioning the coke again. Fortunealtey my one friend, who was tripping was just about to cook up some sheets. <br>
<br>
I can safely say smoking crack on 2C-E is a very strage experience. As soon as I exhaled my first hit, the pattrens I was seeing in the bathroom started to slow down a bit and mellow out. The colors I was seeing however allready intensifed by the 2C-E jumped out even more. I felt amazing. The coke high combined with the trip gave me a feeling of utter peace and control. It was almost as if I was the master of the universe. I took another hit and then sat on my friends couch for awhile.<br>
<br>
Again, my thoughts raced in my head while the world seemed almost slow around my. I don't remember thinking about much, all I can remember is that my thoughts were intense. The weirdest part is, about 30 minutes later I began to come down from my crack hits the patterns I was seeing began to become more intense again. After the crack, it was a much more intense clear reality, at least that is the best way I can describe the experience.<br>
<br>
This was my 2nd time tripping on 2C-E, so I am still very unexperienced with how it feels.  Overall, the coke mostly seemed to mask the trip and the effects of the 2C-E, although in some ways it seemed to intensify it, mostly the rate at which I thought and my euphoria/body high. I eventually ended this night smoking bowls, and was surprisingly able to fall asleep about 11 hours after dosing on 2C-E. I felt brain dead for a few days after this experience, and this is definitely a combo that I will not be repeating.<!--   End Body   -->

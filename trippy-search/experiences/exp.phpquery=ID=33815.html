I picked up some and began to take Them daily.  Within no time at all, I felt much better.  I had Lots of energy for cleaning the house and just generally better Spirits.  I was even trying to get my elderly father and my friends to take it because it was working.  I felt happy.  I even had a glow.  <br>
<br>
Well, this was fine except that little by little my judgement was slipping without me recognizing it.  I was truly on a high (but I thought it was natural).  I became fearless even. I opened a business which I had always wanted to do but was scared of making a big mistake.  I threw myself into this business from 7 in the morning until 11 at night.  Nope still not tired.  <br>
<br>
For now, I was truly happy.  I must have been in a stage of mania and thought I was just happy.  After about a year exactly of taking  this drug, I began to feel very sexually attracted to someone who would be considered not attractive in any way, manner, or form. Not even a person to be respected.  I had been married since 1983 to a wonderful man and had been true to him and I loved him deeply so when this happened a red flag should have gone up, but it didn't.  This man was also married.  From this point my life went totally downhill and my judgment had gone out of the window but I didn't realize it.  I thought this was meant to be because I had these strong feelings.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, one thing lead to another, I ended up with a divorce, losing my home and most of my friends from my hard earned reputation, my mind - it was just gone, my money, my everything . . . Gone.  Now I see psychiatrist and doctors for a living practically.  If I were getting paid I would be rich.  I'm on three psychiatric drugs and constantly running to this doctor or that doctor since 1998, April.  My life is in shambles and I can't seem to get straight.  Everyone that knows me closely and watched this agrees I changed tremendously after taking this supplement.<!--   End Body   -->

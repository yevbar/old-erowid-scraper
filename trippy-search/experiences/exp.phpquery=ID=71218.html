Intending to measure out 150mg of Methylone I, incredibly foolishly, picked up the wrong bag and proceded to ingest approximately 150mg of 4-HO-MET Fumarate. A largely psychedelic-naive friend was also dosed with approximately 50mg, again believing it to be methylone.<br>
<br>
First alert hit within 5 minutes, perhaps less. Realising my mistake, we attempted to induce vomiting with salt water, unsuccessfully. After 5 minutes of this, our fate was accepted and I explained what was in store to my friend. After some initial panic, the trip set in properly and there was little we could do but retreat to the relative safety of a bedroom and get on with it.<br>
<br>
The visual hallucinations were of an intensity I had never thought possible, and got stronger and stronger over the next hour or two. Multiple life-sized human figures, mainly female, their skin comprised of constantly-refreshing, pulsating and incredibly complex geometric hallucinations. These geometric patterns were 3 dimensional in their own right, wrapped and arranged into the human figures. These figures were extremely real, but benign and empathetic, and could be seen in equal intensity with eyes open or shut. With eyes open, objects were breathing, pulsating and changing in size and position in relation to each other, to a staggering extent.<br>
<br>
During the peak, approximately 90 minutes to 3 1/2 hours after ingestion, the interaction with these figures intensified to what can only be described as a cosmic mindorgy of some sort. This was incredibly pleasurable, blissful almost, somewhere between lust and extreme, all-encompassing empathy was felt between myself and these multiple hallucinatory figures. These feelings, though incredibly intense, were never scary or unpleasant in any way.<br>
<br>
For the middle and most intense part of the peak, maybe 2-3 hours in, these interactions continued, but my mind wandered through an incredible tapestry of thoughts, emotions and memories. I felt that I understood and empathised fully with everyone in my life, and the world made incredible sense. I was laughing uncontrollably through most of this time at the constant realisations. It felt like I had missed some incredibly subtle cosmic trick all these years, and now I had realised it I would never be the same again.<br>
<br>
The synchronicity was incredible, every object had it's own meaning, no matter how small or insignficant, every moment by every person spent pondering anything seemed part of some deeper plan, no second of idle ponderance in the entirety of human history wasted, everything part of this eternal and infinite plan.<br>
<br>
Metaphors of pirates and twisted, ponderous crackpots with crazed eyes and twirled moustaches, spectacles and purple top hats and pipes abounded, every tiniest thought like a great and powerful mystery to be mulled over for days by these crazed thinkers. The piratical metaphors took over at this point, my bones felt like sturdy oak and my flesh like leather. The interaction with the hallucinatory beings, which has continued during these meanderings, took on a twisted, tribal pirate rave at the end of the cosmos quality (words fail me at this point, that's the best I can describe it) and the mind-orgy became an uncomfortable proposition. <br>
<br>
I took this opportunity, perhaps 3 1/2 to 4 hours in, to retire to another room. The synchronicity had become so intense that it seemed my personal universe was some sort of incredibly complex matrix conspiracy bat shit involving only myself, my acquaintances and a few random players to keep me on my toes. I soon realised the insanity of this and left such thoughts behind. The last half hour of the peak was spent in intense introspection.<br>
<br>
By approximately 4 1/2 hours after the dose was administered, the hallucinations retreated and I was left in a comparatively sober mindset. Open-eye visuals of breathing and swirling objects remained, but the intricate and complex hallucinations had stopped. The next several hours were spent in an uncomfortable state of post-peak bodily malaise, but this had largely passed by t+8-9 hours. 22 hours after ingestion and I feel perfectly normal, if very drained.<br>
<br>
My friend reported similar happenings, an incredibly intense 4-5 hour peak followed by about 5 hours of malaise, though personally I find this post-peak malaise occurs with almost any hallucinogen in high doses. Telepathy was noted during the most intense moments of the peak, though that could well be explained by the shared experience and high doses. I have not had the chance to fully discuss the trip with my friend but I shall in a few days, and his thoughts may be added at a later date. Overall his experience was largely similar to my own, though.<br>
<br>
4-HO-MET is a remarkable substance, with a short duration of action, even at extreme doses. Despite my fairly high level of experience with psychedelics, both classical and research, the only experience which even comes close to the intensity of this one was a dose of around 8 dried grams of potent mushrooms.<br>
<br>
Addendum:<br>
<br>
Physical sensations were not very significant; there was a fair amount of tryptamine body rush, but I'd attribute that to peripheral stimulation. This rush was however, less intense than, say, a largish dose of 2C-E or 2C-I (~20 or 25mg). There was little discomfort during the peak, but during the comedown there was a fair quantity of GI/bladder/cough reflex tension. I was eventually sick at about t+8 hours after smoking a cigarette, but it was nothing major, and I felt much better afterwards.<br>
<br>
To be honest, the physical/tactile sensations were overpowered by the extreme mental effects about 20 minutes after dosing. Though I describe sexual feelings towards the beings, I was not physically aroused at any point during the experience - the feelings of empathy and acceptance were far stronger. I never had the feeling I'd dosed to a level that was physically dangerous.<br>
<br>
My tolerance level is not high at the moment, the only drugs I've taken in the last 8 months are MDMA/methylone, and one 4-HO-MET dose around 35-40mg perhaps 6 weeks ago. That experience was not very visual, it was mostly limited to open-eye visual disturbances (intensification of patterns, breathing of walls/objects etc.) and more open, fluid, complex conversation. It must be noted that I have 4-HO-MET Fumarate, which due to the large counterion (salt) has a dose approximately 50% higher than 4-HO-MET HCl. No other drugs were taken during the experience, though a very small quantity of cannabis around t+8 reduced body discomfort slightly, and a substantial amount of vodka (~350ml) was drunk before dosing (which most likely led to the mistake in the first place, though may have aided in the lack of fear felt during the experience).<!--   End Body   -->

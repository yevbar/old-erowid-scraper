12:50AM<BR>
-------<BR>
        OK, so its actually the 18th now. So what. I haven't gone to sleep<BR>
yet, so its the 17th as far as I'm concerned. Anyway...<BR>
        I have 2.5 tablets of Propacet, each containing 50mg of <BR>
dextropropoxyphene. They're the last of a batch of 8 of them that I was<BR>
given. I ingest all of them. I had smoked a little cannabis earlier, still<BR>
feel a lingering effect, but am close to baseline.<BR>
<BR>
1:09AM<BR>
------<BR>
        I begin to feel a hint of opiate feel kicking in. I also seem to<BR>
be feeling random itches all over my body, but they are easy to ignore.<BR>
This is a typical opiate alert for me. I feel slightly warm, a little<BR>
'floaty,' and real calm. Not much else yet. Narcotics seem to take a long<BR>
time to take effect orally.<BR>
<BR>
1:21AM<BR>
------<BR>
        The itching passed several minutes ago. But other than that, there<BR>
has been no change. I almost even feel closer to baseline than at my last<BR>
check-in. I'm yawning a little now though.<BR>
<BR>
1:45AM<BR>
------<BR>
        Well, I definitely feel 'something' - basically the same as I have<BR>
been feeling, but its moved up a level of intensity. Its tempting at this<BR>
point to smoke some cannabis to bring on the effects. I'm holding off<BR>
though, so I can get a good description of an unclouded dextropropoxyphene<BR>
experience. But damn... this slow come on time is a negative in my<BR>
opinion. I would hate to have to wait this long if I were using it for<BR>
pain relief!<BR>
<BR>
2:10AM<BR>
------<BR>
        T+1:20 and it still hasn't really kicked in yet. This is taking an<BR>
unusually long time. I haven't eatin in 11 hours or so, so my stomach<BR>
wasn't full. I feel slightly more than I did at last check-in. Same<BR>
effects again, just a little stronger. A kind of warm tingly sensation<BR>
diffused throughout my upper body and somewhat in my legs. A feeling of<BR>
calmness. Somewhat quieted thought processes. But I'm not yet feeling the<BR>
euphoria or the 'buzz' yet.<BR>
<BR>
2:15AM<BR>
------<BR>
        As I typed that last paragraph, things did jump up a level. The<BR>
body tingles increased alot, and spread all over my body. There is some<BR>
tinnitus in my ears now. Every now and then I get random itches, which has<BR>
been going on since I felt the first hint of effects. I'm developing a<BR>
decent 'buzz' and some euphoric sensations now as well. <BR>
<BR>
2:30AM<BR>
------<BR>
        Things still seem to be building, but I'm at a pretty decent level<BR>
now. I feel typical opiate effects, though sort of mild. As I said,<BR>
narcotics are very different from other CNS depressants. Its hard to<BR>
compare this high to something like GHB or alcohol.<BR>
        I feel a little warm, its a pleasant warmth. My body feels a sort<BR>
of tingly, floaty sensation. I feel much lighter than usual. I don't feel<BR>
like moving around at all. I tried to lay down, though, and that wasn't<BR>
noticably more comfortable than sitting in my computer chair or standing.<BR>
It doesn't seem to matter what position I'm in, I'm equally comfortable.<BR>
Its a comfortableness that seems to come primarily from not caring about<BR>
things that might normally make me uncomfortable. My thought processes are<BR>
slow... I'm a verbal thinker, and the voice in my mind is much quieter<BR>
than normal. Its not that thought is impaired, I *can* think if I want<BR>
to... it just seems nicer to not think though. Opiates are a very<BR>
detatched high. You just want to float around feeling calm, not doing or<BR>
thinking. Its not that you feel unusually happy - you just feel mentally<BR>
relaxed and physically good. Personally I find it sort of boring, but I<BR>
can see how this state would appeal to alot of people, especially those<BR>
with escapist tendencies. Music is slightly enhanced. Orbital's 'Halcyon<BR>
On & On' sounds prettier than usual, and goes well with the floaty<BR>
sensations. Other minor effects... I have dry mouth, but its different<BR>
than cannabis 'cottonmouth.' I was pretty hungry before I took the pills.<BR>
The hunger vanished within a half hour or 45 minutes or so and hasn't<BR>
returned. The itching is still somewhat there, but its so easy to ignore<BR>
as to be a non-issue. Its concentrated on my scalp, face and arms now,<BR>
though, whereas earlier it was all over. My juice tastes bland.<BR>
<BR>
2:50AM<BR>
------<BR>
        Its been 2 hours... peak plasma concentrations of<BR>
dextropropoxyphene are supposedly reached at 2-2.5 hours, and I do feel as<BR>
though I've gotten as far as I'm going to. There doesn't seem to be<BR>
anymore sensation of increase in the effects. I'm kind of bored of the<BR>
high already. Narcotics just don't do all that much for me on their own.<BR>
I've been wanting to smoke some cannabis, but haven't yet because I wanted<BR>
to write an accurate report of an unclouded narcotic high. I think I've<BR>
accomplished that.<BR>
<BR>
3:00AM<BR>
------<BR>
        I smoke some cannabis. One hit from my glass pipe and I'm already<BR>
feeling much nicer. Yes, I think this is what was needed.<BR>
<BR>
3:15AM<BR>
------<BR>
        The cannabis made a huge difference. I can feel the effects of<BR>
both blended into a fuller high than the dextropropoxyphene alone. The<BR>
cannabis also made me think more vocally again, and the combination makes<BR>
mellow music AMAZING! It is making me a little sleepy though. Neither drug<BR>
seems to dominate the high, its an even synergy, at least at these<BR>
dosages.<BR>
<BR>
3:45AM<BR>
------<BR>
        I feel much the same as before, but the narcotic aspect of the<BR>
high is starting to taper off ever so slightly. I'm pretty tired and plan<BR>
to go to bed soon. This was interesting to actually document a narcotic<BR>
experience, but I've never really been a big fan of this class of drug.<BR>
I'd definitely do it again if I was given some more, although I'd combine<BR>
it right off with cannabis. Ah well...<!--   End Body   -->

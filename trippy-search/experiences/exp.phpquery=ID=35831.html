<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: 1500 mgs of Dimenhydrinate is considered an extremely high dose.]</FONT><br>
<br>
So I have done dramamine a lot. There was a period where I took at least 25 (50 mg) pills a day for a week. The week ended with me taking 40 of the pills and wakin up in a hospital 2 days later, but I recently did it again, and this is whut happened.<br>
<br>
I told my friend that I would do dramamine with him, and one day, we went to the drug store and got 2 boxes (dramamine, 50 mg pills, 36 in a box). There were these 2 girls over who didn't want to do them, but were there anyway. We wanted to c the one girl’s house so we were going to go over there and c it. I guess she has like an 81,000 sq. ft. house. My friend said he was gunna take a shower and then we were going to leave. As he took his shower I took 30 of the pills. I was talking to the girls while eating them, eating 6 at a time. This stuff is probally the worst tasting pill I have ever eatin. Then I waited.<br>
<br>
About 20-30 minutes later, my friend had gotten out of the shower and we were ready to go. I guess u can say I’m somewhut of a 'professional' dramamine user, I’ve eaten at least 500 of them, so I knew how it was going to affect me. I told my friend that I didn't no if I was going to be able to make it there and back, but we left anyway. As we were walking, I could feel it kicking in. I started to feel dizzy and like my body was heavy. I tried to light a cigarette a few times before I finally got it lit. We were about 5 minutes away from her house when I said I couldn't go any further. My body wasn't listening to me any more, and for the first time in my whole life, I wasn't able to walk in a straight line. Even with alcohol, I can control myself enough. I laid down on the sidewalk while he went and told the girls we weren't gunna be able to make it to their house. They were on bikes and further ahead of us. I could have sworn I saw my friend kissing the one girl, when I asked him about it the next day, he said he didn't. <br>
<br>
So we started to walk back to his house, this is when I started to peak. The next thing I remember I was walking up the driveway, my friend asked me 'Whut r u doing?' I told him I was going home, he looked at me and was like, 'That’s not my house...' I then noticed 2 little kids in the yard and they were looking at me, I felt a little dumb, but played it off like I knew that. <br>
<br>
I kept turning around and walking the other direction and my friend had to keep helping me find my way. My friend weighs about 100 lbs less then me and he only eat I think 22. We got back to his house, and this is where I kinda lost myself. <br>
<br>
We were gunna sleep in the tent my friend had in his back yard. We have been 'camping' in his back yard for months and tripping on things we heard about at the drug store, but that’s another report. All of a sudden, I got out of the tent, which wasn't easy by any means, and walked to the patio. My friend asked me whut I was doing. I told him I was 'Going to my dude’s house.' He asked me whut dude and I told him 'My dude Eric in shaker.' He told me that I was already there and that I needed to calm down. I guess I was saying 'I’m really fucked up' over and over again really loud and his parent’s window was right above us. I was trying to catch the bus in my friend’s back yard, telling him that the bus would be here any minute. I did this about 10 times before I realized whut was going on. <br>
<br>
For some reason, I kept thinking the girls were still there. There were times when I would forget my friends was next to me, and have long converstations with the two girls. My friend wasn't too fucked up, so he was kinda the voice of reason. <br>
<br>
This is when I came back to earth, I was out of it for about 2 hours. That’s usually how long I’m out of it when I do this. I looked out of the window in the tent and I saw it pouring rain. I asked my friend if it was raining and he said no. This repeated about 5 times before he showed me that it was fine outside. We got up and went to his patio where he had a fire pit. He made a fire and we sat there and hanging out. It was about 1 am now, 4 hours or so after we had eatin them. I got up to go to get my cigarettes from the tent, and when I was walking off the patio, the ground didn't look the same as it usually did when I’m sober. I was having problems walking around becuz the ground looked so much different, and this for some reason threw me way off. <br>
<br>
The problem with cigarettes, I’m always smoking a cigarette, when ever I want a cigarette I have one, however once the cigarette gets to about halfway it disappers. This is the one thing I can count on whenever I do this drug. Even if I hardly experiance nothing, I will have problems with cigarettes. The other thing that is always happening, is that I talk on the fone. I have long conversations about things I may not no about (I was talking to my girlfriend once on the fone for like 2 hours about gone with the wind, I have never seen the movie, but she was telling me about it). This can be very unnerving to other people watching me. I will have a fone in my hand, talking to someone and having a serious converstaion, however everyone else see's pretendin to have a fone in my hand, talking nonsense. <br>
<br>
My friend told me I was constantly telling him to roll the blunt up, bugging to hell out of him. He kept telling me, and at one point, started yelling, that we don't have any weed and that we have no money. I started to break down my own weed (which wasn't there) and roll up my own blunt (which wasn't there either). I then grabbed a box from the side of me, and started taking things out of it. My friend said it was the funniest thing he has ever seen. <br>
<br>
When I started to have control over my hallucinations, I told my friend to call the dealer up and get some weed fronted to us. I was tripping and knew it so I wasn't sure he would even call, or that we would get some. Amazingly enough, the guy came through at 3 30 in the morning to give us a 5 sack. We smoked it and then went to sleep, where I had crazy dreams that I’m not able to remember. I felt tired and had tracers for the next 2 days, which is normal. <br>
<br>
I’m not telling no one to do this, even though this makes me higher then anything else, it is very dangerous. my ex gf got expelled from skool becuz she went on this and got caught (duh). My one friend almost got hit by a car when he was running from a '20 foot dog'.<!--   End Body   -->

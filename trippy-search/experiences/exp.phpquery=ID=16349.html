This occured during a vacation on Crete. I had brought 1g of Sceletium Tortuosum that I had bought from an online supplier, with me. After a bit drinking on the fourth night, me and my friend P, decided to break out the bag on the beach by the barstreet. We snorted a small pile off my credit-card each. It stung a little on the way, kinda like snuff-tobacco but worse. <BR>
<BR>
We went to the bar where our friends sat and I was really happy, laughing and joking with friends and unknowns. My perception was kinda fuzzy. I guess that the drug did something, but I can't put my finger on it since I was happy anyway(being on Crete isn't like an everyday situation). We proceeded to a couple other bars. I was on top of the world. We hooked up with a pair of girls we knew from our hotel. And we went to some nightclub. I found dancing really fun but much harder than usually. The rhythm wasn't there. Anyway me and P decided we should go to the bathroom and try a larger amount of sceletium to see what happens.<BR>
<BR>
The toiletdoor was broken and couldn't be locked so P had to hold the door while I poured the rest of the bag on top of the toilet. I made two really fat lines and snorted one of them...<BR>
<BR>
PAIN!! I've never felt more intense pain in my whole life than when the stuff hit the inside of my nose! I tried to blink the tears out of my eyes but I couldn't. Then I held the door trying to keep the burning in my head under control while P took his line. I've never seen an expression more painful than the one on his face when he was done..  It was kinda enjoyable though in a twisted, perverted way.<BR>
<BR>
After we stumbled out of the toilet it took about 15 minutes till the pain had subsided a little so I could order a beer without making strange faces. After my beer we went home to the hotel, because P was too confused to be around people he said. <BR>
<BR>
 As to the psychoactive qualities, I'm sure they were enjoyable but it's hard to tell.. <BR>
I'd definately try this again, it was fun. And the pain wasn't that bad.. It was a different type of pain than the normal pain, we call it the divine pain.  I wonder if it is possible to ingest this orally. Next time I'll get the 2X extract and maybe not take that much at one time.<!--   End Body   -->

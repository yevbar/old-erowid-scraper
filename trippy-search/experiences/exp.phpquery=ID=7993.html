Well, I had been on the outlook for some Ecstacy for a while, and I was really happy when a friend dropped by to tell me he had a few pills called roosters, so I bought them off him.<BR>
<BR>
Later that evening, me and 4 people sat down at my house to drop them, all the usual preparations were made, calm psychedelic music, bottles of water, salty crackers, the works, nothing unusual there.<BR>
<BR>
We dropped them all at the same time and began to wait, just chatting away. Well, about 40 minutes later, I was beginning to feel nauseous, not like the mild nausea with E, but really nauseous. I have a hard stomach though, so I didn't puke, perhaps I should've.. A couple of my friends raced to the bathroom and puked their guts out big time though, and about at the same time I began to feel unusual feelings, not like on MDMA in any way.<BR>
<BR>
My muscles tensed up and my legs started twitching, I got a bit dizzy, like with alcohol intoxication, and my hearing changed somewhat, my ability to localize sounds was impaired. If someone to my right spoke 10 meters away, I would think he was 1 meter away to the left.<BR>
<BR>
It just got worse and worse, and my heartbeat picked up big time, I was cold-shivering and hot-shivering at the same time, and my head just literally pounded with every heartbeat.. By now I was really panicky, I felt like I was insane, I had paranoid thoughts racing through my mind at crazy speeds and I had no way to control them.<BR>
<BR>
I called a few mates I know who are very experienced with all kinds of drugs and they tried to help me with the usual things to do, 'eat something, take a shower, mellow down, change the setting' .. but nothing seemed to work, and I was in real panic and kept considering calling 911 because I was sure I was going to die.<BR>
<BR>
I had mild visuals as well, distorted lights, patterns and colours as well.<BR>
<BR>
Stupidly enough, I sat down at my computer to find some info on bad chemicals usually contained in ecstacy, and I wound up at one explaining PMA, and I quickly related to everything written there, which only made things worse, since I had heard so many bad things about it.. Well, luckily I was able to control myself and satisfy my mind with that it I wouldn't stay this way forever, I would eventually come down.. and I did, with some new experiences learned.<BR>
<BR>
I learned control over my mind before my body.<BR>
<BR>
I learned how to handle myself in panic situations.<BR>
<BR>
and last but not least, I got a very important lesson about how dangerous things sold under the name Ecstacy really can be. It's not all love and euphoria.<BR>
<BR>
I really do not dare to think of what the consequences might have been if I had been in different settings, like at a rave party, I'm completely sure I would have died in that case.<!--   End Body   -->

12:00pm 300mg of Wellbutrin SR<BR>
9:30pm 300-350mg of DXM<BR>
10:00pm 3 hitters<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm 20 years old and currently live in the dorms. Ok, this is was the first time I had ever done DXM before in my life. For the longest time I was curious about DXM because I had heard about it before. I had just gotten off from work and my buddy R. comes in and says for me to smoke up with him. He said that we should try some DXM because it'll make the weed more effective. So we went into my friend's room and I took what I thought was only 150mg. Rob took 600mg (keep in mind he is 6ft. 6 and weighs 330lbs). I took it at around 8:45pm.<BR>
<BR>
At the time I had a long day and was relieved to see it over with. It was on valentine's day and that puts me in a rotten mood because I can't stand valentine's day (personal reasons). Earlier in the day I had taken 300mg of Wellbutrin (buproprion). I took the Wellbutrin at around noon. I know and knew then that buproprion reacts very strongly to other drugs (pot, LSD, alcohol etc...). It appears to serve as a multiplier (for example it would take me 10 drinks to get tipsy instead of 16-17). I wouldn't say I really made any preparations for DXM that night because I had planned on smoking all the pot I had left and mixing up the remainder of cocaine (Or what I thought was cocaine, I later found some dipshit had pulled a prank and put something else in instead) I had. The DXM was a last minute decision.<BR>
<BR>
So we took the powder form of DXM, mixed it up with pink lemonade and downed our drinks (which tasted absolutely horrible I might add). At around 9:30 the dose started to kick in and I was feeling funny. I decided to go downstairs for a cigarette and all of a sudden when I was starting my second cigarette my friend R. comes down. He says to me 'Pat I didn't just come down for a cigarette, I came down because by the time all that DXM kicks in you're gonna need to be carried upstairs'. I found out that I had actually taken 350-400 mg instead of 150mg. At first I was nervous and then in my infinite wisdom I decided that we should smoke pot now before the whole dose kicks in. At this time I was feeling very strange, I was beginning to feel numb in my head and I was feeling like I was starting to join another plane of thinking.<BR>
<BR>
We went outside and the DXM was really starting to kick in. I was definitely out of it and feeling very strange in my body. I almost felt as if I was dreaming and the lights that light up the pathways outside my dorm between the other dorms were looking very strange. We went to our usual spot and packed a few hitters. After the 3rd one we both decided we had enough and started to head back and that was when the full dose and the pot, and in my case the reaction with my meds kicked in and my reality was totally altered. I was starting to hallucinate and I was seeing doubles of everything. Shapes and regular images that I normally see were drastically altered. We had a cigarette before heading in and the cigarette tasted very strange.<BR>
<BR>
Emotionally I was fairly nervous because I was not expecting the trip to be this intense at all. While we were outside we bumped into some of my friends I see outside and according to them later on me and my friend were making no sense at all. We decided to finally head upstairs back to our floor and at this time emotionally I knew I had emotions but I couldn't tell exactly what I was feeling. Physically I damn well knew I was on a trip unlike anything I have ever experienced in my life.<BR>
<BR>
When we went in everyone on the floor we were friends with knew how messed up we were and me and R. went our separate ways to our rooms. I went into my room and tried to play video games which was a very interesting experience because my vision was so altered that it seemed as if I was playing the games in my dream and I was seeing whole objects that weren’t even there. The games got boring very fast and I decided to go and wander around the floor.<BR>
<BR>
At this time my buddy R. broke out in hives and they threw him into a cold shower. At this time a few people on the floor freaked out and said we had gotten way too messed up for our own good and unfortunately I payed attention to them so I started to freak out myself. I called my friend T. who had given me the DXM at his work and he reassured me I would be just fine. After I got off the phone with him I has to use the washroom and when I tried to urinate I was like 'what the Hell, I can't go at all'. I closed my eyes, looked at the graffiti that has been etched into the stall walls and I knew my vision was screwed because words that were small looked big, words that were big looked small (Simply put, my depth perception was nonexistent). I closed my eyes again, got spooked by the closed eye visuals and looked at the stall walls again and the letters started to rearrange themselves.<BR>
<BR>
While I was in the stalls I could hear people talking but it seriously felt like I was on a totally different wavelength than they were. It was as if I was dreaming and that anything I said they wouldn't be able to be heared. After a while everything looked like it was melting down, I freaked and ran out of the bathroom and decided to call my very close friend K. I knew she had tripped before and at the time I needed the closest friend possible to keep me grounded because I was beginning to get really nervous at this time.<BR>
<BR>
I called her up at around midnight and she met downstairs, she decided that since she still had a lot of homework left to do she'd do it in my room so she can be near me while the DXM was still making me trip. I was hungry and decided to order food, I decided to pay by check and it was a miracle the delivery guy could even read my writing because my motor skills were impaired considerably. I got halfway through my food and threw it out because it looked very dull and I couldn't really taste them either. Emotionally I was feeling pretty good, I was just relaxed and enjoying my trip, not to mention enjoying the fact that I was making my roomate and few of my friends laugh hysterically at me and my stupidy I was showing that night. <BR>
<BR>
They seemed to enjoy playing minor pranks which were all light hearted and just for laughs and believe me, they made all of us laugh a lot. I didn't really start coming down until around 3am and by then K. had to go to sleep anyways so we went out for our last cigarette break. When we went back in, we talked for a bit and we hugged goodbye, it was then that I found out that she considers me her best friend up at NIU (the school I go to) and just a close friend overall. After hearing this and realizing that she had taken the time to look after me, I came to the realization I cared for her very much. Ever since that night I have realized I have liked her for a while. The rest of the night was relatively uneventful and the hallucinations didn't really slow down until about 4am and shortly after that I was asleep. When I woke up the next day I noticed I had lost a lot of my water-based fat from lack of hydration. When I look back at this trip, it was a very intense but fun experience. I knew then that I would try it again sometime shortly afterwards. <BR>
<BR>
I personally recommend against DXM if you take antidepressants of any type and also recommend against it until you've prepared yourself for one hell of a trip. Just be sure you're in a good state mentally and in a good mood because the trip will magnify your feelings in a big way. Be safe and have fun.<!--   End Body   -->

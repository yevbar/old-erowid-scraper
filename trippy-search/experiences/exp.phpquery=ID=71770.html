<!--   Start Body   -->


Age at time of experiences: 21<br>
Weight: approx. 135 lbs.<br>
Gender: Male<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I cannot recall the details of most of my experiences with 5-MeO-MiPT offhand, as I have ingested it somewhere around 10 times in not too long of a time period (approx. 2 or 3 months). It should be easy for me to summarize the primary effects that certain doses have on me, though.<br>
<br>
All doses:<br>
<br>
First effects are felt in about 15 minutes. Very little body load, even at 12mg.<br>
<br>
2-3mg (experienced 6 or 7 times):<br>
<br>
At this dose range, there is a definite relaxing effect. Music of all sorts is more enjoyable, and an ease of fantasy is present. Mostly clearheaded and definitely easy to be out in public on - interactions with other people is not an issue. General relief from anxieties and a minor positive mood push is also present. A minor body high is also present and very pleasurable. It also opens up my airways and makes me want to breathe much deeper than normal. A general 'stoned' feeling is also notable, but feels much cleaner than cannabis. Visual effects are practically non-existent. Sleep after 5 hours is difficult, but possible.<br>
<br>
4-6mg (experienced 2 or 3 times):<br>
<br>
All effects from the previous range are amplified. The positive mood shift is still prevalent. Music and other sounds open up, causing familiar songs to take on an entirely new meaning as if being rediscovered. Visualization to music is readily achieved with eyes closed, and I often feel abstract impressions (such as when listening to one song, I could imagine clearly a flat surface that would occasionally push upwards in some spots as if a needle was poking from below every time a piano note sounded). <br>
<br>
The relaxation turns into more of  a mind-set than a body thing at this point, where it feels like a lot of energy is present and flowing. I'll occasionally shudder from the pleasure and have a huge smile plastered on my face. Taking deep breaths often leads to this. Solitary sexual activities result in a very satisfying experience, with orgasm being markedly intense. No insight into life is gained, though insight and connections with people is sometimes felt. Particularly at this level, inspiration for art seems to occur, and while I normally work with black and white, this substance demands use of color. The stoned feeling from the previous level becomes much more intense, though public excursions still aren't uncomfortable. No increased connection with or appreciation of nature is experienced as I feel on most other psychedelics. Sleep is difficult to obtain for up to 7 hours post-ingestion.<br>
<br>
As far as visual effects go, they are still almost non-existent, though there was one notable exception during a 5mg trip. I was sitting down and out of the corner of my eye I saw a piece of string on the floor move. When I looked directly at it and it was perfectly still. I looked back the other direction and immediately the string was writhing on the floor - an absolutely clear OEV. I looked directly at it again - perfectly still. This was repeated with success until I lost interest.<br>
<br>
12mg (experienced once)<br>
As before, but body effects and stoning become strong enough that walking is a bit odd (though not difficult). Visual effects become apparent, with mild rippling on surfaces and mild color intensification. CEVs are not much more apparent than at the 4-6mg range, though are perhaps a bit more active. Positive mood-shift results in a permanent smile plastered on the face. Communication is not difficult. Sleep was just as difficult as previous dose range.<br>
<br>
Specific to this experience, there were a couple of things of note. Extreme reduction of anxiety, to the point that things that would normally make me feel very uncomfortable were smile-worthy (such as a car slowing down to watch me and my group of friends walking down the street late at night). At one point, I walked past a very large oak tree that seemed to be radiating strength and power. I was very much in awe of it - it did not appear either friendly nor menacing, just extremely powerful. Unfortunately, I only saw it in passing as I had to keep up with the rest of the group.<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
5-MeO-MiPT has been an enjoyable substance, though I do not think I will be acquiring any in the near future again. It doesn't have much depth to it (though most of my friends love it). My favorite dose range has been 2-3mg, where the experience is more of a coloring of the day than a commanding experience. It has proven very useful when I wish to really enjoy music - as a matter of fact, I would say that is the best aspect of the experience, and probably the only reason I would purchase any more (though I experiencing sexual activities with another person could possibly persuade me). It's fun, it's relaxing, but it's not enlightening or particularly exceptional. I like to look for the latter.<!--   End Body   -->

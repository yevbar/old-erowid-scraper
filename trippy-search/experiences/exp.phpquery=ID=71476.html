<!--   Start Body   -->


I was bored last night and I didn't want to go to bed, so I did my occasional routine of taking some speed and staying up all night. I also had a nice fat bowl of purple haze, and a decent trip's worth of 15x salvia leaves. I'll put the night into timeline form so it stays organized. I started at about 8:00pm<br>
<br>
T+0:00; I popped four of my 5mg Adderall pills and went out to walk the dog. I brought my weed and a nice little bubbler.<br>
<br>
T+0:20; I sat down at my usual spot and smoked a very large bowl, taking small, controlled hits which I made sure to hold for at least 45 seconds each. No hint of the Adderall yet, but I knew it will kick in soon.<br>
<br>
T+0:25; I was fucking baked off my ass at this point, and hadn't even finished my bowl (like I said, it was a fat bowl.)<br>
<br>
T+0:30; I could feel the first effects of the Adderall, which mixed very nicely with the weed high.<br>
<br>
T+0:40; I was back in my room, listening to music. I couldn’t believe how stoned I was (I seriously love purple haze. It is the best weed I’ve ever tried, and that’s saying something because I live in probably the biggest hippie town in the U.S) and the Adderall made the high feel much more lucid and less confusing, which was great. The only thing I don’t like about weed is the confused, paranoid feelings it can bring, and this felt like the opposite.<br>
<br>
T+1:00; I was now seriously tripping on this simple combination, giving me much, much stronger open-eye visuals than I’ve ever had on weed alone, along with a strong sense of euphoria. The edges of my vision were completely distorted, fading off into rainbow-colored geometric patterns. Even my focal point and the surrounding area only allowed me to see a world composed of glowing, reticulated patterns that seem to be pulsating or giving off energy. When I closed my eyes, I had the sensation of moving forwards at such an insane speed that I was compelled to open them for fear of blacking out. Music made it way more intense. The closest thing to it I’ve ever experienced was Morning Glory seeds (of which I ate about 200 last year, resulting in an amazing all-day trip which I plan to repeat soon). This might have even been stronger.<br>
<br>
T+1:10; Here’s where it starts to get insane. I checked my little stash to see if I had any Salvia left, which I did. There was a moderate bowl of extremely fine leaf powder left in the bottom of the bag. It would have been plenty for a strong trip even if I was sober. I turned off all the lights, except for my desk lamp, which left the room well-lit, but not overpoweringly so. I also turned off the music on my computer (by the way, I do not listen to music while on Salvia. No matter how soothing or calm it may sound normally, it sounds screwed-up, annoying and often scary on Salvia. Near or total silence seems best for me).<br>
<br>
T+1:15; Everything was ready for my journey. I loaded up my bowl, sat down in my tripping recliner and drained the entire bowl in one hit, making sure to keep the flame on it. I held it for as long as I could and waited for maybe 20 seconds. I did not experience the feeling of having my memory wiped like I usually do, but the effects were coming on strong. The first thing I noticed were the voices I always hear on Salvia, although not quite as pronounced as usual. I can always understand what they’re saying, even though it’s not any language known to me, and I never remember what they were saying when I come to. (I also usually get the sense that the voices belong to two or three different entities, although I’ve only encountered one once a long time ago. It looked really fucked up, but familiar at the same time). <br>
<br>
I then realized that I couldn’t tell if my eyes were open or closed. Everything around me was transforming into the now-familiar world of salvia, where directions, distance, proportion and logic all mean nothing. I always forget what this actually feels like, but it feels welcoming and familiar as soon as I take a hit. (I strongly suspect that the reason many people dislike Salvia is because they only try it a few times, and never get used to being in such an alien state). <br>
<br>
I got the familiar sense of feeling like I could see parallel dimensions, in which I can see myself clearly, and what looks like an entire series of me, my room and indeed, our entire known universe, seeming to repeat forever. This looks extremely similar to what happens when you line up two mirrors face-to-face, creating an “endless tunnel” of reflections, only the entire world looks like that, and each repetition is slightly different from the last. Usually they appear two-dimensional and rather flatly colored, but this time, everything had bright, neon colors, and It seemed almost even more 3-D than real life does (This is really hard to explain). Also, it seemed to only go one way, almost as if all the dimensions were all flowing in one direction (on a previous trip, this influenced me to walk in the direction of flow, going about five blocks before I even thought about what I was doing). <br>
<br>
Until this trip, I had never been able to see anything past maybe twenty such dimensions in the tunnel. I had always felt trapped in my own world. Not this time. I realized that, instead of feeling bound to my chair, I could simply float out of my body and charge down the tunnel of dimensions which seemed to each have their own special light spectrum, accelerating to seemingly impossible speeds, passing through innumerable worlds which grew increasingly strange. My lower jaw then detached, and seemed to become a part of the tunnel with the rest of my face slowly beginning to follow. Normally this would be a problem, but I simply focused, and managed to condense all the little bits and layers of my face back onto my head, as they appeared to be spread throughout thousands of universes. <br>
<br>
This was the first time I had ever accomplished anything like this. I used to constantly feel like I was being pulled apart, and if I tried to fight it, I would get seriously freaked out. Now I could control it and enjoy my trip without any of the discomfort normally associated with Salvia. The voices were becoming distracting, but I realized that if I listened to them, they were giving me useful information about how to go deeper. I was still at the peak of the trip, so I listened carefully. I don’t remember what they told me, as always, but I do know that they helped me go further down the tunnel. After that, they stopped. I could now see that it wasn’t just one tunnel, but a massive network that looked like worm holes from Star Trek or something. The tunnel was curving endlessly downward in a way that defied physics. I kept accelerating, and the G-forces felt impossibly powerful. I had to be careful not to touch anything, or I would feel myself connect to it and completely ruin the trip. <br>
<br>
Luckily, I felt like I was shooting through the tunnel so fast that it would be impossible to touch anything (imagine being in a car going 90mph, and trying to open a mailbox). It was like the most amazing roller coaster ever conceived. Eventually, it started to slow down and I was suddenly back in my chair, as if teleported. I could tell that I was in my room, but I could also still see some of the other-dimension things, and the room seemed to be moving in an inexplicable way. Eventually, even this wore off and I was left dumbfounded by what had just happened. It really did feel like I had just returned from outer space. <br>
<br>
I think that this is an almost perfect combo to use with salvia. The weed makes the trip seem even more real and exciting, and the Adderall helps prevent confused and mixed-up feelings, as well as improving concentration on the trip. I looked at the clock, and realized that the entire trip had lasted about ten minutes, which is actually pretty long for a Salvia trip. It still feels more like several hours each time.<br>
<br>
T+1:30; I was left with the carefree sense of wellbeing and peace which usually lasts a few days after a Salvia trip. This combined extremely well with being stoned.<br>
<br>
T+1:40; At this point, I had a fresh new positive outlook on life, and was filled with recently acquired gusto and enthusiasm. Although Adderall normally suppresses my appetite to the point of rejecting any sort of food even when I’m stoned, I guess the Salvia trip affected me positively enough to over-ride this. I went down to the kitchen at about 10:00 and made an entire medium-sized pizza which I consumed within five minutes. Even if Salvia had no psychoactive properties, I would use it just for the way I feel afterwards. Every time I do it, my life seems to improve a little.<br>
<br>
T+2:00; The weed high was now wearing off, as was the Adderall. I took some more to avoid crashing and waking up at 3:00pm the next day because school started late and getting three hours of sleep is far worse than none at all for some reason.<br>
<br>
T+3:30; The weed was completely gone, but I was satisfied with the experience I’d already had. I continued to take Adderall throughout the night at a rate of 5mg every three hours, in the morning, I took one with a time release, to get me through the day.<br>
<br>
Summary: This was simply the best trip (or drug experience of any kind) that I’ve ever had. I don’t know if other people will get the same effects, as Salvia is a pretty unpredictable drug, but I know I’m doing it again. I’ll probably try it with alcohol as well, I’ve heard that it’s very enjoyable. I honestly believe that Salvia is best mixed with other, carefully chosen drugs, as it can be too frightening without some kind of “softener.”<!--   End Body   -->

<!--   Start Body   -->


Over the past four years I have experimented with a decent amount of<br>
psychedelics and hallucinogens, including marijuana, cocaine, LSD, LSA,<br>
5-MeO-DMT, Opium, PCP, DXM, Ketamine, Salvia D, Ecstasy, MDMA, Psilocybin mushrooms, GHB, morphine, Oxycotin, Percocets, Codeine, et cetera. Just recently I added 2C-T-7 to the growing list. I have had a yearning interest in entheogens for a while but thought drugs like 5-MeO-DMT, 2C-T-7, and 5-MeO-DiPT were just like legends and I had no way of getting my curious little paws on them.<br>
<br>
A few weekends ago, my SO and I got into a slight falling out and he called me and apologized. We worked things out and he offered me some 2C-T-7. He said he wished he could be there with me taking it because it would make me even touchy-feelier than on Ecstasy. A little background information – I’m eighteen years old, in my last year of high school. I have this thing, I can’t really explain it but I can’t hang out with girls or even really talk to them. I prefer to do my drugs with the boys, even though they have a hard time keeping up to me. I am a female, with a weight of 112 pounds and a height of 5 feet seven inches. Relatively healthy, I eat my basic food groups; exercise with weights three times a week and do cardio seven days a week. I’m currently not on any medications other than the birth control patch, Evra. But, on with the trip…. <br>
<br>
8:55 – Arrive at my good friend Deez (as he would like to be called). Other associates Homeless and G are chilling, smoking some high quality cannabis. I will be the only one taking 2C-T-7. All the others are taking Yellow Mazda press Ecstasy, supplied by me. I parachute 5-6mg of the powder with a tissue. We smoke a five piece in my tiny spoon pipe. I am looking forward to the buzz, but slightly apprehensive about just not getting high off the 2C-T-7 at all. We’re watching the movie Sister Act for some strange reason. All are relatively bored. <br>
<br>
9:58 – I am starting to get cold shivers, similar to LSD shivers. Deez and Homeless have started to hit lines of Ecstasy. We smoke another bowl. A slight mind-numbing sensation comes over my body as I feel the smoke heavy in my mouth. Certainly some high-quality buds. <br>
	<br>
10:30 – Jolly has been added to the group. He is just returning from work. He finds the boys immersed in Ecstasy Talk (y’know, blabbering on and on about the most personal things to people who don’t care, they just want to tell you their most personal things, ha ha) and me a jibbering mess with my chair turned in the corner, muttering and giggling about sex. So far, I have smoked about two hundred cigarettes (jokes, but you get the idea). Jolly is interested in my 2C-T-7 but wants to hit lines of E and paintball the bus. I tell him he’s ridiculous. Jolly also recently tried the 5-MeO-DMT and loved it. G is a loser and will be leaving soon hopefully. I do a small bump of the 2C-T-7, about the size of a match head. <br>
<br>
10:40 – Spent ten minutes looking for a lighter that was in my lap the whole time. Starting to get very high. G is leaving thankfully. He has a curfew. I have started dreads in my hair using the backcombing method just for the 2C-T-7 trip. I keep getting interrupted. My mindset is of a child – absolutely entranced and enthralled by everything. I had a new appreciation for the way the light glittered off the empty beer bottles. The cherry of any cigarette or joint would flare out in these beautiful little mysterious whips of fire, interesting me enough to burn myself more than once. I have the biggest urge to call my dealer and have sex with him. I settle for touching my dreads. Very cold, kind of, sort of.<br>
<br>
11:32 – Tripping balls, if I may say so. The guys want to go skateboarding. I take a quick inventory of how everyone’s buzzes are doing. <br>
<br>
&#61609;	Deez – “Nice E buzz rockin’,”<br>
&#61609;	Homeless – “Burnt out bullshit, slightly tipsy, smoking weight in cigarettes.”<br>
&#61609;	Jolly – I can’t read what I recorded for him, my buzz was stronger than my motor skills, but he’s unimportant.<br>
<br>
The boys have demolished their way through four pills of E so far.<br>
<br>
12:00 – Taking the bus home so early was rough but awesome. I felt every single vibration ringing through my body. The peak of my buzz is over, or so I believe. As I get off the bus with Homeless, I smoke one more bowl with him and head to my house. <br>
<br>
12:45 – I plop myself down on the computer and immediately realize that I keep seeing headlights inside my room, police lights, ambulance lights, all sorts of headlights. I look to my windows and see the blinds shut tight. Awesome, hallucinations.  I put on all my System Of A Down albums. Then something strange (but certainly not unpleasant) happened – Every time the drums hit really hard in one of System’s insane beats, I had a mini-orgasm. That would be the best way to describe it. My whole body was erupting in millions of tiny fizzing orgasms! <br>
<br>
I smoked a pack and a half of cigarettes throughout the night, and I kept snapping them out of my fingers. I found an increased appreciation for everything pink. Then, out of nowhere, at about 4 am or close to it, I yawned once, realized that I really liked the 2C-T-7 but I wanted to go to sleep. I had a beautiful little giggling spell right before I fell asleep. The sensation of my silk sheets was amazing against my body.<br>
<br>
I woke up the next day feeling awesome and happy. I haven’t noticed any bad after effects – I could sleep on it, eat on it, function semi-normally on it. Now to get my hands on some more for tomorrow night!<br>
<br>
----- Note - Perils of mislabelled chems - I was under the awareness that I was doing 2C-B, but my dealer informed me that I was doing 2C-T-7. He gave me the correct dose, but for some reason I had it in my mind that it was 2C-B. He had informed me that it was 2C-T-7, but for some reason I had it mixed up with 2C-B. What an idiot I feel like!<!--   End Body   -->

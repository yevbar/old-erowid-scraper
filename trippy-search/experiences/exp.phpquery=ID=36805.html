<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: 210 mgs of amphetamine is considered an extremely high dose, especially in combination with another stimulant. See Amphetamine Dose Chart.]</FONT> <br>
<br>
I was at a friend's house, and she has scripts for Methylphenidate and Amphetamine [both generic] that we had decided to use recreationally. I had never taken close to as much as I have in this report In the experiance described in this report, I had a true high. Previously, I had only taken modest amounts Amphetamine [30mg-100mg], and gotten little buzzed. I had never taken Methylphenidate before.<br>
<br>
T+0:00 -- To start off, I snorted a line made up of 1 pill of Amphet (30mg) and 1 pill of Methylphenidate (5mg). My nose was stuffy, and it was pretty foolish/careless of me to do. I should have rethought that. <br>
<br>
T+0:10 -- I felt a tiny bit from the pills I insnufflated before. Not really a rush, or a burst, but just a jumpy feeling. Mild hyperactivity, I suppose, with a bit of paranoia. I jumped at my reflection in the mirror.<br>
<br>
T+0:20 -- I'm normal again. Surprise, surprise. I take another 2 Methylphenidate pills [total 10mg] and 1 of Amphetamine [30mg], this time the pills were broken in half, and swallowed orally. This is how I'll be taking the pills for the remainder of night.<br>
<br>
T+0:25 -- Still feeling normal, as I only swallowed the pills 5 minutes ago. After thinking for a bit after I swallowed the pills,  I just decided I want to get really 'tweaked' or high, whatever you'd like to call it, I just wanted to get more than the small buzz I had originally dosed for. So I swallowed another 3 pills Methylphenidate [total 15mg] and planned on another 3 more for later. I took 3 Amphets [total 90mg] planned on another 2 [total 60mg] for later.<br>
<br>
T+0:40 -- I don't feel anything from the pills I took at +0:20 or +0:25 yet. I had eaten lunch 4 hours prior. My stomach felt 'normal', like in the middle. I'm not nearly full or stuffed, but I have something in there. I'm not on a totally empty stomach, but it's empty enough. I anticipate the pills will be kicking in soon.<br>
<br>
T+0:50 -- I feel the smallest inkling of a rush. I have the mild hyperactivity back from before, but on top of that is a tiny rushing feeling. The first group of pills I ate was kicking in. I took the 15mg Methylphenidate and 60mg Amphetamine I planned on at +0:25. I promised myself no more, and repeated it a few times to make sure I didn't pop more on impulse when I'm tweaking.<br>
<br>
T+1:00 -- I now fully feel the +0:20 dose and the +0:25 dose. I am on a speed/ritalin high, and it is recognizable. It's not a small feeling like +0:50, I'm now starting to really feel it.<br>
<br>
T+1:20 -- It's an hour since I first started seriously taking the pills, as opposed to my dumb insufflation before. Bam! I'm rushing. I have just an incredible, almost indescribable feeling. The best way to put it into words is to says that I've just got a great rush, or a burst, of euphoria and energy and just general good feelings. I'm energetic, and euphoric.<br>
<br>
T+2:00 -- I'm peaking on the last dose I took. Great feeling. Like how I described at +1:20, but much, MUCH more intense. I've got a big smile on my face, I'm slightly jumpy [I jumped at my reflection again, but I laughed pretty hard after I realized it was alright]. I'm feel very alert, but it's not bad, as it's the alert feeling plus the huge rush, and not just a jumpy alert feeling. All the feelings [slight paranoia, alertness, euphoria] are working together to become a nice rush describable only as 'rushing'. But it's very intense. A huge rush. I'm hot, so I drink water. I feel perfect in a minute. It's obvious that I'm on something, very obvious. I'm not even close to normal. Adrenaline's rushing, too, so I'm also feeling good physically. The sort of feeling where I just want to yell 'WHOOOOOOOO!'<br>
<br>
T+2:30 -- Pretty much the same feeling as before. I think I had just reached the plateau before, and now I think I'm going to begin to come down soon.<br>
<br>
T+3:00 -- It is now 3 hours since I took the first tiny, uneffective dose, and 2:40 since I started to really take the pills. I'm coming down. I'm not 'crashing' or feeling worn out yet. It's just a less intense feeling than the one before. It's wearing off. I still feel pretty good.<br>
<br>
T+3:45 -- I still have remnants of the high. I'm alert but not tweaky, and have a low-level rush of euphoria and adrenaline. Very happy. <br>
<br>
T+4:20 -- I haven't 'crashed' as I thought I would, and I don't think I will. Maybe I'm just lucky tonight. The high is definitely starting to leave. I do feel a nice little buzz, a small fraction of what I felt before, but the feeling is fading away, and I'll be sober soon.<br>
<br>
T+5:00 -- A pretty minor 'crash'. I'm just a little tired, and I want some more, but I'm not going to get myself get into that.<br>
<br>
And that ended the trip. All in all, I think the mix was a great feeling, better than either alone. I don't even take speed by itself anymore because I find that it's just jumpyness and alertness with no rush. I'd do this again, I'd take more though. Not that the dose wasn't enough this time, but I just want to work my way up and experience more and more. It's a wonderful mix of drugs for an occasional recreational break from reality, and it was pretty fun.<!--   End Body   -->

time of ingestion: 8:33 am<BR>
mood: Stress, and depression<BR>
<BR>
It was a tuesday morning and for reasons I would rather not say I decided to take 72 pills of equate motion sickness tablets. I have tripped on dramamine numerous times and had come to the point where at times taking 20 pills I would trip hard and others nothing at all. This time I felt like I wanted to trip and never come back (which for the most part I achieved.) I began to fill my hand with the white pills and proceeded to pop them in my mouth. After three handfuls I began to feel sick. To stay awake I took 8 mini thins. I remember my mother calling me into her room to talk to my father who was on the phone. This had occured more or less than 45 minutes of the dosage. I was sitting on the bed speaking with my father and everything hit me all at once. The walls started taking on that 'jello' consistancy, but this time it seems much more colorful. I heard a voice coming out of the wall and realized that I was on speaker phone with my father. <BR>
<BR>
'Dad, I have to go. I love you and I'm sorry!' These words came out of my mouth and I hung the phone up.<BR>
<BR>
As I turned away from the phone the walls caught my eyes again. Now I have no clue as to how long I am into the trip but it's getting weird. The walls no longer seemed like walls, and for that matter my house didn't seem like my house. I was in a glassed submarine with jelly fish and squid floating around me. Well, I decided it was best to be alone since at anytime anything could happen. I had some difficulty getting on my feet, but alas I was on the long 20 foot journey to my room. My feet kept sinking into the carpet with lighting bolts coming with each step I took. It is incredible hard to focus when on dramamine. The door looked as if it was grainy TV displaying a door. 'Excuse me sir, would you happen to know where I could find....' The voice trialed off but it came from inside my room. (I somehow get into my room. I can no longer walk.) The whole room is filled with people talking yet there is no one but me. I start looking at a box of clothes and my friend April's head rises out and she said, 'Parker, why did you have to do this? You know it's not good for you.' My reply was in the form of an affirmative nod. There are insects all over my walls and floor. The ceiling had a colorful boiling water type thing going on. Anything that was white had some types of creatures that looked like they had that camofluage the predator used. <BR>
<BR>
'HELP ME!'<BR>
<BR>
I was scared by this sudden scream. The voices kept going on accompanied by some type of neo classical music. I decided it was time to watch a movie. I crawled to my TV and turned it on, 'Just press play', this command came from somewhere but not sure. The movie was a porno but a VERY STRANGE one. The people were talking about what they had done today and how their days were (this was all going on while they are having sex for the camera.) In one scene this man started pulling all these office supplies out of this chicks hair while he's doing her doggy style. I turned away and started to talk to one of my friends. They disappeared when the phone rang. I had to pick up the phone and only remember it's Carly. There is big stretch of memory loss but I somehow get into the kitchen. I threw up this pinkish putty like vomit in the sink. <BR>
(No MEMORY after this point.)<BR>
<BR>
The next day I awoke shaky, delirious, and all around fucked up. I took the equate bottle and counted the pills, I only had 28 left from a new bottle. I called a couple of friends to tell them what happened, but they already knew. A few of them called me up during the experience and discovered me to be in a state of insanity. One said that in one point of the conversation I started to talk about a highway in the middle of a sentence, and that my speech had no focus or organization. I'm still not the same as I was before. I wonder why I did not die, but I'm glad I didn't. I no longer take dramamine for any reason.<!--   End Body   -->

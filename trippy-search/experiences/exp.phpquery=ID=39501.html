Hydromorphone. a yellow speck of heaven. Paradise encapsuled in turquoise. Bliss in red and green.<br>
<br>
To begin with, a little background info. I'm young[er] (mid-teens currently) than most of the report authors here I'm sure. I have an extremely limited history with psychoactives, partially due to lack of easily available substances and partially due to my own refusal of them. To put it best: I am not a 'psychonaut' or whatever buzzword is popular at any given time, but rather someone who hopes and plans to be well experienced later in life. I have experiences with hydromorphone (unable to tell how many times. quite a few), oxymorphone (10-15), codeine (10-15), dxm (2), cannabis (1). I also smoke tobacco occasionally, and drink alcohol very very seldomly. My current reluctance to try many psychoactive substances has to do in large part with my history with depression. I would obviously much rather be in a better overall state of mind. NOTE: along with my depression, I also have suffered from compulsive self-injurous behaviour, hinting at a rather adictive personality.<br>
<br>
It began when a family member had been prescribed a new pain killer for their cancer related discomfort. I had a shallow knowledge of the feeling opiates produce, so I was intriqued by this new little pill. After all, 'morphone' must come from 'morphine' and what pharmacutal pain killer is stronger than morphine to the uneducated mind? The very same night I first saw it, was the very first time I used it. No one was in the house except for myself and the family member and they were well asleep. With no need to be up early in the morning, there was no better time like the present. <br>
<br>
First of all, it was incredibly irresponsible of me to use this without any prior research. Luckily everything turned out fine, but I still feel ashamed for being reckless. I made the assumption that I would need a few times more of the medication than the medicinal dose to gain desirable affects; therefore I grabbed 4 of the extremely small red 2mg pills. This amount was unnecissary I'm sure, as with no prior use, the medical dose would probably have done quite fine.<br>
<br>
I got comfortable in bed with the tv on, and promptly swallowed done the four pills at once with one gulp of water. Then I pushed it from my mind, focused on the Late Show and let the chemical run it's course. About 40 minutes after swallowing them, I felt their effects coming on, noticably in my vision slightly blurring. I continued watching television for about another 40 minutes or so (T + 1:20) until it's radiant glow served no purpose for me to gain entertainment.<br>
<br>
I turned off the light and slid myself deep beneath the covers. The feeling was like that of stepping into a warm bath after being out in the snow. Warmth was poured all over me, but rather, from the inside; as if something in the centre of my chest was melting and letting it's warm liquid ooze through my body into my extremeties. Needless to say, I was beaming. I laid there on my back wide eyed and moaning in pleasure for the next 2 and a half hours (though, it felt 3 x as long). I was amazed how my mind wandered in the near sleep states the drug produced. I was even more amazed at the surge of physical pleasure that went through me every time I woke from this state. As the effects tapered off and the itchiness appeared, I drifted off to sleep and awoke late the next morning, feeling a little groggy and knowing that I had just made a very good friend.<br>
<br>
Since then I have taken hydromorphone countless times. Sometimes I will go weeks without any use, and other times I'll be using everyday for as many as 4 days straight. There was even a period of time where I was using it 2-3 times a day. I take it orally, sublingually or insuflated, only really depending on whichever I feel most like doing.<br>
<br>
Now I don't get my desired results from any dose under 12mg, although I haven't taken long enough breaks in between doses to be able to tell if I could get my tolerance all the way down. Most often, I will binge for a week or so, due to the fact that I can only get a limited amount every so often. It's always a treat when I have some. Even so I wait a day or two between each dose. During this time I will usually reach doses of 16-28mg of hydromorphone. However I have consumed up to 48mg intranasally due to tolerance.<br>
<br>
Hydromorphone produces the same effects that one would expect from an opiate. However, it seems to produce different strenths of effects in me than it does in others. This includes both desirable and undesirable effects. The euphoria I experience from this drug is emmense. a large part of this probably has to do with how fun I find the experience as opposed to the drug's effects directly. I also find that while on HM, I am slightly dizzy and find it difficult to stay perfectly balanced when standing. However, I very rarely get out from bed when using the drug so it's not a problem. Itchiness is not usually a huge issue, although I interestingly find that it only becomes prominant as the drug's effects are wearing off. The worst of it's affects is the nausea it causes in me. I have never vomitted while actually on the drug, though it's become somewhat of an unhappy ritual to throw up each and every morning after. This could have something to with my substancial use and therefor could possibly be symptoms of withdrawl. Finally, the sedation is very minimal. More often than not, I find it extremely difficult to sleep while on the drug and soon after it's effects have worn off.<br>
<br>
In closing, I'd like to say to be careful. although there are no profound visions, no disaccosiation, and no loss of your ablity to make decisions; this can be very dangerous. The pills are easy to consume and therefor, can easily be taken in large amounts. Their small size may also fool some into taking dangerous amounts. Dont let size trick you, these things can pack a punch. Also, as I'm sure you can see from this report, they are obviously addictive.<br>
<br>
I feel that the good effects this drug produces outweigh the negative. The freedom of thought it gives has allowed me to overcome huge writing blocks and has given me the ability to learn some valuable things about myself and has let me relate better to others. Make your own choice.<!--   End Body   -->

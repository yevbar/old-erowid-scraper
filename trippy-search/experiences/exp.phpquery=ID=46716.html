Living outside of the infamous 'city of sin', I have ample access to any myraid of chemicals or indulgences I could possibly wish to indulge in. And this, seemingly being my big year of exploration, is the year that I decided to try methamphetamine for the first time. Not only meth, but I only started smoking pot early this year, so it's been a quick progression. Anything worth doing is worth doing right, right? <br>
<br>
I met the person I ended up doing it with through work. We only worked together about a week, then he mysteriously disappeared after I mentioned a vague interest in trying it for the first time. I pretty much lost interest, except for the random occassion when a more 'experienced' friend would mention it. Oddly enough, after 2 months of not seeing him at all, I ran into him during a lunch break at my job, he mentioned it and we exchanged numbers. It was that same night that I took the 'plunge'. When I tried meth, I had only dabbled in ganja smoking and a gram or two of cocaine, so I was (and presumably am still) a 'newbie'. My experienced friend kicked in with me and we got $35 worth, a bowl or two of which I smoked with the suppliers before going to her house.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, when I first tried it, I was naive as all hell. I knew it was addictive, so that scared the shit out of me, and I had seen the movie SPUN, so I had a mild idea of what I could possibly be getting myself into. They showed me how to load a bowl and how to smoke it, the two people I was with taking the first few hits before passing the pipe to me.<br>
<br>
The first thing I noticed was the taste. It tasted like I'd imagine Pinesol would smell (I unfortunately lack a sense of smell), and all I really felt was a mild head rush and my heart rate increased. I didn't know if it was from my own nervousness or the drug (now I know it's the drug). I also noticed how much easier it went down compared to pot, without any of the burn that I normally experience with weed. We probably smoked 2-3 bowls total, but it wasn't an overwhelming high, I just knew that I was AWAKE. I'd already been awake 16 or so hours when we got around to doing it, so I was pretty tired.<br>
<br>
After that, I went to my experienced friend's house. We talked for hours, and it was some of the best conversation we'd ever had, like coke, and we did 2 lines each over the course of the night, the first around midnight and the last ones around 4:30-5:00 am. Doing the lines hurt, there's no easy way around it. It felt like my nasal tissue was <i>literally</i> being eaten away, especially the second time. Around five, one of her friends who lives in the 'Big City' convinced us to go to his party, which was rather unexciting, but we stayed 5-6 hours anyway. Why not? We were awake and had nothing better to do, hah. <br>
<br>
After that, we returned to our little suburbia and parted ways. I was awake until 7:30 PM the next day, when I crashed HARD. That's the main reason I don't like meth. Outside of the fear of addiction, I HATE the comedown. Neither of us had any more after we did the 2nd lines, so all we really could do was come down, which I much prefer to 'binging', which I'm too afraid to ever do. I felt like shit by noon the next day, and I tried to eat with another friend of mine and couldn't get through half of a sandwich before I felt ill. All day I felt paranoid that someone could tell what was going on, and I was in an overall bad mood that kept getting worse. My dad asked me to go the store and I nearly had a breakdown because I was SO fucking TIRED and all I wanted to do was SLEEP and stop feeling so damn SHITTY. <br>
<br>
I've done meth a total of three or four times since then, usually going a week or more between each use, over two weeks this last time. I can see why people enjoy doing it, especially if they smoke it, but the comedown isn't worth it to me. I feel absolutely wretched for days afterwords, and refuse to EVER buy it for myself now. I'm just too afraid of addiction to use it with any frequency, and I like being relatively sober (outside of ganja smoking), so it's not something I see myself doing very often, if at all. I don't see much of an upside to it other than being awake all night and maybe losing some weight, but it's just not worth it to me.<!--   End Body   -->

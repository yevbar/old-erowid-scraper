A few nights ago, I had an absolutely insane experience with a bottle of Robotussin DX.<br>
This was my first dose of DXM, and after reading up o it, I was dying to give it a try.<br>
As my DXM was kicking in, I was chatting to a friend on the net, and as I came up to the second plateau, I killed the computer and lay on my bed listening to GOA Head (GOA and PSY Trance CDs).<br>
<br>
As per expected I appreciated the music a bit more, but nothing really special as I was lying on my bed still in a stationary environment with a steady stream of sound.<br>
<br>
Then, out of nowhere I got up to go to the toilet (down the hall), I looked to my right as I got up to look in my mirror and saw my own reflection - a dead body.  No shit.  I saw a lifeless human shaped piece of meat, my mind removed all previous assosiation from the object, and I just saw a lifeless zombie before me. - A Zombie that really needed to pee!  So I began the journey down the hall to the toilet...<br>
<br>
Space, size, objects, and depth meant bugger all to me at this time.  I get the feeling I was going hard into my third plateau as I was robowalking down the hallway towards the toilet door.<br>
<br>
I was alone walking through my darkened house at 3am with a storm outside - this was one of the most intense drug experience I have ever had.<br>
<br>
When I got to the door, I opened it slightly and turned the toilet light on and looked at the door and handle.  My GOD it seemed the door was huuuge, like the door was a massive cliff face and I was hovering hundreds of metres above the ground, my god that toilet door was whacky.<br>
<br>
the trip back down the hall was very strange in that the hallway seemed to be sloping uphill.  This was not correct.<br>
<br>
The second I got back to my bedroom, I got back in bed peered over the edge of my matteress to see a massive drop off the side of a cliff to see my socks far below!<br>
<br>
I vaguely remember laughing at myself for being so mashed and still being sane enough to listen to my favorite CDs.  That night was so much fun.<br>
<br>
The other thing I love about DXM is the fact that the comedown (if timed right) can be slept off and the amazing feeling I get when I wake up after a good hard DXM trip, how changed I felt.<br>

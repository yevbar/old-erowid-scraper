This is the most incredible drug experience I have ever had in my entire life. The story starts on Friday night.  I am going to describe the setting of the trip first to let you know why I thought I might have a bad trip.<BR>
<BR>
I was at the mall looking to find some LSD. I was talking to my dealer. J said he could get me 20 hits of LSD from his dealer who was also at the mall for $80. I said okay, and he went to talk to his dealer. About two minutes later, another guy came up, and said he could do 15 hits of DOM for $80. I thought that this was the same person I was going through, so I went ahead and did it. I had never heard of DOM before, but this guy said it was better than acid, so we went into the stall in the restroom and dealt the stuff. There were 15 sugar cubes, each with a drop on liquid DOM on them.<BR>
<BR>
Not two minutes after we left the restroom, I was paranoid of being caught. I hadn't even eaten any yet. So me and my friend Chris were going to go to my house and drop the DOM off, take a hit each, and then go back to the mall. On the way to my house, we went to Wendy's. I had just been fired from there, and one of the guys there hated me. He ended up hitting me in the face at Wendy's. My first thought was to kick this guy's ass, but then I thought that the DOM would fly out of my pocket, because it was only wrapped in a paper towel. So I didn't want the cubes to break up. Then I thought of calling the police from Wendy's, but then reconsidered again. We left and called the police from my house and took care of it WITHOUT risking the DOM. This happened at about 7 pm.<BR>
<BR>
At about 9 pm, Chris and I got back from the police station after filling out the papers to press charges, and my brother Shawn and his friend Mark was there. Chris went home, and then my friend Trevor showed up. At 10 pm sharp, we each ingested one hit of DOM and 30 mg of Adderall, a type of amphetamine. I was used to starting to feel hallucinogens after about 45 minutes because the only ones I have ever done are LSD and DXM (at the time). After an hour, none of us felt anything except from the Adderall, so Shawn, Mark and I all took another hit of DOM.<BR>
<BR>
Mark had never done anything but smoke green, so this was one hell of an experience for him. I was happy for helping him trip his first time, and he was happy because he wanted to trip. But nothing was happening. So we turned the lights out, and started watching TV in the dark. <BR>
<BR>
That's when it hit us. <BR>
<BR>
First, Mark started mumbling something, and didn't shut up for what seemed like hours. He started saying that he could see tracers, and he wouldn't stop laughing. That got all four of us laughing for about a half and hour. I can't really be exact on any times after that because when you are on DOM, time slows down and speeds up so much, it's not worth trying to figure out. We all ingested another Adderall (30 mg again) and then I got up off the couch to turn on the light.<BR>
<BR>
When the light turned on, we all left reality. Colors covered the walls. Everything was surrounded with yellow borders, and those yellow borders were surrounded with an even thicker blue border. Everything looked like it was underwater, and I felt like I was seeing the world for the very first time. <BR>
<BR>
We pretty much sat around and tripped balls all night, until Trevor started having a bad trip. Trevor kept saying that the devil was talking to him and telling him to kill himself. So now we have 4 guys on DOM, one of them is suicidal, and we have to stop him from doing it. NOT EASY. He eventually puked after we fed him about 20 vitamin C pills (I heard it helps bad LSD trips so...) and about 2 gallons of old milk. He was a lot better after that, but it really pissed me off.<BR>
<BR>
Then I remember thinking that I had ingested way too much shit and that I was going to die. This was at about 5 am on Saturday. I didn't know that DOM was supposed to last this long, and I thought I should have been coming down my now. I was still peaking.<BR>
<BR>
I decided to take a shower to try to calm myself down. The water came out of the shower head in bursts of colors, and the water felt like a very soft touch whenever it touched me. <BR>
<BR>
I don't remember much from there, but what I do remember it that every tile in the bathroom was a different color, and the more I tried to realize how fucked up I was, the more fucked up I got.<BR>
<BR>
Mark told me I was in the bathroom for 20 minutes. I thought it had been four hours.<BR>
<BR>
I couldn't talk strait. I was hallucinating alot, and I loved it, but kept thinking that I would die. I wasn't tired at all, but I did love the closed-eye visuals. <BR>
<BR>
One thing that made this the ultimate trip was trying to bowl on Saturday morning. I am on a bowling league, and me and Shawn had to bowl. The only problem was the lanes looked like the yellow brick road from the Wizard of Oz, and they kept moving.<BR>
<BR>
I tried to play football after this, and there was no way that I could do it. The longer I concentrated on looking at the ball, the more distored my vision became. And this was at about 1 pm on Saturday. OVER 12 HOURS AFTER INGESTION!<BR>
<BR>
The trip started to die down after this, but didn't totally go away that night. I finally got to sleep at 11 pm, making the trip last over 24 hours, and when I woke up the next morning, I could still see tracers and colors out of the corner of my eyes.<BR>
<BR>
For those wanting to try DOM: Do not OD! DOM takes a while to get started, but it will kick your ass once it does. It's a great trip, as long as it's good, but Trevor had a really bad trip, and since then has gone strait-edge. Don't take any more than 2 hits at a time. And if you take it at all, have fun.<!--   End Body   -->

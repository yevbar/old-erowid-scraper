I woke up this Sat and decided it was time to try 2CI for real. Although I had 1 week earlier procured 1g from an online source I had only dabbled with about 5mg up until now. A friend was coming over for some beer, pot and Family Guy at 6pm, so decided I would clean the house.<br>
<br>
Ingested 12mg of 2CI at 11am and began cleaning. After about 45 mins I felt a huge rush of energy and I was off like a tornado; blitzing the kitchen, lounge, hall, bathroom and my bedroom by about 1:30pm. <br>
<br>
Felt really happy looking at the sparkling bathroom sink and realised that the 2CI was ramping it up. At this point I was starting to get the 'acid tingles' so I thought that some music would be a good idea; Something chilled but with a strong beat. I went for Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre and happily spent two hours in front of the PC smoking a joint or two and really, really getting into the music.<br>
<br>
3:30pm and things began to get difficult. I was having trouble rolling as my hands appeared strange to me and I had a case of the shakes. In hindsight this was due to me forgetting to put the heating on lol but under the 2CI I didnt recognise the sensation of cold at first. Rolling a joint, it was like I was using someone else hand, hard to explain but wierd!<br>
<br>
As I was running out of marlboros I decided to walk round to the corner shop, even though the thought of having to interact with people in my state was rather daunting. I left the house and walked round the corner to the shop. It was below 0 and the cold air felt really nice. Everything was covered in frost which leant a nice 'christmassy'<br>
feel to the area. However something about the fresh air started me tripping quite hard.<br>
As I stood in the queue in the shop (4pmish) I heard a loud vomiting noise. For a second I worried I had thrown up but a quick look down confirmed I hadnt. Wasn't sure though as trippy feeling was getting more intense. The world seemed much more intense and I now understand what people mean about the 'cartoony, visuals on 2CI. Definate clean lined, cartoony feel to the world.<br>
<br>
Got home with my smokes and watched telly, began to get rather anxious as trip felt like it could go either way. Realised my friend would be round in a couple of hours and that chilled me out somewhat. Spend rest of afternoon watching Joey and Friends which was good as it was nice familiar, gentle comedy. By 6pm I was very chilled, more stoned than 2CI but definately still some 2CI in there.  Chatted with friend, had a couple of beers and another joint, by 8pm I felt myself coming back to baseline, everything began to look normal and began to just feel stoned.<br>
<br>
Went to bed at 1:30am feeling tired and aching all over but happy. Slept till 11am. Woke up feeling good, very relaxed and refreshed.<br>
<br>
Overall I am really glad I didn't go straight to 20mg as that would have been way to much for me. 12 was just right and I think it would be excellent for a night out clubbing as it was a very energetic and trippy high and although I didnt get the loved up feeling some report I reckon I might've had I been out at a club.  Despite the short bad patch I really enjoyed this experience and am looking forward to experimenting 2CI further, perhaps on a night out next time.<!--   End Body   -->

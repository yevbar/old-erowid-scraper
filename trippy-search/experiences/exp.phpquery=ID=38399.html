A friend got ahold of 100MG of 5-MEO-DMT and wanted us to experience it together. We go way back, each giving the other our very first 'giunea pig' dose of 3 hits of LSD when fairly young. Our first hallucinogenic experiences quickly led to a mutual spiritual dialogue. We tried many many things while in other states, yoga, meditation, chakra work, etc. Anyway, when he got some 5-MEO-DMT, we both did ALOT of reading on the subject, as we always did...reading everything possible. So, when we tried it the first time, we had all sorts of controls in place...natural light from candles, phones off the hook, etc. And, we knew from our research, one of us needed to be completely normal for the other's experience. <BR>
<BR>
There were three of us in that darkened room, sitting around a large (5'wide X 8'high) chunk of unhewn/uncut rose quartz. We did a meditation (that he and I had learned through experience) to attune ourselves to the energy of that stone, the three of us sitting in a comfortable meditative stance on our knees, backs straight and grounded, in a triangle across from each other with the stone in the middle. After some time, I'd say 20 minutes or so, he leaned over and placed a pipe with lightly tamped ashes in it and roughly 15MG of 5-MEO DMT into my mouth. As he lit the lighter, I inhaled slowly, eyes closed and not knowing how much I was getting, or what I was in for. Instantly, before even blowing out the hit, the entire scene disappeared, and I was standing/floating/sitting (?) in front of something that resembled oils of different weights, all moving in every direction at the same time, and all in the dark red/brown spectrum of light. Realizing this 'oil' enveloped my entire periphery, a perfect circle of about 16-18', right in the center of my field of vision, pushed its way back about 2 feet, and extended the 'oils' onto a 3-dimensional backdrop. <BR>
<BR>
So here I am, sitting (?) in front of a canvas of dark red/brown oils with a background of the same oils in perfect three dimension...it seemed as though I could reach into the 'hole'. Then, the chunk of raw rose quartz appeared in the center of the circle. I studied it carefully, noticing every minute detail about it's appearance. It seemed to fill up from an unseen source with a liquid almost as thick as honey, but emitting light. When it was full of light, it began to pulse...not like a heartbeat, but more like a strobe. Slowly it pulsed, as I watched in the smallest detail, tiny (VERY tiny) strands of light wove their way through the rough inner surfaces of the stone, finding their way to the outer edge, and refracting off in a myriad of directions once at the unhewn surface. This was happening in the trillions. I had full tactile response as the light strands flooded my skin with awareness. I sat (?) there for about 15 minutes watching and experiencing this 'Raw Energy' flood over me. After that initial timeframe, it's almost like my mind's eye faded, but still very lucid...sounds were crisp, candle lights were bright and very defined, like coming down from LSD X10. <BR>
<BR>
Overall, this was an exceptional experience for me, as I have tried many times to perceive raw energy, and I believe that this experience did allow me to 'see' what I had yearned for. Now, for the Temporary Schizophrenia part: My friend and I tried 5-MEO-DMT several more times (I took it a total of 7 times) but none of the experiences were even vaguely similar to my first trip. Every other time I tried it, we had controled settings, although none of them were centered around a stone or idol, or whatever. I remember from the other experiences very little except the thought of 'You just fucking killed yourself!' and EXTREME discomfort, needing to utilize every bodily function that I had at the same time...and not being able to move or do anything about it. My friend helped me though by reminding me to breathe (seems that I 'forgot' to breathe, and would turn blueish alot) <BR>
<BR>
I do remember having one especially bad episode looking at a collector's plate with cats in Santa hats...I could not figure out what they were, and I couldn't get closer to it...there were distinct voices (along with the normal electrical-buzzing sound that accompanied 5-MEO-DMT trips) that were driving me insane! I could not make out what any 1 voice was saying, but there were many...like tuning into hundreds of radio stations at the same time. I felt completely unable to assimilate any of the information as it whizzed past me in this surreal hyperstate that I was in. It took me almost 2 years to get these voices out of my head. I went to Psychologists and they did tests, I was put on anti-anxiety/anti-depressives, I did meditations, everything I could think of to get back to normal. <BR>
<BR>
In retrospect, I would not have changed a thing, as I believe that 5-MEO-DMT caused me to have a complete ego-collapse...it nullified my complete belief system over and over again, and I was forced to create a new person out of those ashes. I am stronger spiritually and mentally now than I EVER have been, and would not be a successful businessman today had I not had the 5-MEO-DMT experiences. As a side note: None of these ill-effects ever happened to my friend, or any of the other people that took 5-MEO-DMT in my presence, although, we all did quit taking LSD and mushrooms about the same time... My analogy: the door of perception had banged against the wall too hard.<!--   End Body   -->

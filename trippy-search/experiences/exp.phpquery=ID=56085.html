Mon, 9/18/06, 3:15 AM at time of entry. Smoked at about 1:30.<br>
<br>
[Preparation:]<br>
My first time ever trying Salvia. Quiet, dimly-lit room, laying back and propped up on a futon with a pillow supporting my head. Will definitely do this laying down next time. Fan on low setting in the next room pointing in my direction. Smoked through a glass bowl instead of a bong. Dosage was also less than recommended, since I mainly just wanted to sample it for my first time. Because of that, no sitter. Went into it with a relaxed mindset of experimentation, and a natural curiosity of reality, whether reality is anything beyond just what we currently perceive.<br>
<br>
[Report:] <br>
Most certainly did not “break through” my first time. I did not expect to. However, I experienced several strange occurrences and feelings. Took one hit, held it in for 30 seconds, effects felt almost immediately after exhaling. First, my skin began to feel ‘prickly’, is the only way I can describe it. A very intense but not uncomfortable tingle all over my body. I then began to sweat profusely, particularly my legs and forehead. I began to feel the “pulling” sensation that I’ve read is a common effect. <br>
<br>
At this point, it slowly dawned on me exactly what was pulling at me though, I closed my eyes and felt the tugging coming from my right. At this point - and this is difficult to explain in words - I was convinced that I was becoming part of a crudely-drawn or painted cartoon street sign, like the Sesame Street logo for example. I was slowly being absorbed into it, being slowly covered in paint, and I somehow knew that this pulling force, which may have been cartoon children, though I didn't actually see anyone, was trying to pull me into their cartoon land. Possibly by a ride on a school bus. Strange as it sounds, I thought my experience had something to do with the Children’s Television Workshop. As I had this sensation of being turned into a cartoon sign, certain parts of my body felt like I was being immersed in it, and that if it reached up past my neck, I would somehow “drown” in the sign or at least become part of it. The pulling later came from below me, and finally to my left. <br>
<br>
I was lucid the whole time however, still aware of my surroundings but also aware of this odd sensation I was going through at the same time. Sometime during the prickly/sweaty feeling my pants became very uncomfortable and I had to take them off. Unfortunately the fan suddenly made me cold, which I think might have slowly grounded me back into reality. Things I said included me trying to convince this force to “take me with you”, asking “where are you going?”, and various odd phrases and syllables about being immersed in a street sign. As the feeling subsided, I felt that I missed the bus to cartoon land. Following this, the feeling left me, and the only remaining symptom was a heavy feeling in my head. Still felt low coming-down effects nearly an hour later. By 3:00 the feeling was mostly gone.<br>
<br>
[Analysis:]<br>
I reiterate that I was lucid, I knew what was going on, these were just the things that came up in my mind at the time, and I attributed these seemingly random ideas to the sensation I was feeling. Perhaps the childlike nature of the feeling was due to this being a new experience, along with the drug-culture cliché of being taken away in a “magic bus” so to speak. I had very few preconceptions about the substance and have heard every trip is different, so I didn’t know what to expect. <br>
<br>
[Conclusion:] <br>
I plan to do this again at proper dosage and a higher temperature flame, but not without a ‘sitter’. Very interested in breaking through and I believe that I am capable of doing so, based on this first try being a lower dosage and still nearly altering my perception of reality.<!--   End Body   -->

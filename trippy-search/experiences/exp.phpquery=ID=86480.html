<!--   Start Body   -->


Since 1974 until today, moderate experiences with Cannabis, Coke, LSD, Lysergic Acid out of Seeds of Ipomea Purpurea, Ether, Amphetamine, Atropine, N2O, MDMA, BZP, GHB, Butyrolactone, DOM, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, Psylobcibine, Ephedrine and actually new Methylone, Butylone, Mephedrone, 2C-C, 2C-D and MDPV.<br>
<br>
Following information in the web, starting MDPV with 5mg snorted. First times too short and not buzzing euphoria (like methylphenidate, merely sharpened concentration) against longer lasting aches, cramps and uneasy feelings in body, to the point that I decided the material was of no use for anything in my life.<br>
<br>
Then I found a RC-Shop in my own country, which was unusual and very welcome, as seizing by customs of orders sent from certain countries increase up here, and as a socially integrated middle-class person and responsible father of two minors, trouble with prosecutors is off-limits.<br>
<br>
The material here was more expensive than from my first source, but seemed to be  as pure as the shop suggested on its website. Also there was a difference in color, consistency and taste. Not yellowish but pure white, not grainy and quite easy to refine with razorblade but fluffy like flour and flocking, not with that potato-like earthy smell and taste but strongly chemical.<br>
<br>
No aches and unease, as far as I did not exceed the 15mg per day. And the most remarkable effect of all was, that my metabolism seemed to be changed in order to burn all useless fat deposits which I had accumulated since 1983, when for the last time my weight had come down to 74 kgs at the age of 24. In barely one month I had lost 6 to 7 kgs without any suffering, without yoyo effect, without making me feel low-key at any time. <br>
<br>
Far from it! I am feeling great, I am pleased to feel every fiber of my body and to see the constantly trained muscles twice a week over the last 11 years in the mirror, which until May had always remained hidden under a slightly too fatty skin. <br>
<br>
Having started the experience accidentally with reading another chapter in a book (which I had started reading in 2007 but left after the first 20 pages) dealing by strange coincidence with loosing weight by visualizing and especially feeling the body shaped already as one wants to have it, the theme of the following chapter, training oneself to feel gratitude in every moment of one's life began to work also. <br>
<br>
Pure magic, a fundamental and unexpected change in my life, similar to the one MDMA had caused in the first years after I had the luck of knowing and applying that material in 1995. But yet, it is a dangerous material if one does not bring up the required respect for it. It is not like Alcohol or Cannabis, just another tool for parties (MDMA should neither be misused that way). <br>
<br>
Just remember Paracelsus, not only regarding one MDPV-Session but the whole period you use the material. He had already reached the state of mind which in our days and in the System we live in nobody teaches anymore to be a worthwhile goal.<!--   End Body   -->

<!--   Start Body   -->


First of all, I've taken pills before and have had some of the best experiences of my life while high on e. The bad trip I experienced in this case was purely due to my own carelessness, and it's taught me to be much more careful in the future.<br>
<br>
While out with some friends we decided to get some pills for a certain DJ set we'd been looking forward to. Each of us had 3 pills to take over the course of the evening.<br>
<br>
I took one half an hour before the set started, and began to come up about the right time. Soon after (not sure how soon, time was all over the place), a friend told me he'd already taken his other pills. Whether or not it was because I was high, or because I was just stupid, I took the next two at once while I was still way, way up from the first. I didn't stop to think that his tolerance was far higher than mine.<br>
<br>
I first started getting concerned when I noticed trails. I'd never had trails before so I realised this was the highest I'd ever been. But I was still going up. At one point there were strobes and I remember thinking I was standing still, looking at them, but a  quick glance at my body revealed that it was moving, completely independent of me. That old cliche of the music moving 'through' someone, I now understand completely what it means. It was as if the music was waves on the sea and my body was a boat bobbing up and down. It was 100% out of my control, dictated by the beats which I was feeling had become a part of me.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the set ended (a 2 hour set, went by in what I remember as about 15 minutes). I turned around to leave as I was starting to panic about the fact that we didn't have any water (the nearest free water was a 15 minute walk away at the best of times). To my unbridled horror, all I could see in front of me was an endless crowd and I couldn't get out.<br>
<br>
I started feel sick and my eyes were rolling into my head uncontrollably. I felt that if I left them up there for too long or closed my eyes for longer than a second, I would surely lose consciousness, possibly even die. Whether or not this was true, or a product of the drug, I have no idea. My friends seemed concerned about me (some of them were sober) but I was unable to open my mouth and express my concern due to the intense lockjaw.<br>
<br>
I felt someone's hand grab mine and we struggled through the crowd for what felt like hours. The whole time I felt as if I was going to die. Suddenly we broke out of the crowd and I felt as if I could breathe for the first time. I felt a rush of happiness and gratitude towards my friend who had helped me out. My nausea disappeared and my eyes stopped rolling so much (oddly the eye-rolling was the worst thing about this whole experience). I was still extremely thirsty but I knew I could get water in time now.<br>
<br>
The rest of the trip was quite pleasant, though some odd things happened which lead me to believe the pills were cut with some kind of hallucinogen. For example, when I closed my eyes, I found myself still able to see everything around me quite clearly, though when I opened them again, it was obvious that the image hadn't been real. Also when I shut my eyes I was able to call up friends' faces in black and white, when I heard them speak their faces shot up to look at me, though their mouths didn't move.<br>
<br>
In the future I will never EVER take pills unless I am near a good supply of water. And if I do take them I'll be sure to bring a watch so I can time how long it's been. I've never been so scared in my entire life!<!--   End Body   -->

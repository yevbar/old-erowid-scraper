<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: 16 lines of methamphetamine in an eight hour period, if standard size, is considered an extremely high dose, see methamphetamine Dose Chart]</FONT> <br>
<br>
Yesterday was the fourth day of my spring break. I hadn't done any drugs for a few weeks because I was applying for a job and they were going to drug test me. My parents were out of town and I had the house to myself, so of course, I planned to get as fucked up as possible immediately after my drug test. Waiting for me at my house was my girlfriend, we'll call her T, my friend, we'll call him N, and thirty dollars worth of crystal meth that we had spent the last few hours cutting up. <br>
<br>
So it's about 2:15 in the afternoon and I'm back from my drug test and ready to do massive amounts of crystal meth. Of course, none of us have ever done meth before. We've done cocaine, but that's about as close as we've ever gotten. Conveniently, we have a little bit of coke left over from a few weeks ago, but that'll come into play later. I'm already up as hell on caffeine from 2 sodas when we start doing lines. By the time we got everything ready it was about 3:00. T did the first line, and immediately she was complaining about how much it hurt her nose compared to coke. I went next. As soon as I snorted it I felt a terrible burn circling around the inside of my nostril. It literally felt like my nose was being cleaned out with barbed wire, but it only lasted for around thirty seconds. Then N did a line, and so on.<br>
<br>
I started feeling it first, and I have to say, it was genius. I never really loved cocaine because I'm always so up anyway that it doesn't do much for me. But this, this was amazing. Not only did I feel up, but I felt more comfortable in my surroundings than I ever have before. I was talking fast as hell and my heartbeat was a little too hard for my liking, but other than that, it was perfect. There was a euphoria I felt that coke hadn't even gotten me close to. T and N weren't feeling anything close to what I was. I told them it must be the caffeine, so they decided to do more. And when they did more, I did more.<br>
<br>
The main problem was, we weren't treating it like meth, we were treating it like cocaine. The only difference we really knew of between coke and meth is that meth can take 5 - 10 minutes to hit you, while coke hits you almost immediately, and that meth lasts longer. So we would do a few lines each, wait ten to fifteen minutes to make sure it fully kicked in, and if we thought it wasn't enough, we'd do a few more lines.  What made it worse was that all three of us had colds and stuffed up noses. I had a sinus infection that I've had for months, so every time I did a line I would first have to put my head over some boiling water, and then blow my nose. This was only a minor setback, and I didn't mind much because I was feeling fucking fantastic. <br>
<br>
I was already loudly declaring meth as my new favorite drug. T and N were having a good time too, but not as good as me. So we all kept doing more and more every 15 minutes. This lasted until 6:40 when we all decided we were good and that we shouldn't do anymore until we started coming down. By this time we had all done more or less eight lines. Then came the cause of our downfall. The moment when we all decided that we'd had enough was also the moment that we came up with the plan for the rest of then night. Never, ever, make a plan while at the peak of a crystal meth high, especially when it deals with unfamiliar and potentially dangerous drugs, it's just not a good idea. <br>
<br>
The plan was to wait until 8:40 before we did any more meth. Then we would do a few lines to keep us up for a few more hours until around 10:30pm. I have no idea how we came up with these specific times, but I'm sure it seemed like a great idea when we did. We figured out that if we did another session at 10:30 then that would use up all of our meth. But then our truly great idea set in. First of all, we knew N needed to be home at 12:00, so after the 10:30 session it was just me and T. We decided that we wanted to stay up longer, but we didn't have enough meth, so our plan was that once we started coming down from the meth we were going to do a few lines of coke. Then, once we started coming down from the coke, we'd smoke the little weed we had left, and BAM!! We'd get to sleep sometime around 1:00 in the morning. Or so we thought.<br>
<br>
It didn't exactly go as planned. We had done our 3:00 - 6:40 session and our 8:40 session. When 10:30 came around T made four lines for each of us. I did my normal sniffing steam routine, only this time when I blew my nose, blood came out. That got us a little nervous, but I assured them I could do my last four lines. These ones hurt just a little bit more. By the time we finished the 10:30 session we'd all done around 16 lines each. That was all over the span of seven and a half hours, and let me tell you, that was the shortest seven and a half hours I've ever lived through. Time became a slide show of five minute intervals.<br>
<br>
We mostly just watched movies and listened to the occasional CD, but I honestly remember about ten minutes of each movie, not just because our memory was destroyed by the meth, but also because we weren't paying any attention. Most of the time we just talked at 500 miles per hour, although every once and a while we'd walk around the block and smoke a cigarette. Every cigarette I smoked made me come down a little, so I don't know why I smoked three, but I really just felt the need to go do something, and that was something to go do. <br>
<br>
The hours of 11:00 - 4:20 are pretty much a blur to me. After N left, T and I walked around my house for a few hours cleaning up and watching movies. Once we started coming down, we were quite confused. It was like no crash we'd ever felt. It wasn't as much of a crash as a violent jiggle. Our heads started to feel like they were swelling up and we felt tingly all over, like all our limbs were asleep. We thought it would be over in thirty minutes or so, but it lasted from about 2:00 - 4:00 in the morning. Then we assumed our crash was coming to an end, and it was time to do a few coke lines. What we didn't realize was that coming down from crystal meth sometimes takes a little longer than that.<br>
<br>
We thought that the crash would end while we were in the midst of our coke high, and then once we came down from that we could smoke a little pot and go right to sleep. Well, to make a long story short, T and I each did two lines of coke at 4:20, and they felt really good at first. Then T and I began reacting to the meth-coke combination very differently. She suddenly seemed like she was a robot, completely stiff and brain-dead, while I became more up than I've ever been on coke.<br>
<br>
We decided that it would do us both a lot of good to smoke a little weed to bring me up and bring her back. We smoked a bowl each and immediately felt like shit. We got into my bed at 5:00 and layed there shaking, twitching, and most importantly, completely awake until 8:30. The entire time I was breathing irregularly and my heartbeat was jumping out of my chest. Every once and a while I would breathe in through our nose and get another meth drip. We decided there was no way we were going to fall asleep any time soon. <br>
<br>
After a few minutes of figuring out what was going on, T drove to her house to take a quick shower while I stayed home. I couldn't figure out what to do, so I went onto my computer. I still felt pretty strange. My eyes had huge bags under them and I looked tired as hell, but I was completely awake. My heartbeat had gone down a little, and my shakes and twitches were almost completely gone. I was getting a little dizzy though, and I was afraid that if I sniffed at all I might get another drip that would send me right back to where I was before. My mouth was also really dry, so I decided to get something to drink. I grabbed an Arizona Iced Tea, and brought it to my computer with me. I knew it had caffeine in it, but I decided it just take a tiny sip to make my mouth feel better. Well, about ten seconds after I took that sip my body went insane.<br>
<br>
First my hands and feet all felt really fuzzy again and I got a huge head-rush. I started to have a panic attack, and it felt like the walls were closing in on me. My heartbeat was faster and harder than it had been all night. I looked down at my chest and I could see it moving up and down with the beat of my heart. I could barely breath, and in an instant I had fallen off of my chair onto the ground. I didn't know what to do, so I got up as fast as I could and started thinking about how to slow down my heartbeat. I started taking long, slow breaths and walking around my house. <br>
<br>
This is the first time I've ever felt like I was overdosing, and it didn't make any sense to me. The only explanation I could think of was that the tiny sip of caffeine triggered my blood to start flowing faster again and it fucked me up. Whatever it was, I was freaking the fuck out. Finally I called a guy I knew who I knew did meth. He told me to smoke some cigarettes. So I did, and I felt a little better. I had one more small panic attack, but as soon as T came back over I started to calm down. <br>
<br>
The rest of the day up until now has been pretty normal, except for the fact that we still can't sleep, and we have felt like complete shit all day. I talked to N on the phone and apparently as soon as he got home he laid down on his bed staring at the ceiling. He did that for eight and a half hours, until he too gave up on sleep. T and I have spent almost the entire day lying down trying to sleep, with no success. It's now 7:37 p.m. and both T and I feel like absolute shit. It's been 28 hours and 37 minutes since we did our first meth lines. I've now been awake for a little over 35 hours straight. It's been 28 hours and 37 minutes since we started doing meth, and 15 hours and 17 minutes since we stopped. And to answer your question: Yes, it was worth it.<!--   End Body   -->

First let me start with describing the wormwood extract.  I bought about 2 oz of fresh wormwood leaves from an online supplier.  I dried all the leaves under shade and then ground them into powder or very small chunks.  I then filled the jar about halfway with them and then filled the jar with acetone completely.  With the cover on the jar, I shook the jar while watching TV for about half an hour.  The acetone, a very murky green at this point, was then strained through a coffee filter and left to dry on top of a hot plate for about 12 hours until it left a hash-like substance on the bottom of the jar, like described in a report I'd read.  It was a very thin layer, somewhat sticky, and I rolled it up into balls. <br>
<br>
I then loaded up a very large glass-blown 'tobacco' pipe with weighed 0.75 of the wormwood extract and 0.2g of the salvia extract.  I'm somewhat familiar with each substance so I knew how to recognize the effects of both.<br>
<br>
I found that the wormwood extract made the salvia significantly easier to smoke, compared to the normally harsh hits I must take to trip off salvia.  After holding about 3 hits in as long as I could, I put down the bowl and laid down with all the lights off and closed my eyes.<br>
<br>
The salvia hit me very fast.  I lost most of the perception of who I was and then experienced a whole new plain.  I was walking through a forest of completely black and white, with deer ducking in and out of the trees.  However, unlike other normal salvia trips, I was completely aware that this wasn't real.  I also felt as if this new world was very clean, and the trees were almost texture-less, with brilliant, contrasted white and black outlines similar to birch trees.  The deer frankly scared me, I was sprinting through the forest while feeling their prying eyes on me.  I suddenly saw a vision of a friend of mine, he was telling me 'Wake up, wake up.'.  The deer began to laugh and the sound surrounded me.  I then felt this world sucking back and, although I had not initially realized that it was gone, the realization of the true world was quickly coming back to me.  I opened my eyes and was laying in my bed.<br>
<br>
At this point, I was feeling some of the aftermath of the salvia along with the odd effects of thujone.  Many times after I use salvia, my scalp and my feet feel almost raw.  My reality was shifting in and out of perspective like I was in an Escher-esque world, the dimensions of time and space felt almost meaningless.  At this point, however, I could consciously attribute these happenings to the psychoactives.  I sat down and watched a 'Recess' marathon for the next 2 hours or so, and the effects of thujone wore off.  I was feeling very inspired, however, during the comedown, and I made two very interesting acrylic paintings. <br>
<br>
These two psychoactives are quite fun seperately, but together, they slightly detract from each other.  However, it is not enough to discredit the experience, as it is something I would definitely try again.<!--   End Body   -->

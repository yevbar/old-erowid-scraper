Ok, so after NOT getting the mushrooms my friend and I wanted so badly, we were looking for another way to fuck up our bodies, so we did what any delinquent American would do - we got on the internet. We saw nutmeg on a list of hallucinogens and said, 'what the hell.' Big mistake.<BR>
<BR>
Between the two of us we finished an entire bottle. For the first four hours I felt nothing but mildly drunk, then shit started to get weird. I had no perception of time and my very short-term memory was fried. I vaguely recall going from house to house with my friend, aimlessly. I played video games at my friend's house for awhile, but I didn't even have the attention span for that. I felt incredibly stupid, but I did not care. I didn't care about anything.<BR>
<BR>
At one point in the night I actually thought I was going to die of heart failure, because it was pounding out of my chest. Somehow, I ended up at my girlfriend's house in the middle of her family barbecue. It was at this point (6 hours after ingestion) that I began to get worried. It was not wearing off, but the strange sensation of detachment from reality was growing. I told her what was going on and she helped me into her basement where it was dark. I was hearing voices and other strange sounds that seemed just out of my realm of comprehension. It intensified exponentially and I knew at this point I was having a 'bad trip.'<BR>
<BR>
I was lying down on her couch and I kept hearing bizarre sounds above my head and my body was beginning to twitch. It was like sensory overload; I felt like my body couldn't take it anymore and I would just explode. It was at this point that I thought I was going to die, but I didn't care. I was getting visual hallucinations out of my peripheral vision that left me feeling very vulnerable and helpless. I had my girlfriend take me outside where I preceeded to puke my guts out in front of all my friends. If I was in a distance puking contest I would have won. I had never thrown up before but I have seen other people do it, and what I did was completely different. The puke must have shot out of my body at mach 5 and I proceeded to have dry heaves for another half hour.<BR>
<BR>
Things still weren't getting better, I was feeling more and more detached from reality. Let me try and explain. My vision told me that the floor was flat, but my mind interpreted it as completely contorted. You can imagine what this conflict between my eyes and mind did to my motor skills. Somehow, I got to a bed in her house and fell asleep. When I woke up I was still far from OK. The same detachment, but without the visuals (thank GOD!!!). I lay in a nutmeg stupor, if you will, for the entire day while my girlfriend took care of me (awww, how sweet). I had the WORST drymouth I had ever experienced and my breath reeked of nutmeg for weeks, no joke. I finally felt normal the next day.<!--   End Body   -->

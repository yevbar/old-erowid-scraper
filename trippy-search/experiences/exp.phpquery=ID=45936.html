<br>
At around 6:30 pm in a car I decided to take down the tea mixture as fast as I could swallow the nasty warm mix.  I got to my friends apartment at 6:55pm and bought 3.5g of the mushrooms and made sure it was the precise weight let them moisten up in a glass of water with a crushed up vitamin c pill.  Moments after I finished those squishy mushrooms I could tell my pupils were larger than normal.  At 7:20 I started feeling the beginning effects; deep breathing, hearing, visual etc.  Then 7:30 came and patterns started forming like the last time I tripped on mushrooms, I was yawning constantly so much that my eyes would tear, and couldn't move from a couch, someone passed me a bowl and I stared at it for a while not realizing what it was and things started to break apart from my world as I knew it.<br>
<br>
I went outside to walk around and had a hard time walking down the apartment stairs.  I looked around a suburban area and started walking down the road with my friend, the way she appeared to me was disturbing like she was urging to leave or something.  I put my headphones in my ear and started listening to trippy music I decided to bring it with me and walked back to the apartment.  I sat down and closed my eyes and saw too many patterns and colors for me to describe here, but they were moving and changing and morphing. I couldnt keep them closed any more it was too hard to deal. <br>
<br>
Around 8:15 me and my 3 friends 1 of whom was tripping decided to do something. This is where it got to confusing for me to understand because I thought I had already been outside and seen cop cars but then I went outside again and actually saw cop cars staking out in the area and ran back into the apartment and warned my friends, they told me to forget about it act calm and walk in the car but It took me a long time to do this and I looked like a 3 year old crack head.<br>
<br>
We all drove around for about 20 mins and the whole time I listened to my headphones and watched the lights outside and thught we were going so fast that maybe I was just seeing things and we weren't moving so I opened the door and realized we were moving and I almost died. We finally stopped and my friends decided to go swing on a rope swing, I only knew this because while I was trying to find out where I was and who I was by calling people on my cell phone I kept hearing voices repeated over and over in my head along with the music I was listening to. I would close my eyes and couldnt handle it and things started moving to fast for my body I felt sick and had a headache and more sounds in my ears.<br>
<br>
I was so confused about anything going on that I sat down and tryed to figure out what the world meant to me.  Finally what felt like hours later probably minutes though we got back in the car and went back to the apartment and sat down.  I watched tv and I saw a show and told everyone I had already seen it and they told me that it was a brand knew showing and there is no way I could have but for some reason I explained what happened in the show and some of the things I said actually happened which freaked my friends out.  I would look at the floor and patterns started swirling around my feet sucking my feet into the floor I thought and I fell back into the couch and rested for a bit, I could feel my trip fading away so I decided to go back to my town and go home.<br>
<br>
We were in the car and I felt fine until boom a second wave of trip came back harder than anything I ever witnessed in my life.  I asked my friends if I had died and they told me I didnt but I refused to belive them and I was convinced I drove a car and crashed it and died even though I wasn't driving. I saw so many things in my head I didn't know what happened and what I was just seeing or dreaming.  Then I thought I was supposed to be reincarnated and that I couldn't die because I was dead already.<br>
<br>
I started telling the people in the car that they knew what I needed, I needed to create peace and solve all the worlds problems, I was to become reincarnated into a god on earth to bring complete nirvana to the world and make everyone equal.  We got to a 7 11 and the first thing I saw was a cop car and I thought I needed to talk to him because he could help me reincarnate into a god or something. Instead I went into the store and ripped off my neclace and said this is no importance to me and that everything is fake and ripped off my shirt and tryed explaining what I thought I needed to do to have gods powers and fix the world.<br>
<br>
Before I knew what was going on I was on the ground with a cop commanding me and telling me what to do and I didn't understand because I thought I was more important than anyone in the world at this point.  People started coming to the 7 11 and I was trying to explain that this was how it started with people and that there was a center to this power and I needed to find it.  I told them that my name was tip of the finger and I was Michael Angelo. Next thing I could remember after this was being in a brawl with 4 police officers.  Apparently I was told that they couldnt control me and they had to shakel my legs and handcuff me but I twisted the handcuffs so hard I broke the nerves in my left hand.<br>
<br>
I thought I saw all the important people in my life like my boss/chef, parents, my cousins, 6 of my closest friends and they were all happy for me because while I was being strapped to the stretcher I thought the ambulance was meant for my reincarnation to god.  When the people in the ambulance were talking to me I must have thought they were asking me questions in order to change into god and I told them everything they wanted to hear and keep feeling closer and closer then I looked in the window in the back of the ambulance and saw my face a body changing into the 4 people I admire most in my life my chef, my dad, my cousin and one of my friends a freaky lookin person I must say.<br>
<br>
Then as I entered the icu I was changing and all those important people sorrounded me in a circle and they told me that all I needed was one more element to be complete and I told them I knew what it was and that it was love so I looked to my right while being operated on and it was a nice old lady nurse I guess but I stared at her up and down and she morphed slowly into a girl I know very well and wanted a relationship with and she jumped on top of me, her head started coming towards mine and then I started seing a white light that had a rainbow tint in it that was vibrating and that was it.<br>
<br>
I woke up in the hospital and I have been changed positively ever since.  Now I can sense peoples horas feelings and I sense negative vibes and have a feeling in my stomach that I know before something really bad is about to happen.  I have been changed in many ways mentally and rarely I can see things before they happen.  But none of my friends believe me besides the ones that have witnessed that night.<!--   End Body   -->

<!--   Start Body   -->


I found two large bottles of hydrocodone/acetaminophen 7.5/750 and a small bottle of codeine/acetaminophen 30/300 tablets in my parents' medicine cabinet (why they have so many painkillers of that strength I don't know...) and decided to grab 4 of the hydrocodone and 3 of the  codeine.  I had used hydrocodone twice before, in conjunction with weed both times, and I had used codeine once by itself.<BR>
<BR>
I was pretty bored last night so I decided to take all of the pills, minus one of the hydrocodone (since I didn't want to have too intense of an experience).  Since I was home by myself, I thought it would be a good opportunity to take some notes on my experience and write up an account of it.  I closed the door to my room, turned on one fairly dim light, and started playing The Doors softly.  Starting at 11:25, I took one of each pill every 5 minutes.  At about 11:35, after taking two of each, my body started to feel nicely warm and tingly, I could feel the stuff coursing through my veins.  A great feeling.<BR>
<BR>
Ten minutes later I could definitely feel the effects setting in; I saw a few small color spots.  I started to really get into the music, it sounded very melodic and nice.  I wanted to dance but I felt very relaxed just sitting in my chair, my whole body fealt really really good.  Everything around me seemed new and alien in a way, and my hands looked like they really shouldn't have been part of my body.  I started to forget that I had done things right after doing them, like I would type a sentence and then have no idea how it got there.  This worked the other way too...I would be sure I had done a certain thing but then realize I actually hadn't.  At 11:58 I started to get fidgety and realised I had to pee again even though I had just done so...:-/<BR>
<BR>
I went downstairs to the bathroom and found I was VERY afraid of the dark so I rushed there and back as fast as I could.  I was most afraid that some person was hiding in my house and that they would jump out at me as I went by...I don't usually have that kind of fear at all.  The last time I took hydrocodone I had had some minor CEVs (that time I took 37.5 mg) so I decided to go lie down and close my eyes to see if I saw anything.  This turned out to be hard though, for some reason I could not keep my eyes closed, like my eyelids weren't working very well so I got back up.  At that time, 12:05, heights of objects started to be a little distorted.  The door looked very short, like I wouldn't be able to get through it without bending over quite a bit.<BR>
<BR>
I decided to try lying down and closing my eyes again and as I walked from my computer chair to the bed, I noticed that the room seemed to be rotating slowly counter-clockwise.  This was turning out to be not quite as spectacular as my last hydrocodone experience, so I decided to get back up and take the 4th hydrocodone pill at 12:16.  About 7 minutes later, I definitely fealt the 4th pill kicking in and I was pretty fucked up.  I fealt kinda drunk; I was having trouble walking straight and everything seemed to be moving.  Every time I would take a step I would get all disoriented and everything would spin around and I'd have to wait for it to stop before taking another step.  I started to feel a tiny bit of nausea so I went to lie down again.<BR>
<BR>
This time when I closed my eyes I saw a gold, fuzzy background that seemed to be made up of a whole lot of little twinkling points all right next to each other.  Against that background I began to see black shapes much resembling hands appearing and disappearing all over it.  I got back up, it was 12:32, and sat back down at my computer (I was taking notes the whole time, and also talking to people online).  I was having quite a bit of trouble typing, the computer would bounce up and down.  I didn't feel nauseous at all which I was very happy about, but my whole body was quite itchy.  At 12:40 I decided to draw some pictures with colored pencils and that was very entertaining, even though my drawings sucked..lol.  Actually I drew one kinda cool picture of a boy that I named 'Hamburger Boy w/ Bacon + Eggs' (?).  I drew for about 10 minutes, then some pretty severe nausea started coming on so I decided to go lie down again which I had found to be a great way to get rid of most of hydrocodone's side effects in the past.<BR>
<BR>
While I had my eyes closed, I had a vision of a black mass writhing around until it took the shape of the grim reaper, who turned and walked towards me, scythe and all.  He got right up in my face and said in a raspy voice, 'two thousand and two'...kinda odd.  My body still fealt really good, I could feel my heartbeat all throughout my body...pretty wierd, but cool.  I decided to turn the music off for a while, but I could still hear it somehow which I found quite disconcerting so I turned it back on.  At 1:09 I went back to talking to people online.  I was having a pretty hard time not only typing but also reading, I was reading a lot of words differently than what they really were.  I was shaking pretty hard too.  At 1:20 I started to feel really nauseous and I decided that I should go down to the bathroom in case I puked.<BR>
<BR>
I did end up puking after a few dry heaves, which made me feel much better and also sobered me up a little bit.  As I left the bathroom, I scared my self half to death by looking in the mirror, my face was totally gray and for a minute I thought I was dying.  I went back to my room, shaking like crazy.  I was having some   mild hallucinations of mist in the periphery of my vision.  I got back to my room and decided to lie down to calm myself a bit.  When I closed my eyes I saw a rock that may have been a tombstone that had the number 2002 carved in it.  I was starting to get pretty freaked out by the 2002 thing, and the trip started to go quite a bit downhill.<BR>
<BR>
I sat down at my computer feeling very wide awake and talkative all of a sudden.  At 1:37 I fealt like I was coming down some, I started to look at the drawings I had done earlier and seeing how wierd they were...  I was still plenty fucked up though, I had the feeling that I was rotating forward slowly, or that the rest of the world was rotating backwards.  I amused myself for another 20 minutes or so by playing some virtual pool (which I really sucked at, I couldn't aim for crap, lol).  I was getting pretty bored and ready for the experience to end, so I decided to go to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
One last wierd thing happened before I got into bed though...I had my eyes closed for a few seconds and when I opened them again, my whole field of vision was upside down for less than a second, then it flipped right side up, VERY wierd..  The music still sounded really good to me (it was the same The Doors CD that I had on to begin with, it was on repeat) and part of me wanted to just stay up all night and listen to that CD, but I went to bed anyway at 2:03.  I slept way longer than I usually do, about 13 hours before my mom woke me up which was quite odd because I had gotten 12 hours of sleep the night before...  Overall this was a very enjoyable experience (except for about the last half hour), I will try this combination again.<BR>
<BR>
The side effects were't bad at all if you don't mind puking, which I don't...however I think I took a little bit too much; I would have liked a little less intense or shorter experience.<!--   End Body   -->

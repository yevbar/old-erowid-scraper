<!--   Start Body   -->


I'm writing this during the full effect of the pills. The pills were taken at about 8 am. I was not on any prescribed medication and had not taken psychedelics or narcotics for over a month. This experience took place at a school, and in a moderately dark room later on. No preperations were made beforehand. A small breakfast was consumed about 45 minutes prior to taking the pills.<br>
<br>
T+0: Took 3 50mg Concerta orally before midterms, just for the high, it doesn't help me concentrate very much.<br>
<br>
T+0:20: The tingling throughout my entire body started, and I lost feelings of hunger and thirst. My body broke out into what seemed like a cold sweat.<br>
<br>
T+0:45: Chorus class, my ability to reach high and low notes was significantly improved. I felt like I am contributing to the overall sound of the chorus and singing great. I felt more outgoing than I usually do in chorus, and really happy to be there enjoying the music.<br>
<br>
T+1:30: Starting a break before a midterm. I walked around the halls with a group of friends, one of which had taken the same dose of Concerta as I; he was totally fucked up. Anyways, most of us wandered into the lockerroom where I went to the bathroom, which was an awesome feeling combined with great happiness. We started back to our classrooms for the next tests.<br>
<br>
T+2:00: The break is over, and I noticed that I couldn't feel my legs walking up the stairs. I had a lot of energy and I was feeling well prepared for the test. The bell rang and everyone sat down and started.<br>
<br>
T+2:05: I rushed through the first part of the exam, confident in my work. I had slightly elevated concentration, and at that point I experienced unmeasurable happiness that I was doing a good job. I wanted to talk to people and tell them what I was feeling, which I am very cautious about on any normal day. I'm glad I kept my mouth shut!<br>
<br>
T+2:15: Finished the first part of the test, next was essays. I got up and 'flew' over to the teacher's desk to get the prompts.<br>
<br>
T+3:25: I completed the essays at this time. I had a mild writer's cramp in my arm, wrist, and hand, but it disappeared quickly when I lost almost all feeling in my body. My body was sweating coldly again, and my body was vibrating. I was very ready to get home, and looked forward to talking with friends on the stairs... specifically that. 'Flew' down the stairs.<br>
<br>
T+3:30: I saw my ride home, and *glided* over to the car. I talked my ride's ear off on the way home, about what I now realize were repetitive comments and a bit farout. I would describe the feeling of motion as a ride on a hovercraft =D.<br>
<br>
T+3:45: I arrived at home and rushed upstairs, where I'm sitting writing this. I practically inhaled a clementine, a granola bar, and a cheesestick and cranked some Grateful Dead and chilled out on the computer.<br>
<br>
T+4:37: I have no appetite whatsoever right now. The back of my throat and my mouth is tense and very dry, and I feel like I have the cottonmouth one might have after tokin' a quarter ounce of reefer: fucking INTENSE. My mouth tastes very sour. My heart is racing, and sometimes crawling. If I turn a light on my pupils dialate faster than I believe I have ever experienced, but I wouldn't remember. I feel like my head is off in space, and I would love to sleep but I have way way too much energy to even lay down. My body is rhythmically moving almost uncontrollably with the music. I feel intense pressure on my chest, and my thoughts are coming and going quickly.. it's a bit hard to concentrate on one thing only. A friend described what I am feeling as 'like a half dose of crack cocaine.' Haven't tried it myself.  Lastly, my body is shivering even though the heat is way up, and my muscles are unwillingly having spasms.<br>
<br>
T+4:57: That's my common experience with the drug. I just totally let myself go writing that last part, that was just about everything about the effects that came to mind... Pardon the length. From my other experiences with Concerta, at about 2 hours from now I feel very depressed and isolated from everyone.<br>
<br>
I would NOT reccomend this drug to anyone who is going through struggles in their life, or having emotional lows. I have taken this on great, great days and still felt like dying later in the day, I wouldn't want to hear about anyone commiting suicide. However, poppin these for me is.. 'fun?' on any good day, but in very careful moderation. It is way too easy for me to get addicted to this. I am very careful and that's my advice. <br>
<br>
Be safe and have a hell of a good time...<!--   End Body   -->

I bought a San Pedro cactus at the local cacti store about a year ago & have been growing it out back.  I finally got around to trying it.  I read up on all the extractions, etc. on Erowid & decided to go with cactus juice.  My logic was that cooking it or drying it has got to reduce the alkaloids at least a little - you always lose something in processing.  At the same time I couldn't imagine choking down nearly 2 feet of cactus raw.  Finally, I figured I could juice some ginger along with the cactus to cut down on the nausea.  I own a juiceman type juicer, so this was pretty easy.  I put on some didg music and started despining the freshly cut 22' section of cactus.  Once all the spines were gone I juiced it with a  hunk of ginger about the size of a small lemon.  I added about a 1/4 tsp of citric/malic acid blend that I got from a local homebrew shop.  This yielded about a beer glass and a half (~24 oz) of cactus juice.  I was expecting it to be really foul, but the taste wasn't that bad.  The texture, however, was WAY high on the revolting scale.  Adding ice helped a lot, and the ginger did cut the taste quite a bit.  I choked it down & meditated to start the trip.  I've found this to be a great way to get a good mindset going before tripping.  <BR>
<BR>
It took about an hour to come on, and it was great stuff.  Good visuals, very nonthreatening, but at the same time it definitely delivered the goods.  I took a walk through my neighborhood which was absolutely amazing - everything was so alive & I felt a sense of connectedness to everything.  I came home because a wave of nausea came on, & I thought I might puke.  I didn't, & being indoors wasn't much fun, so I went on another walk, which was great.  I was accosted by a pack of roving Mormons, but I was totally OK with talking with them & letting them be on their trip while I was on mine.  I continued on my walk and started to come down a bit (maybe 4 hours after I drank the juice).  Coming down wasn't a whole lot of fun as the nausea was still there but most of the good effects had worn off, but it wasn't too bad.  I didn't feel like eating anything much all day because of the nausea, which came and went.  At one point I walked past a cactus, but I couldn't look at it because it made me want to puke, which made me burst out laughing at the ridiculousness of it.  <BR>
<BR>
Overall it was definitely a worthwhile trip but something I'm not in any rush to do again.   It's great stuff but plan on taking a full day for it, and feeling a little hungover the next day as well.  The ginger helped a lot but I was left wondering if it might have been better to have just puked and got it over with rather than riding out the nausea.<!--   End Body   -->

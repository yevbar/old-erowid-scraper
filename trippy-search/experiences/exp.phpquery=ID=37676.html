42mg iprocin at ~23.20 in a capsule. I take garbage out and go biking at the same time. I get to that old railway bridge when I realize my tire has flattened. I have to walk home. It has been almost an hour since I swallowed the capsule and clearly that chemical has made its way to my serotonin receptors now. Everything is bright. I reach the doorsteps of my home. I step from constantly humming and hissing sounds of autumn winds to the silence of my home. Dishwashing machine is ready. I switch it off. I stand listening the silence for a moment. I sit on the floor carefully and close my eyes. I take several deep breaths and concentrate on my inner self. Infinity lands upon me and shows me my family downstairs as if I could sense their auras. Behind my closed eyelids I see myself as a shining insect-like creature, my long legs swooping through space. This is the hollow spiritual state of mind that I always end up at if I just concentrate while under the influence of psychedelics. I feel clean, purified.<BR>
<BR>
After some time I open my eyes and realize that my computer keeps hissing sounds, so I go to living room. I notice other humming. I wish I was in a complete silence. Sensing is very detailed. I get some fruit salad, grab my headphones and put some slow ambient albums on the playlist.<BR>
<BR>
My mouth is dry. Like sand. I open my eyes. Faint light from the window paints the ceiling and walls into bluish patterns. My bottom has fallen asleep. Some extremely slow and quiet track is playing, i don't recognize it. I turn myself to sideways and finish listening to the track. Some bits and pieces start coming back. Infinite kaleidoscopic cascades, a never-ending cosmic beach, swirling currents going around the singularity like galaxies turning and twisting around their centre of mass through the course of billions of years. I glance at the clock on my computer. Almost 3 hours has passed since I put my headphones on. I am coming down quite fast. I try to keep memories of those cascades fresh in my mind, but they slip away further and further as the chemical loses its grip of my consciousness. <BR>
<BR>
What I have left 6 hours after ingesting the iprocin are just faint images of those cosmic revelations that I went through. Human mind as in the usual state of consciousness with its evolutionary burden of social games, duties and worries, is simply not able to carry those experiences along. They are buried deep down to prevent them from disturbing our games of life, only to return the next time I let some powerful entheogens inside my body. I close my computer, kiss my daughter and go to sleep.<!--   End Body   -->

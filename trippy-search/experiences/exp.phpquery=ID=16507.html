I have had interest in psychedelics and these newer 'research chemicals' for quite some time. I read many trip reports, and discovered and read as much info as I could on 5-meO-dmt. Then one day after reading some more reports about it, I decided that it was my turn to experience the 'terrifyingly orgasmic'(a title of a trip report, and probably the most simple way to describe it) chemical. I ordered 100mg from an online research company. I was looking for an experience to give me insight, or some kind of a spiritual connection I have been looking for, and wisdom, not to get high. I was excited, and nervous about trying this new chemical. I am experienced with a few psychedelics, like acid, xtc, pot, and salvia d.<BR>
<BR>
I made a simple, vaporizer type thing, by wrapping foil around a pencil and then carefully shaping a 'bowl' for it. Then, the moment came. The package arrived. I anxiously opened the package. It came in a tiny ziploc bag, as light brown, flaky crystals. It smelled odd, a friend told me it smelled like new shoes to him. I waited until night to try it. It was difficult loading these somewhat sticky, damp crystals into my pipe. I took a business card, folded it in half to make a crease and took a bend out paperclip, and scraped the crystals onto the card, then into the pipe, very carefully. I took a few deep breaths, and briefly meditated. I estimate my first dose was about 5mg. I held the flame under the foil, and gently inhaled. It didn't taste bad, not like burnt plastic, but a plasticky taste was noticeable on exhalation. The threshold effects felt like nitrous, with a touch of acid. I was plesently suprised with a great body feeling, like warm, flowing energy. My thoughts remained unchanged, unlike with most other psychedelics I have tried. I heard a slight buzzing noise, and I also could feel this noise in a physical way. I received no visuals at this dose. I had a slightly faster heartbeat, and looking in the mirror I saw that my pupils were dilated. The body buzz lasted about 5 minutes, then gradually diminished over the next 10 minutes. I felt very excited to have such a chemical in my possession. I felt a great urge to try a bigger dose, but I waited until the next night. <BR>
<BR>
I decided to double the dose, to approximately 10mg. I loaded the pipe, and took a hit, trying to hold it in for a long time. The effects come so quick. I felt like I had an electric current flowing gently through me. I connected this feeling to the buzzing noise I heard. There is a rising peak, where I experienced the feeling of 'Wow, this is amazing'(the physical feeling). I did have some slight, acid like visuals this time. I felt dissociated, like floaty, but my thoughts were not really affected. My heart was racing, and I did feel a slight panicked feeling, like adrenaline flowing. After the first minute of rising effects, the feeling seemed to turn into more of a stoned feeling, the feeling of the 'void', emptiness where my thoughts slowed, along with the buzzing feel. It lasted probably 10 minutes, and I felt 'speedy' for another hour. I was impressed, but still felt I needed to explore the higher dose range. The next day I experimented with a low dose (around 5mg) with a friend. I put some in the pipe for him and he hit it. He laid back and said, 'that tastes weird', then his pupils dilated. He exhaled and had an anxious look on his face. I asked him how he felt and he said, 'my body feels fucked up...I feel kinda speeded out.' <BR>
<BR>
I didn't try it for a few days after that, I was saving it. Then one night, (last night), I decided it was time to try a serious dose. I put on some Pink Floyd music, which played quietly in the background. The setting was my bedroom, on my bed, where most of my previous experiences have been (this was, I think my 5th time doing it). I had the pillows arranged so I could either lay down almost flat or have my head propped up. I placed what I think was about 20mg into the pipe, and set it down. I did some deep breathing, and focused on the relaxing music. It took me a few moments before I was completely ready. I lifted the pipe to my mouth, lit, and inhaled. I could taste it pretty clearly this time. It did not taste bad, just a little weird. Its hard to put what happened next into chronological order or even describe it exactly, but I'll do my best.<BR>
<BR>
I felt an intense rush, a feeling of sudden movement. I felt panic, my heart was going so fast. I began to think I was dying, but remembered that this feeling is normal for this drug. That was the first 5 seconds. I then saw amazing visuals, which I cannot clearly remember, but I do remember everything in my room melting, bending, and floating around. I am not religious, but I felt an inner presence, trying to escape. This feeling is impossible to describe, terror would be the closest description. My thoughts shattered into nothing. I lost sense of self, and my environment. Its not that I didn't know who or where I was, it was absense of conscious thought. Absence of time and ego. Everything seemed to darken. The visuals were still present, intensely. I laid down flat and took deep breaths. It was as if I was experiencing something truly amazing, a once in a lifetime thing. The terror faded some as I entered into this void. The empty feeling started to get replaced by consious thought again. An understatement is I was amazed. I cannot describe the power, and the feeling, no one can, completely. I was happy to be alive.<BR>
<BR>
I had the 'rebirth' feeling as other reports mention. I was in a state of ecstasy at the comedown, a great happiness that I had just experienced this, and lived through it. I was still tripping hard but I call it a comedown compared to the extreme effects of the peak. I looked in the mirror and smiled at my suprised, 'wow' look, and very large pupils. I started gaining normal thought back. I would compare the coming down similar to a 100mcg trip on acid. The peak experience is not like acid at any dose, or any other drug I can think of, besides the slight resemblence to N2O. Its in its own category, like salvia is. <BR>
<BR>
It has been about 25 hours since the experience, and I am still feeling unsettling thoughts and anxiety about what I had experienced. I feel a need to analyze this trip. I would recommend a sitter for this drug since it is quite mind blowing, but I don't think I could move during the peak. I will probably experiment with this again in the future when I am ready again. I don't feel there is much to learn from this chemical in a spiritual way, it is a kind of a stoning drug as Shulgin described it. It is much more than that though...<!--   End Body   -->

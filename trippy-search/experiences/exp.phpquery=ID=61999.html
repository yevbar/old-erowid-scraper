Now Before this dreadful night I’d had numerous experiences with MDMA, Amphetamines, Cocaine, Hash/weed, Opium and various strains of Shrooms and so I guess I had slightly more knowledge of psychedelics than my friends I was to be tripping with.<br>
<br>
Setting,<br>
The night began when I visited my friend 'E's flat, at the top floor of his dads bed and breakfast. I arrived in normal spirits yet hadn’t expected to be eating any mushrooms, only smoking odd joints and certainly a drink or six. I had however, recently been on some strong trips- five or six- the previous month on ‘cyanascens’ a POWERFUL strain which grows naturally from wood chippings here in southern England.<br>
<br>
It so happened my friend ‘A’ had acquired several batches of Stropahria cubensis, from a source in the Netherlands. At approx 9pm I was offered a pile weighing 4 Grams which was swiftly washed down with some wine, while my companions, E, J, A and T had already eaten 5 or 6 Grams about 45 minutes before my arrival. The manifesting effects were glitteringly evident in J, A and E who were laughing uncontrollably, and in a tone and manner which was very different from there normal hysterics. This was something that had kind of freaked me out minor on a previous trip, not because it was disturbing (which it was) but because I was often not quite in the same state as them, “Tripping Balls” to quote.<br>
<br>
At T+ 1 hour I had began to get that giddy confused rush coupled with a familiar euphoric anticipation. Me and J’ had just stepped out to go and pick up some weed off a source of mine who was somewhat inconvenient. I waited patiently for 35mins with J for a very busy supplier, it being only a few days before Christmas he had many customers so we were forced to wait. J was getting understandably doubtful and occasionally forgetting I was there while tripping over the  sight of the scaffolding net.<br>
<br>
T+1hr 45 and we’re back smoking nice fruity spliffs inside from the cold. We all were feeling strong effects but weren’t quite peaking yet, with the exception of T who told me that he was only feeling minor effects and was of the opinion that they wouldn’t hit him properly. I sat back in my chair and swilled down mouthfuls of wine trying to convey to him the deceiving character of the mushroom. I was also keenly observing his eyes, which normally sparkled blue in contrast with his ginger hair, but had become black from pupil dilation. Then after passing me a joint he informed me that he had to leave to have a roast dinner with his mum and grandparents…<br>
<br>
T+2hrs We are now reaching our peak and conversation had become a random stream of difficult gibberish. I felt I was not in an ideal atmosphere at this point and began to get the ‘restless and confined’ feeling that many seem to get also. T had just left in a highly strung state, feeling very paranoid about going for the meal and had poured wine in his hair to disguise himself as drunk. A was laughing hysterically making me go into creases too. We kind of sloshed around in his very littered flat, occasionally slipping on plates and crashing into furniture E and J were practically incapable of putting any visual entertainment on the computer. We staggered and babbled to and from one another passing a surviving spliff which hilariously resembled a crappy chip as we all were past capable of rolling another.<br>
 <br>
T+2hrs 45 We were all in a very incoherent way and went through waves of confusion, laughter and soon enough, fear. I was enjoying myself but hadn’t actually taken a single minute to think to myself about where I was mentally, or anything actually, for ages. I spent a couple of quiet minutes on the sofa stoking half a joint and watching in good humour, the condition of my companions. It was very messy. A seemed in an absolute state of hysterics, J was giggling and walking around doing a lot of things I can’t remember and E kept looking at everybody with a couple of blank glazed orbs and saying shit like, “Pardon? What’s happening man? Fuck, did we eat something?”<br>
<br>
I was on a wave which told me to sink another beer or two as I was still not managing to keep up with all the madness, when E went crashing into A and fell very heavily into his T.V causing it to crash to the floor alongside him. This made the whole room fall silent, and at first I thought A had knocked him out somehow as I was gazing very distortedly when it happened.<br>
<br>
E began to jerk and spasm on the carpet for about twenty seconds before stopping. I began loosening his collar and trying to get a grip on things as J had just ran over seizing E’s hand shouting “ Oh my god! Ed! Ed! Ed!!!!!!!! A was also attending to poor Ed and we looked at each other, both holding our heads in shock. I opened one of his eyelids and it was also clear he was still breathing. We momentarily considered an ambulance but I insisted he would come around and we should take it easy. J became quite nasty snapping at me saying “ No, no he’s not alright, how is this fucking alright?! E had been down no longer than three minutes before he came around very shaken but remarkably clear headed in comparison to the previous events which now seemed like a whole other reality.<br>
<br>
T+3hrs  E is hanging his head down the toilet and is shoving his arm down his throat desperately trying to vomit the poison from his system. A is on the floor in the corridor next to him making sure he doesn’t pass out, choke etc. J appears very pale at this point and any attempt I made at humouring him was met with a lot of coldness. J no longer seemed to want to communicate with me after his freak out, and got even more testy when I suggested we should shrug it off and settle down. “Hey, I’m just trying to get some fucking levity here man” I exclaimed, but J had dropped me. A was kind of in the same 'jumpstart to the system’ state of clarity that I was in but was very quiet. It was then I turned toward J in horror to see him sliding down against a cupboard unconscious but eyes open and sank to the floor in a very alarming way. It really looked like he had just kicked it and died of shock right there in front of us.<br>
<br>
E was unaware of this at first and me and A once again stared on in disbelief as we began dropping like flies. At this point panic coursed through me very intensely. However J was quickly coming around and muttering absolute shit, which was quite nerve racking. Me and A both decided that this must be the result of liver poisoning, we both felt flutters of panic as E came back to life, and in a strange monotone began repeatedly saying “CALL AN AMBULANCE, CALL AN AMBULANCE.”<br>
<br>
T+ 3hrs 30  We all had all cooled down a lot, the whole event having neutralised our trip to a certain extent. E was still severely freaked and was near tears when A and me humoured him in a way that struck memories with me of a teacher trying to cheer the spirits of a schoolboy that’d fallen and grazed his knee.<br>
<br>
“Well it’s a fucking wake up call for me, mate” Said E glumly, sniveling and pulling on a cigarette. I genuinely felt for him a that moment as it was such an innocent emotion he was experiencing, and so I think I gave the bugger a hug. A and myself went and sat with J who was sitting bewildered on the sofa in a deep contemplation. Then A & J began singing a familiar old song of bollocks, announcing with no conviction that they would not be ever using any drugs again. This I found a little annoying as I knew (and was correct) that within weeks they’d be dropping ecstasy and sniffing coke again. I ventured an unwelcome bit of wisdom that with drugs, especially psychedelics, that one should either jump in with both feet or not at all. <br>
<br>
T+4hrs I couldn’t leave any sooner, I’d sat stoking the remaining weed with A and J before hitting the road with A I left saying stuff like “No hard feelings huh? But everyone seemed too spaced to respond  anyway, and I also know that J was bitter with me for some petty reason, mainly that I shunned his initial overreaction and he may have felt some kind of ego flop. After getting outside I instantly felt ten-times-better, the cold, sobering December air was pleasing, but was left feeling alone and graduated to a sort of spooked reverie. I walked through the train station experiencing some strong alterations in perception and auditory distortions which lifted my spirit’s a little.<br>
<br>
T+4hrs 30 I ended up calling on one of my closest friends, Joe, and sank a chain of beers which refreshed my mind to a very good state, and after getting the whole ordeal off my chest and laughing about it I actually felt in a very good way, experiencing an afterglow which afforded a state of mental clarity and an open minded optimism which made me feel very thankful and ‘At peace’.<br>
<br>
I’ve not taken psychedelics since (4 months) but have every intention of tripping soon, but in the future will not take with people who I am perhaps uncertain of, and certainly not in the casual way which was done that night, which I feel is very disrespectful of the enormity of the Mushrooms power. I am now considering, but not searching for, a hit of the world famous LSD but in safe and natural conditions of course.<!--   End Body   -->

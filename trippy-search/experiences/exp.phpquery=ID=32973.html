The first time I did it was actually last Sunday. It was about 9 at night and I had read many trip reports for Dramamine. I was excited because the one experience I had with shrooms was very weak and disappointing, and acid hasn’t been seen in my town since forever. Because I didn't know if I had any allergic reactions to the chemical I started off carefully with just two 25mg pills. After a half an hour passed I figured I was safe. So I took 5 more.<br>
<br>
Within 30 minutes I was feeling a vague stoned feeling where music kind of goes through me and when I stand up I feel almost a rush. This was the extent of having taken about 7 pills, 175 mg. So I took 5 more, but to no prevail. I was getting a somewhat paranoid feeling after a while so I decided to smoke a bowl of pot. This kind of alleviated the paranoia because I am an experienced pot smoker and it made me realize that this was just a drug. The only 'tripping' I experienced was occasional patterns on the ceiling which is very textured. Occasionally I'd see things go bye me out of the corner of my eyes. Also by this time I felt nauseous.<br>
<br>
So finally I said screw it and I took 8 more. I waited an hour, then another half an hour, finally I felt really stoned and massively tired. The experience came to a halt when I decided to sleep it off because it was just wasting my time. The next morning I woke up with a hangover worse than an alcohol-induced hangover. Firstly my mouth was incredibly dry, so I had to drink water asap. My head was pounding so I took advil, my stomach hurt, and my lower back where my kidneys are was incredibly sore. I had to pee a lot during the 'trip' which was scary because bathrooms can get creepy when your on the verge of hallucinating because of the mirrors and small spaces. I felt like my IQ had gone down about 50 points and I still was seeing things out of the corner of my eyes.<br>
<br>
The hangover lasted till that night at around 9, and my back, where my kidneys are, was sore until the following Tuesday morning. This is not an experience worth repeating, I thought seeing some exciting hallucinations would be fun, cos I never had an experience like that, but it just resulted in a bad hangover that lasted too long and a sore back for some reason. It wasn't worth it!<!--   End Body   -->

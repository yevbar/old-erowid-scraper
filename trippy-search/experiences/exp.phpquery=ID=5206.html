My previous experiences with drugs involved weed and shrooms. So when given the chance to try meth I jumped on it. I had acquired this from a friend. <BR>
<BR>
I decided to do it on a weekend so I would not have to report to anyone. I layed out a line about 9:00 PM. It as long as the cap on a pen and rolled up a twenty dollar bill and snorted it. Immediately there was an intense burn and my eyes were on fire. I was showed before to inhale some water off your fingers to help it drain better so I did this. After about five minutes I felt a warm sensation all over my body and in my brain. I had not eaten anything and I was in a pretty good mood prior to this. My mood was enhanced x10 and I noticed my jaw clenching. All sensation of hunger had completely diminished to nothing.<BR>
<BR>
I noticed that my senses had become sharper and my thoughts were racing. My heart was beating pretty hard to. Compared to ephedrine it was 100x better without the shaky feeling. This feeling lasted for around four or five hours with no real comedown. I decided to do another line around 3:00 AM anyway. This time there was an immediate rush and I felt even better than before. <BR>
<BR>
Unlike other stimulants this one effected my mind alot. I was thinking of all kinds of crazy shit. I thought about how much I really enjoyed people and I realized how much I cared for my family and friends. Things that didn't really matter. I decided to go riding around. (Keep in mind that is three o'clock in the morning). At this point I decide to save what I had left because I had heard that the comedown was a bitch. So I rode around till around 6:00 AM and still feeling very wired. My mind had pondered so many things so fast it was crazy. <BR>
<BR>
I stayed like this well into the next day when I could feeling wearing off around 1:00 PM. This must have been what they meant by a comedown because I was feeling like major shit. I decided to do what was left. The effects were rapid and very pleasing, the same as before. This last bump lasted till about 6:00 PM. I decided it was time to go to bed. But when I layed down I couldn't go to sleep because my mind was still racing and I couldn't slow it down. I realized how truly addictive this substance was because I would have given anything to feel better which really hurt my pride. <BR>
<BR>
For several days afterward my chest hurt when I took a breath probably do the fact that I really pushed my heart pretty damn hard. <BR>
<BR>
I decided after this experience that with all of its positive feelings that it wasn't worth it. Don't get me wrong this is an amazing substance but should be used with great caution. The negative aspect is its highly addictive. I would not even think about shooting it because of this. I am grateful to have been blessed with strong willpower.<!--   End Body   -->

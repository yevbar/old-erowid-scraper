I was recently able to try this material for the first time. In my opinion, if you are looking for an ‘ecstasy alternative’ don’t waste your time and money on this. <BR>
<BR>
I took 200mg initially orally (on an empty stomach). After about 10 or 15 minutes, I was coming up. After half an hour I felt waves of well-being washing over me, but no real euphoria. There were no visual enhancements. At the one hour point I decided on a booster of 150 mg, because I didn’t feel satisfied.<BR>
<BR>
Ten minutes later a friend came round, unexpectedly, and started telling about a suicide case, which put me in a negative frame of mind. I had to asked him to leave, eventually. He said that I looked like I had had ‘five shots of whisky.’ By the time my friend left, my mood had turned and I think the booster was too much. I started getting pronounced nystagmus, which was wearing. My mood became dysphoric. I can only describe my feelings as being like the negative mental after effects of speed or too much MDMA. After an hour or so (by which time I wished that I had spent my time and money on something else), I had a brief spell of feeling good, with MDMA type enthusiasms, but mixed with a rather drunken-type feeling. I almost fell asleep and had some CEVs or brain movies, probably the most enjoyable part of the experience.<BR>
<BR>
After three hours, most of the effects were gone, to my relief.  After four hours I was baseline and able to sleep. The next day I had an irritating hangover and was very stiff (my neck ached). In many respects, this material is more like alcohol than MDMA.<BR>
<BR>
The web has a few positive (if not all very enthusiastic) reports about MBDB. Perhaps think the key to an enjoyable experience is to keep the dose lower and to avoid a booster. I am, however, in no hurry to repeat this experience.<!--   End Body   -->

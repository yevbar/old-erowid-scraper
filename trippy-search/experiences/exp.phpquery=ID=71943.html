I will start by saying that I have smoked pot very infrequently, only about 5 times previously. I am no expert on drugs, I just read a ton of information and have a stoner friend who is a wealth of info.<br>
<br>
I heard from my friend and on the internet that Damiana and Catnip can induce an interesting 'legal high' which I was curious to look into. I went to my local health food store and sure enough, they have a huge section with big ziploc bags full of these herbs. I found the Damiana and Catnip and other herbs in bags of 50g for about $3.50 CAD a bag. What a deal! <br>
<br>
I ran home and tried making some of the tea out of the damiana and I did not really feel anything. In fact the first two times I was playing around with the stuff I felt little effects.<br>
<br>
However my last try yesterday was a completely different story. I think the first times I hadn't really used enough of the herbs to make the tea. <br>
<br>
My parents have a small 1-cup iron teapot with a sieve piece that fits in the top and the leaves just soak through the sieve. It was a pretty large screen so I decided I would try 1 Tbsp of Damiana and mix it with 1 Tbsp of catnip. There is very limited information on the internet about the dosages of these two so I decided I would benchmark it here. This is a lot more than I used the first time. Also, I steeped this in rapid-boiling water for 10 entire minutes. I figured the longer it had to dissolve the actual medicinal properties from the leaves the more effective. I only steeped the tea for about 3 minutes the first time. I used 1 cup of boiling water in the tea.<br>
<br>
After this I added just a bit of honey to the mix and drank it down relatively fast. It's not a bad-tasting combination, it's actually quite subtle. So I drank that down and my mom was in the living room so I decided just to fool around playing piano a little bit.<br>
<br>
After about 15 minutes I stood up and I knew it had hit me. I was feeling slightly numb all over, my legs and arms were feeling heavier and I just felt generally relaxed. I went downstairs and tried listening to some tunes on the computer but it was the wrong setting so I went outside and sat on my deck. It was a beautiful, clear evening out, birds singing, all the good stuff. I was just completely relaxed. <br>
<br>
Let me just clarify this is not an identical high to weed, it's not a psychadelic, you won't be inquisitive of shit and you won't be all giddy or anything. This is like just being calm and forgetting about all your stresses. I love it, I tend to stress easily at times (like exam time right now).<br>
<br>
The whole peak lasted about 45 minutes. I had another mug with the same dosage afterwards just for kicks but it didn't seem as strong, probably because I was still feeling the effects of the last dosage. As I came down I became sleepy so I decided to call it an early night and went to bed about an hour earlier than normal. It took no time to sleep.<br>
<br>
This is where the second part of the drink stands out.(I believe it's the Damiana in particular). This drink is a powerful dream enhancer. All night, I had vivid dreams, like little bits of big dreams. It was like flipping through the channels on TV and it was VERY entertaining. I woke up, and 30 minutes after waking up and typing this I can still remember a few of the dreams. <br>
<br>
I would definitely reccommend this to someone who feels like relaxing or having a neat dreamscape all night. Obviously take things into moderation, look at my body weight and estimate that with the dosage I took. The best part is, this is all legal! My parents found the teas and I just said it's legal and it's better than pot. They couldn't argue so I even let them have some haha!<br>
<br>
Here's the recipe I used if anyone is interested:<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
-1 Tbsp. Damiana leaves, dried.<br>
-1 Tbsp. Catnip leaves, dried.<br>
-1 cup boiling water<br>
<br>
Place the leaves in a tea ball or similar. Make sure the tea leaves have room to float around a bit. I think a small teaball will not work as well. Steep 10 minutes and sweeten with liquid honey to taste.<br>

It was Saturday 7 of April and I met up with my closest friend whom I had not seen for a number of weeks we had some alcohol and hash and decided to take some magic mushrooms which I had stored in some organic honey.  It was difficult to measure dosage so a few teaspoons per cup of tea was to do the trick.  We drank it down and noticed effects within 30 min.<BR>
<BR>
The effects were confusing and frustrating, however within the hour we had settled into a very intense trip with short-term memory lapses and visuals etc. that are common in decent trips.  A few hours passed and we began to feel like coming down so we smoked a few bowls of hash.<BR>
<BR>
All was going well until I felt all the blood-vessels on my neck dilate and pulsate in a very distressing way I asked for my good friends hand to help calm me (it was just the two of us in my flat at about 3:40am) but something was pulling me away from the physical world and my vision closed up and I sank deeeeep into my brain and away to another place.  An intense rush of visuals and emotions followed and I felt as though something was communicating with me..... my vision opened again to the sight of my friend screaming into my face to 'stay with me'.<BR>
<BR>
We decided to get some air and go outside (I wretched on myself) I stood up and collapsed next to the door in the room and fell away again I briefly saw myself from about 2 meters away in a state of seizure with my throat extremely pronounced and dilated.  I again came to as my friend helped me up once more but this time I hesitated as I wanted to go back to find out something and I repeated to my friend (who was now in a serious state of shock) that 'its ok its ok its good'.<BR>
<BR>
I made it to the top of the stairs where I was launched into the cosmos once more where a 1000 images and emotions blasted through my being.  The most predominant one was of a fish like embryonic creature that wasn't separate to me but was everything that I know or could know-past, present, future..... everything.  I can’t explain what IT was but it was not negative but was very otherworldly yet with a distant familiarity.  This sounds like bollix but I cant really understand what I felt/saw.<BR>
<BR>
We made it to the cold bathroom where I regained myself however my mate and I were very traumatized for another few hours as we tried to piece my mind together with another friend who thankfully and randomly called by after the clubs.  I shall never forget this and will be far more careful and respectful of the Shrooms in future as during one of the 'seizures', my friend said that I did not breathe for about 1min.  It is also worthy of note that I had been taking St. John's wort for depression for about a month. Thanks for reading this and take care.<!--   End Body   -->

Amount: 40mg oxycodone (Eight Roxicets, 5mg oxycodone each) ingested oraly on an empty stomach.<BR>
<BR>
DOSE T+ 0:00<BR>
Weight: 120lbs<BR>
<BR>
Note:<BR>
Four 5mg Ritalin pills were taken earlier in the day @12:00. I also took Adderall (amphetamine) and Ritalin (methylphenidat) the last 2 days.<BR>
<BR>
Date:  Thursday, January 10th, 2002<BR>
	<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:00 Dose taken <BR>
T+ 0:10 Starting to feel the onset of it - just sitting here typing this.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:14 sitting here typing this. ahhhhhhhhh the rush is coming on I feel slightly in control, calm, peaceful.  But since I have done this before I know it gets more intense.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:16	Im going to go sing along to music and play pool now as it is a  great activity to do on opiates. Feeling drowsy.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:20 Balance off, it feels wierd to walk, something is up with my eyesight but I can't quite put my finger on it, blurry would be the closest word I can think of, but it's weirder than that.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:23 Nose & face a bit itchy.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:25 I notice that my hands are shaky as I'm loading CD's into the CD player.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:26 Going to the bathroom, pupils are smaller than normal.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:30 I notice my motor skills and coordination are off as I finish loading up the CD player and select the the track I want to hear.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:31 Listening to Kid Rock's Devil Without A Cause. I'm feeling pretty drowsy :) and more itchy :(<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:33 Mouth a bit dry, So I drink a Pepsi.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:35 playing pool with myself, just shooting around practicing shots. My aim seems to be better on oxycodone despite my semi-shaky hands and loss of coordination.  I'm not sure why this is.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:37 Feeling kind of nausea, but I'm not worried about throwing up.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:40 Shooting great pool, I'm making several shots in a row.	I'm so happy right now, I would like to be like this all day.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:45 I'm begining to notice that I'm having slight audio hallucinations, like hearing small noises that aren't there.Also some slight visual hallucinations, thinking I see something move nearby but nothing alive is even close to me.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:53	Very sleepy, starting to shoot worse, feely a bit ansy and jittery.  Possibly from that damn Pepsi I drank.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:57	Quickly finished up my game of pool after getting irritated from missing some easy shots.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:58	Gunna put go play some slower songs.  I'm nodding now. 'Only God Knows Why' is playing right now.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 1:00 Wish my girl friend was over right now so I could cuddle with her by the fireplace as I nod off in her arms.  Yes oxycodone turns me into a pussy :-P<BR>
<BR>
T+ 1:05 Sitting by the Fireplace nodding and writting this.  I 	almost fell into a deep sleep, good thing I was able to wake myself up otherwise my parents could have found me 	passed out on the couch a few hours later. :-P<BR>
<BR>
T+ 1:07	Pupils are small but I have seen them smaller on previous doses.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 1:10	I'm feeling slightly paranoid with the small audio/visual hallucinations.  Occasionaly I get paranoid about ghosts while on this stuff.  Again this isn't the first time having paranoia or thinking about spirits while on a opoid/opiate.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 1:15	Nose very itchy, I'll have to put some Benadril anti-itch on my face in a little bit.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 1:25	Uneasy and restless for some reason, though I suppose I could fall asleep if I realy wanted to.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 1:35 I got hungry so I started to snack on some Original Flavored potato chips.<BR>
 <BR>
T+ 1:40	I'm not realy feeling the 'warm fuzzy feeling' anymore. This trip isn't feeling like the typical high I get, usualy I peak and feel the best 1 hour after taking it (45 minutes after I feel it kick in).  I think that taking Adderall (speed) and Ritalin (speed) for 3 days in a row including today might have something to do with it.  Possibly because my body might be low on dopamine with all the speed lately.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 2:15	Went back up to my room, now I'm going to take a nap :) while I listen to a mixed CD that has a lot of soft rock and songs that aren't loud. I actualy named the CD 'The Land Of Nod'. I made this CD for the purpose of listening to while I nod off, so that I don't get distracted/paranoid about little noises in the house. I usualy am asleep for about 30 minutes or so but you can never tell for sure, I've been out for as long as 3 hours. :)<BR>
<BR>
T+ 2:47	I didn't sleep as well as I would have thought or liked to have. I kept on falling asleep for about 2 minutes and then I would wake up again feeling kind of nervous and a bit agitated.  Plus I'm still feeling a little nausiated.  So I finaly decided to quite tying to fall asleep and finish this up.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Opiods and Opiates are definatly my favorite drugs to do, though I would have liked the high to have been for 'full and wholesum' like it usually is, I still had fun.  That first onset rush in the begining where time seems to stand still while there is a defening roar in your head makes it all worth while.  If it would have gone the way I had wanted it to,  I would have felt the way I did when it first hit me the whole 45 minutes till the peak.  Well I hope that you enjoyed reading my trip report, and hopefully you even learned something.  Just be careful with this stuff.  I'm not trying to be all holy and stuff, but I have been addicted to this stuff and I still kind of am.  Sometimes I wish I hadn't even done it once, but most of the time I have no regrets about doing it.  Anyway try to not to trip every day that's how I got addicted.<BR>

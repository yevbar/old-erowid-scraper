<!--   Start Body   -->


I'm 17, in my senior year of high school and suffer from depression, GAD, OCD, and social anxiety. It got to the point where I could no longer pay attention in class, my OCD comes along with a lot of mental rituals. So now I get tutored at home and am on Paxil, Lamictal and Zyprexa. These are not substances that I abuse, nor do they interact with Benadryl as far as I know. I've been abusing OTC drugs for about 2-3 months, I've tried basically everything. Last summer I abused Vivarin, Alcohol and the prescription medications Xanax, Klonopin and Ambien. I even tried Tylenol once or twice, thinking it had Codeine in it, maybe I should have read the label. Recently, it's been Tussin and Benadryl primarily. I tried Dramamine last week. The experience is equivalent to Benadryl as far as I'm concerned, maybe a little less cotton month. Two weeks ago I was hospitalized after I chugged an 8 oz. bottle of Robotussin, and now have to go to groups three to four times a week. I was clean for about a week and a half, and then got the brilliant idea to start up again.<br>
<br>
I was staying at my dad's place, and I told him I was going for a walk. I had to leave my wallet with my mom, but snatched 20 bucks from her purse. I've swiped bottles of liquor from grandparents and uncle, and feel terrible about it, but I can't say I won't do it again, because I'm an addict. So, I bought Dramamine, some Benadryl and Robitussin. I took them one by one every night, and last night I was down to 19 liqui-gels of Dye-Free Benadryl. I had initially decided to swallow only 17 of them, but then decided to go ahead and take the other two.<br>
<br>
It kicked in about an hour later, as I noticed the lines on the wall that seem to quiver. I also began to mildly hallucinate, seeing flashes of imagery before my eyes. It didn't matter whether they were open or closed. Watching TV, nothing spectacular happened. I looked back at the doors to my closet, and there seemed to be blotches of color somewhere between red and pink. I went downstairs to the bathroom, and saw the quivering lines in the toilet bowl. The side-effects were a pain in the ass to deal with, as they always are. Not being able to burp and making swallowing difficult. As I got up to wash my hands, I heard my mom call for me, or so I thought. I was suspicious that it was probably the Benadryl, so I went upstairs and asked. She hadn't called my name. I went back to my bedroom and continued to hear voices, they would sometimes come from outside of my room, but they were mostly in my head. I would respond to them in my head, I don't recall actually vocalizing. The voices ranged from a girl friend of me, my family, people I had talked to on the phone the previous day.<br>
<br>
It was impossible to located objects, it took me literally minutes to find the remote controls for my TV. It was also difficult to turn my lamp on, which I decided to place right next to my bed for convenience. I went to talk to my mom a couple of times, and would instantly forget what I was talking about. She picked up on it, and was debating as to whether or not I had taken anything. This afternoon I just told her I was sick. On the way back to my room it was dark and I saw blotches of colors once again, and loudly bumped into things. The voices continued for another 2 hours, or so, the patterns had begun to fade.<br>
<br>
I took 3 mg of Xanax along with some supplements around the 4 hour mark, and watched TV. After about another hour, I decided that I was going to walk to the drug store today and pick up some more shit before my mom got up. I ended up falling asleep. I took my walk in the late morning, disoriented since I had no recollection of falling asleep. I purchased 2 containers of Robitussin cough-gels and another package of Benadryl. I'm planning on doing the DXM tonight, along with 2 liqui-gels as I usually due to prevent an allergic reaction.<br>
<br>
One day I'll stop. I'm determined to. I guess it's just not my time. I don't know. God has given me many chances to redeem myself, and I still haven't learned my lesson. Everyone should be aware of the dangers of these meds. They're not something to fuck around with. I wish I had never started. I've got a long road ahead of me.<!--   End Body   -->

First, I would like to say that DXM is not a new substance to me, I've been using this for many and many trips and it's not as fun anymore. This was beyond a recreational dose and after a certain amount I just hit a delusional wall; I would like to share my experience meeting this wall.<BR>
<BR>
One night I had a small get together with some friends.  Only Marc and myself were up to using DXM.  Marc is an experienced user that I knew and trusted so we each took 700 mg.  Marc begins to feel it sooner than I do because he is an even lighter fellow then myself.  So, after fouty minutes or so, Marc starts jumping around and acting euphoric (something I can never feel under DXM's influence).  He begins to talk to everybody very empathetically and personally and he is dancing.  I begin to get angry at him because he is accidentally knocking stuff down and dropping things in my house.  Usually I would be happy for him that he is so ecstatic but he really bugged me.  He knew that I was upset and he sincerely apologized many times but I just get more and more angry at Marc.  Everything he said would make me wish he wasn't alive.  Well, my feelings were obviously DXM induced but the strange thing is, I never had such hostility under the influence and I didn't even know I was on it, I just thought it wasn't working yet.  I got so mad at the world I went down into my bedroom and took another 700 mg capsule.  'Fuck 'em' I thought.<BR>
<BR>
After 30 minutes of the second capsule I lay on the couch tired, knowing that if I went to sleep (common after using DXM too many times) that I would wake up into a delusional world.  I told Marc that I was afraid (I didn't really say it, it just seemed to slip out of my lips).  Marc got the people partying upstairs to come down and comfort me which I felt was highly unlogical seeing how I didn't really say that.  I must've fallen asleep because I didn't really know who I was for ten or so hours (although I was still feeling the effects 24+ after dosing).  I remember somehow managing to be in my bed around two hours after taking the second capsule.  I thought I was in a dark cave and I was figuring out something of the utmost importance.  For just two seconds, I realized I was on drugs (I didn't know what drug though) and that greatly soothed me, but I went back into that state again and I jumped out of my bed to tell everybody that I figured out the key to life, or something along those lines.  Next, I found myself lying on the couch staring at a Van Gogh print hanging on the wall.  It was stretched all strange and I didn't know who I was, what I was doing, the meaning of time, nothing.  I just stared at that painting and completely was lost in...God knows what.  I now know what an insane person feels and thinks.<BR>
<BR>
I woke up into a tiny midget house (common DXM effect, I was used to it) and went into the kitchen to get clues to who or what I was.  It was ten hours passed and the kitchen was swaying like a boat, back and forth, back and forth, my arms naturally moved to the rocking of the house.  This made my brother laugh, he was the only one home and he seemed twenty feet tall and five feet thick. He filled in the blanks on what time it was and so forth.  I was still messed up but at least I knew who I was...very relieving.  The next 15 hours I slowly came down and about 24 hours after the initial pill was ingested I was back to good ol' Sivvy Stilts. <BR>
<BR>
It was eerie to know I was out that far yet I didn't know it. DXM is a scary substance for me; whenever I'm under its influences I feel there is something BEYOND, like when I went to church as a kid and they told me my soul would be in Heaven for eternity...think about that, ETERNITY!  I always think there is something beyond everything and it scares me. I probably won't do DXM over a gram again (no promises though). I decided that the wall of delusions is best left not slammed into 1400 mg per mile.<!--   End Body   -->

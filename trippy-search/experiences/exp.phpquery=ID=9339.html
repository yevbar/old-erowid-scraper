From experiences with ecstacy over a six year period (im 22 now) its is evident that more you take on a regular basis the worse the experience. What im trying to say is, there was a stage where i was taking in excess of 8-10 pills per day, mainly during the evening at clubs and friends houses. It may sound a lot however i managed this for no more than about three weeks, as it took over my whole life - it seemed i was chasing the buzz the whole time, when i couldnt catch it i would roll over into a state of non-sleep but not being awake either. On a come-down it was easy to realise that this wasnt the same as the first time i took the drug, back then when i took my first pill it was like floating in heaven, while during that period it was more stress and fighting to get myself 'up'! It was a hard cycle to break (but it can be done) I decided to lay off to a month, i actually managed to go five weeks before taking the drug again...<BR>
<BR>
I arranged to go to a good club with lots of friends and saved myself for that night, i double dropped seeing as i was already used to the drugs and their effects, it was great! I did however take one more in halves to keep the high for that bit longer.. Now i dont take the drug that often, the most i do is say 12 pills in a month, still a lot but far better than the same amount in two days!<BR>
<BR>
To conclude i'd say that with most things you should place limitations on how many you allow yourself to do and the time periods you do them in, remember its not a game to see who can do the most - as that will only end with you both losing, and maybe losing more than just the game. <BR>
Two more quick bits, please only buy from people you trust (another personal experience) and watch you hydration levels!!  Take care! Mx<!--   End Body   -->

At t+0, which was 10:00 PM, I took one 7.5/200 tablet of Vicoprofen.  I then proceeded to play computer games.<br>
<br>
At t+30 I felt a very, very mild body buzz. It was so mild, I attribute it to a placebo effect.  I also experienced a slightly deeper appreciation of music. At this time I decided to take a second 7.5/200 tablet.<br>
<br>
At about t+50 it suddenly started to become more intense. In another 10 minutes, I decided to turn the computer off, and realized I was suddenly inspired to draw. Something I almost never do. From about 11:00 PM to 12:15 AM I did nothing but draw. I felt very artistic and inspired the entire time. I was at complete peace with myself.<br>
<br>
At t+2:15 I stopped drawing, and decided to lay down and read a little. At this point, my mind was becoming unsure of my mental condition. I thought the high was beginning to lessen a little, but as I stood up, I became dizzy and light headed and felt very high. Almost a cannabis-like high. I laid down to read.<br>
<br>
After about 20 minutes the high did not decrease, but started to come in spurts. For about 30 seconds to a minute, I would feel very normal, then for the next minute or so, it felt like waves of energy were pulsing through my brain. As this was a very comfortable feeling, I allowed it to continue.<br>
<br>
At t+4 hours (2:00 AM), these spurts of energy began to decrease, and I was taken over with fatigue instead. I decided to stop reading, and just laid in bed until I fell asleep, which was not long.<br>
<br>
In the morning, I awoke at 10:30 AM, feeling quite groggy. As I went into the bathroom, I noticed my eyes were completely bloodshot. So I put eyedrops in them and they were fine in a couple minutes. I had a very slight headache which lasted maybe an hour, but I did not feel at all hungover.<br>
<br>
I look back at this as a genuinely positive experience. I feel that I really got in touch with myself and my inner creativity. I also realize now that I was much higher than I thought I was at the time. I remember doing odd things which seemed normal at the time, like opening and closing the blinds 3 times, not knowing which way they wer supposed to be. However, this is definitely an experience I will look back on in a good light. The next day, I felt a slight urge to use this drug again, but I easily resisted, after having heard of addiction stories on this drug.<!--   End Body   -->

<!--   Start Body   -->


I am 25 years old.  I have a history of general anxiety.  I began taking Paxil a while ago and recently increased my dose.  I have Clonazepam on hand to use as needed, which is not a common occurance.  I smoke marijuana regularly and have taken Adderall, Ritalin and Focalin in efforts to combat ADD.  I drink 3-5 energy drinks a week.<br>
<br>
Long story short, I jumped from ADD medication, one to the next, and they worked.  For a short time.  On each medicine, I built a tolerance quickly and had to take larger doses in order to attain the same benefits, and quickly couldn't attain many benefits at all without a dose that would create problematic body response.<br>
<br>
I was prescribed 200mg Provigil (Modafinil) in an effort to find an alternative medication to assist with my ADD.  I was also prescribed the medicine to help combat the lethargy and excessive sleepiness I had begun to experience on my increased dose of Paxil.<br>
<br>
[EXPERIENCE]<br>
<br>
Having slept from 9am to 3pm on day 0, I found myself still wide awake in my apartment three hours into day 1, 3:00 AM.  Finally, at 4 AM I feel suddenly exhausted.  I would have just slept, but I needed to be awake at 7:30am to ship a package.  I didn't want to miss the overnight deadline with my carrier so I rationalized the use of some of the Provigil.<br>
<br>
4:10am  :  take 200mg Provigil tablet with full glass of Gatorade.<br>
<br>
I go back to my computer and try to play a videogame to stay awake until the medication kicks in.  I know my ways, and if I fall asleep as an upper is kicking in, all I get is fitful sleep.  I quickly realize the perfect time killer is a cigarette.<br>
<br>
4:25am  :  I was enjoying the view of the city lights reflecting off the clouds, but as I finished my cigarette my stomach started hurting.  I assumed it was the microwaved dinner food I ate just around midnight.  Either way, that cigarette sure kicked my head into working shape.<br>
<br>
4:32am  :  I'm not really sure it was the cigarette.  I remember that I have a relatively empty stomach, so I could be getting effects.  I'm actually a bit excited since this is the first time I've taken the medicine.  I want to see if my doctor and I have found a good solution.<br>
<br>
5:03am  :  Sorta forgot about the report, I found a guide for the game I was playing online and got caught up.  While playing I was taking mental notes of changes.  My 'accuracy' in the videogame was definitely increased from the time I loaded it up and closed it.  I would attribute it to natural skill, but I play the game at least a small bit everyday so I began to think this may be a similar effect between the Ritalin/Adderall stimulus and Provigil.<br>
<br>
5:30am  :  Its helping my ADD.  But not in a way I expected.  My mind almost subconsciously categorizes my thoughts and discards those of no import in the immediate future.  I started reading one of the Harry Potter books after the earlier note regarding gaming.  I found that I could read much like I can on Focalin:  I maintain a quick clip down the pages yet truly take in what I view, whereas without these types of aids I tend to go so many as 10 pages before noticing I do not recall the last several pages I read.<br>
<br>
There is something interesting here, though.  My body feels tired.  My arms and feet feel heavy.  But my head feels subtly electrified.  I had been listening to an EP (half-length music album) which I just received from a friend earlier that night, and upon first listens even in conjuction with reading learned most of the lyrics of all the songs.<br>
<br>
5:37am  :  200mg Provigil with half-liter of water.  I then go directly outside with the last of my pack of cigarettes, figuring I'd watch the sunrise, something I tend to sleep through.  It's lighter outside and I notice a third thing about the effects of this substance.  My vision seems to be improved.  Not in the sense that I could wear a lighter prescription of contacts or whatnot, but objects look much more defined.<br>
<br>
I was fascinated by this, and spent fifteen minutes trying to 'focus' my eyes, even 'zoom' them.  I noticed I could see the fine grains of our porch much more clearly than I recalled seeing them before.  It felt that prior to taking the medicine, my eyes were a digital camera that took perfectly recognizable pictures, but now had a few more megapixels to really sharpen the corners and make things 'pop.'  <br>
<br>
5:58am  :  I light the cigarette, and smoke about half of it slowly, enjoying another aspect of the medicine I noted:  confidence.  I felt very 'everything is alright.'  I live in a neighborhood with lots of theft and attempted breakins, even some armed holdups.  Anytime between 1am and 7am I feel uncomfortable being on our porch.  At this point in time, I felt - quite simply - logical, and my mind made no fuss over my body's current location as it usually does.<br>
<br>
As the cigarette came to its end, I noticed a very prominent buzzing feeling in my cranial area.  I would attribute it to the nicotine, but I smoke fairly regularly and the buzz was very, VERY similar to that of getting a triple tall extra shot latte at your local coffee shop.<br>
<br>
In total I took 400mg of Modafinil over the course of a few hours and smoked two cigarettes.  I have never felt this sort of mental clarity in my entire life.  It has an anti-anxiety/depression component to its use, that's a sure bet.  I simply felt logical, in control and irrational thoughts were turned away at the door, more or less.  In the time not covered, I felt extremely motivated (excited, actually) to clean my room and clean the porch.  Once I got the jobs done, I felt more rewarded than I ever have in my recent memory.  Yet, my mind was still being its old goofy self.  Jumping from subject to subject, but with such clarity.<br>
<br>
Modafinil seems to be something that could change a large portion of the population's lives.  I mean, I've also noticed that I feel more compassionate and inclined to do favors.  It's early afternoon now, but I still feel warm and aglow.  I was ecstatic when my apartment mate finally woke up so I could converse.  Maybe the medicine interacts with SSRIs, who knows, but it sure has a whole lot more to it than narcoleptics.  Yet, the commercials market the pill to people suffering from 'excessive sleepiness.'<!--   End Body   -->

After reading all the reports on this site and around the net, it almost had me scared away from trying MDPV. Almost.<br>
<br>
I feel I should provide some background. I'm a pretty large dude, I have been all my life. I have experimented with all your major drugs, as well as a lot of RC's. My favorite drugs tend to be psychedelics, but I'm one of those oddball dudes that really enjoys disassociatives. Been experimenting for about 10 years now with various substances, so I feel I can provide a good report.<br>
<br>
I tend to dislike stimulants, I much prefer the satisfaction of sleep to the high of tweaking. I was referred to a site giving away 2g samples of various RCs to build their credibility, and I ordered the mdpv. I have a good friend who really likes adderall but has a hard time finding any. I ordered it for him, because he's always buying me beers and doesn't like to smoke weed so I rarely get the chance to repay him.<br>
<br>
Anyways, the sample came in the mail and was a really really fine white powder. Even more fine than the JWH I had. So, I scooped out the size of a match head or so and dropped it on my phone. I had a plan to cut that pile in half and only do a guesstimated 5mg. Well, when I did the split bump, I accidentally got both.<br>
<br>
About 10 minutes later I started to feel myself coming up. My leg was bouncing around uncontrollably, and I had massive amounts of energy and motivation. I started doing some tasks around and got some things done. At about an hour, I felt the 'peak' of my experience. Not much euphoria, but a pleasant experience. <br>
<br>
While I was cleaning, I got a call from a buddy who wanted to hang out. 2 hours after my initial bump, I took a drive over to his house to pick him up. I felt completely back to baseline at this point. I figured he'd want to try some, so I measured him out a match head sized pile, and another for myself.<br>
<br>
This time, it was a lot more euphoric. We took a walk to the park near my house and just enjoyed the nice weather. We both spoke of how it made us feel like we could party for days. We made our way back home and played video games.<br>
<br>
I dropped him off around 10:30, and took some dph (benadryl) to sleep. 4 - 5 pills (I generally take 3 to sleep every 5 days or so). My sleep was sporadic, but I got a lot more sleep than I had originally figured I would.<br>
<br>
Small doses of this drug without redosing like a fiend, makes it a fun social aide, as well as a neat way to stay awake drinking all night.<br>
<br>
Self control is the name of the game, nothing more.<!--   End Body   -->

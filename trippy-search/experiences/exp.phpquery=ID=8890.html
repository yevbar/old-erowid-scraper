All year I was a straight-edge. No drugs what-so-ever. That is until the second semester, my freshman year in college. For the first half of the year,my roomate and our friends made it a nightly ordeal to smoke weed. I had not given into the temptation all year..but that was soon to change. After his constant pestering, my roomate somehow had convinced me to smoke pot. Needless to say I loved it.<BR>
<BR>
Growing bolder, I decided I wanted to take the next step. I wanted to take either acid or mushrooms. I had researched each, and knew the consequences and effects of both. So one friday night we all decided we were going to trip. Well we couldn't get our hands on either lsd or any mushrooms. One of our friends had suggested we trip off DEX. I had never heard of it, and niether did a few of the other guys. But my friend Ryan assured me that it was safe and we would have a kick ass time.<BR>
<BR>
Out of the seven of us tht wre there that night, only ryan and myself decided to take the trip. So we walked to wal mart and finally decided on coricidin cold and cough. After much debating, we each consumed an entire box at exactly 8:00pm. Since this was my first time tripping,I didn;t know what to expect. I had heard about the time dilation with other drugs, so I was sure to have my watch on the whole night. Anxiously I waited for it to happen. 8:15,8:30,8:45, nothing. At this point I was thinking that this bulshit wasn't going to work. I was literally out the door when my roomate came in and said we were going out for another 'session'. This meant all seven of us would walk down the block and smoke a few bowls. I thought to myself.. Hell yes, maybe I can still salvage this night.<BR>
<BR>
WE took our liesurly stroll down the block near the woods. The time now was 5 after 9. Ryan commented to me that he wasn't really feeling anything either, he said he just felt drunk. We then proceeded to smoke three bowls between all of us. I got about 5 hits, I'm not exactly sure. But after we were done, I was feeling good. The usual good after I smoke. That lasted maybe about two minutes. As soon as we started to walk back to our dorms, I knew something wasn't right. The street usually wasn't this long. At this point I was still thinking halfway normal. I immediately knew I was gonna start tripping soon. What gave it away was that I was still standing in the street. Nothin out of the ordinary, but I thought I was still walking. My roomate came and got me and asked me if I was allright. I said 'I don't know man, I know I'm not normal'<BR>
<BR>
It was still winter at the time, so as we walked back we were walking over other people's footprints. These footprints seemed like hundreds of feet deep. So being concerned about falling in, I tried to avoid all of them. My roomate asked what the hell I was doing. I then realized that what I was doing was absolutely crazy, and I walked back to my room.<BR>
<BR>
I have to say the trip was mostly mental. Not too many visual hallucinations. Minor ones. The most disturbing part of the night, and probably the most uncomfortable was the thoughts running through my head. Not disturbing or gross thoughts, just the number of them. I was sitting on my bed with these two girls from my dorm at 9:32. I had told them what I took and they agreed to stay with me until I fell asleep. I wish I could tell you what my friend ryan was doing at the time, but I was so focused on my bed and the people around me that anything else happening in the room was irrelevant. This is when all the thoughts came running into my head. The only way I can describe it is like this. There is a part of my brain that controls what I say. And this 'part' only lets me say one thought at a time. (for example I'm thinking about school, work, that I'm hungry, etc. But I only say 'hey I'm hungry let's get something to eat.') <BR>
<BR>
Well this part was broken. And I would have one thought, this would branch off to three different thoughts, and each of these would have five thoughts branch off from them. The end result of this being me thinking what seemed like 10 trillion different thoughts at one time. Apparently I was rambling on for about ten minutes about nothing at all. My roomate finally told me to shutup cause I was talking to much. I could sware that I was only talkin to these two girls about the TV show that was on.<BR>
<BR>
After he pointed out that I was talking for so long, I started to think about the time again. Now it was working against me. The five minutes after he told me felt like an eternity. The only world there was, or for that matter that ever existed, was in my room, on my bed. Outside the door was nothing, and if I went out there, I would be sucked into this enormous black hole...never to be seen again. It seemed like centuries later when time started moving again. I started going on about how I was never going to leave this 'world' and that the world that everyone else was in was not real. I distinctly remember feeling very upset that I was the only one in the 'real world'. I was almost in tears saying 'it's not real,it's not real', over and over and over again. The girls that were with me then started talking to me calmly, told me to lay down and relax. This was I think the best thing that could have happened to me. I felt so at home and warm and secure. (both of them were massaging my back so that wasn't too bad either) <BR>
<BR>
It was also the last time I looked at my watch. 10:47...hmmm I thought, what the hell does it matter anyway, there is no time. I took off the watch and my pants and layed back down. Thankfully they continued giving me the massage. Oddly it felt like there were little people running a marathon on my back. And that was the last thing I remmber before I passd out.<BR>
<BR>
I don't think I'll ever take coricidin again. It was a fun experience, but it was to the point where I couldn't control what I was doing or saying. That wasn't so cool. As for weed, I'll still smoke that. I don't regret doing DEX, but I definatley wouldn't trip off it a second time. I think it was an experience I needed to have. Just two hours seemed like an uexplainable amount of time had passed, and shit happened that I can't even begin to explain. All I have to say to future trippers is..good luck.<BR>

<!--   Start Body   -->


Administration: fingertip to tongue and a few sips of water.<BR>
me: male, 200#, almost 6 feet, 'late 20s, early 30s'<BR>
<BR>
12:00 noon burger, fries, & drink<BR>
<BR>
2:30p	3 to 4 mg dose<BR>
<BR>
2:45	+1 in effect. Something's happening!  Primarily, feel a little numb in mind. Feels like a light alcohol buzz, but with better clarity. Secondarily, have a little sweaty/clammy feeling on face.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
3:00	slightly, but noticeably imbalanced. (harder to type, a little extra thought required when walking up or down stairs). Feels a little heavier, mentally. A deeper breath every once in a while. very mild [tactile] sensory enhancement. haven't had music or tv yet. going to lie down.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
3:10	the weight of this makes me consider whether or not I'm approaching a +2. <BR>
<BR>
3:15	needed a blanket, hard to decide if I'm hot or cold. still, craving a hot shower. I just might take one.<BR>
<BR>
3:20	muscles a bit sore. jaw and arm. shower is calling. turned off AC for fear of cold-shock on way back. Wow,   the lack of noise from that thing is nice! motor skills noticeably impaired now. like drinking 2 or 3 alcohol drinks.  pupils are responsive. dilation minimal. <BR>
<BR>
3:35	+3 I'd be a fool to try and ignore this! The shower was REALLY GREAT for first 10 mins. Then, it tapers off a little. I must do this with a girl next time. -lots of soapy water and lots of touching all over! Feels divine! got a little teeth-grind at this stage, too. -I can wish it away.<BR>
<BR>
3:40 	I can't take it anymore! porn city.<BR>
<BR>
3:50	an unbelievable experience. a little thirsty now.<BR>
<BR>
3:55	feels like a plateau. going to ride it through with a small burger and a cig. pupils responsive and dilation is minimal. I'm definitely buzzing, but I can type and put stuff in the microwave and eat with no problems.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
4:15	quite coherent. feels clean. clean means if I wanted to just try and 'sleep it off', I could do so without laying there in misery. -been there before with bad 'e', that's how I know.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
4:16	took 3 mg more. attempting cannabis soon. now I understand what 'tryptamine feel' means. cannabis complements this kind of PLATEAU. I must've consumed cousins of this drug before. There's no point in peaking on both at the same time unless utter incoherence is your wish. <BR>
<BR>
4:20	After-thoughts, referencing earlier.<BR>
* the soreness lasted only 10 mins or so and vanished without notice.<BR>
* not once did I feel nausea or actually vomit. if it weren't for my mind trying to conceive every possible thing to write down, I'd never have thought to mention it!<BR>
* had 16 oz. [or little less] of fluid plus that burger since we started.<BR>
<BR>
4:25	first hints of being jittery. -only a tiny hint, like coffee. it's ten mins since last dose. maybe that's why. given the nature of this drug so far, I don't expect it to last.<BR>
<BR>
4:30 I licked the knife to get an extra mg or two.<BR>
<BR>
4:35	noticing teeth & jaw muscles again. no problem, though. getting curious about that smoke.<BR>
<BR>
4:39	ok, getting it now.<BR>
<BR>
4:45 lighting up now..<BR>
<BR>
515 2 unforgettable spanks and wowwww.. time for WinAmp visualizations.<BR>
<BR>
6:11 orgasms aside, let's just say I've been to the top a number of times. nite nite.<BR>
<BR>
635 darvocet<BR>
640 must've taken too much moxy. on the verge of freakout at times. <BR>
<BR>
645 topographical slides are my hallucinations<BR>
<BR>
650 just realized that this drug is like a blade. if I lean on it too hard, I bleed. I'm bleeding pretty bad.<BR>
<BR>
653 feel a little better, strangely. <BR>
<BR>
657 bearable now<BR>
658 I take that back. almost cried like a little girl a minute ago<BR>
659 wishing this would end.<BR>
700 in an attempt to preserve sanity, will put head to bed in silence.<BR>
<BR>
709 bed doesnt work. morphine now. I have a drug problem.<BR>
pain, guilt tears coming. I can see. thank god nobody knows.<BR>
for this, I honestly believe that I deserve to die.<BR>
<BR>
714 trying bed again<BR>
727 hurting badly. cig now<BR>
733 going for a walk. activity is soothing. rest turns into disrest. I am not at liberty to describe the deeply personal and religious thoughts I've had. They're pretty bad.<BR>
<BR>
806 more morph, feeling better. walking helps. <BR>
<BR>
851 back from walking. still really fucked. thoughts that would shame my mother while walking. half a xanax now.<BR>
<BR>
909 I feel *noticeably* better. taking the other half of xanax now. (.5mg tabs)<BR>
will lay in bed for a while. no music.<BR>
<BR>
919 I would rather die a physically horrible death than go through this again.<BR>
<BR>
933 I just realized that my name was Dan. now, it's Danny.<BR>
<BR>
939 yes, I never thought this would happen to me. <BR>
<BR>
948 as far as I'm concerned, you all can pot-smoke, coke-sniff, and extacy pill your brains out. DON'T EVER TAKE THIS SHIT<BR>
<BR>
957 finally feel sane. yeah, more morphine now. btw, I've been avoiding alcohol.<BR>
yes, there is a religious thing 'going on' with using booze to heal pain. as a morphine addict (oral only, never IV) alcohol is [usually] essential for my stimulus. I think I may give-in soon. before, (when bleeding mentally) I was afraid of what it might do to me. now, I think it would just be like normal. -make me tired and numb.<BR>
<BR>
10:13 god damn this shit is sad. I've read through it a few times and believe me, you missed the part where every line in between read 'Jesus Christ is this hell'<BR>
<BR>
10:15 I actually feel well enough to go for *another* walk outside. This time, it will be with vodka & sprite or coke -whatever's in the fridge to collect my thoughts about why the fuck [a million emotions surge] 1.) this happened 2.) it had to be so BAD. 3.) why nobody told me. <BR>
<BR>
I finally understand all those 'parents' that cry and scream about taking this shit off the streets. I have no kids, but would let them do almost anything (weed, code & e), as I have done before, except THIS. <BR>
<BR>
btw, the hallucinations stopped around the time of my 2nd half-tab of xanax.<BR>
<BR>
going for a walk now. 10:25<BR>
<BR>
10:38 got caught up with my roommate in some landlord politics. new fridge coming, apparently. I feel really good now. no booze yet, but going to sip it slowly in a min and see if I can bring a smile to today's -ahem. about the stuff before regarding misery, bleeding mentally and whatnot. it's all true. <BR>
<BR>
11:12 ok, 2nd slug of vodka is coming right up. considering what's in my system now, it's safe to assume that everything's gonna be ok. <BR>
<BR>
I think that tryptamines are the kind of drugs I wouldn't give to my worst enemy *or* my lover (the latter, I had been thinking the whole time). Extacy/MDMA, cocaine, and pot are childs-play, in my opinion, cause I've done them for years. Today, it was 5-MeO MIPT.<!--   End Body   -->

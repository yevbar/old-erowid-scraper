I'm going to start off with a background of my drug experience. I've been smoking pot for the last 2 years or so, and I've done ecstacy 5 times, done acid 3 times, and done DXM once before the following experience. <BR>
<BR>
The first time, I had a good trip, or 'swirl' as my friends like to call the effects of DXM.  I took 15 [Coricidin Cold & Cough] the first time, and felt fine, and had a good time. I expected this time to be much the same.<BR>
<BR>
I was on a full stomach, and feeling a bit upset to my stomach as well, and I took the 12 caps, all at once, around 4:30 PM. I was with a couple of my friends, J and R, and my girlfriend, B.  We were all at B's house, and hers was already kicking in, having been taken about an hour earlier.  She was tripping nicely at this point, and in a very good mood. <BR>
<BR>
Before mine kicked in, J and R had B convinced that World War III was happening, and that we all need to get to shelter. I told her, though, that everything was ok, and that we weren't at war, nor are we going to die.  Mine still had not taken affect at this point. It was around 5:30<BR>
<BR>
Mine didn't kick in until about 2 hours after I took it, around 6:30.  I was in the bathroom, washing my hands, and all of a sudden, I looked up at the mirror, and the room was spinning, and my reflection was deep in the mirror, at the end of what looked like a long hall in the mirror.  I went back out, into B's kitchen, and got a notebook which was lying on the counter. B and I went outside to smoke a cigarette, as I wrote. By this time, I was just feeling very depressed, and I felt as if I was doing something horrible, and unforgivable, and this made me an equally horrible person. I wrote an entire page on this theme. <BR>
<BR>
We both, then, went back up to her room, as R and J went on the internet in the next room.  I read to her what I had written, and she got very scared for me.  It was just evidence that I was very depressed; nothing really bad.  <BR>
<BR>
After this, at about 8:00, R and J decided they wanted to go drive and get some pot.  We drove, and B and I sat in the back seat, and I just stared out the window, unable to feel anything. The world went by, and there seemed to be nothing I could do to make any difference in any of it. It was like I was in a dream, and I would soon wake up, with nothing changed.  I couldn't feel a thing, physically, or emotionally. B was getting concerned, and scared for my well being, as I wouldn't say a word, except that I was ok, and that I would explain everything I was feeling to her later. <BR>
<BR>
After we got back, at around 9:00, I still couldn't feel anything, and it didn't even seem like B and I were together. It felt like we were semi-good friends. We are normally an extremely affectionate couple. Soon, she went to her room, to listen to music, and I tried to help J write an email to his girlfriend. Trying to do this was the most difficult task I've ever attempted. I could not hit the correct key, no matter how hard I tried. My coordination was completely gone. I soon gave up, and decided to go check on B, to see if she was ok. I found her sitting in her closet, listening to Staind, crying. She was angry, sad, and empty. Almost as empty as me. She began to alternate between utter rage, and nothingness. <BR>
<BR>
We both went back to the computer room, having difficulty walking down the hall, but we eventually made it. We got there, and, until about 10:15, we just touched each other's arms, and tried to feel again. It was awful. The presence of her fingers was evident, but it couldn't be described as good or bad. I was just empty, and emotionless. It was a strain to even smile.<BR>
<BR>
I finally started to come down around 10:30, when I had to leave, to go back home. I actually started to feel extraordinarily good, and relaxed. It was more like this the first time, a week and a half before, when I tried DXM for the first time. I got home, and fell asleep quickly, listening to Christopher Lawrence, a trance DJ I like alot. <BR>
<BR>
The day after, I woke up feeling very uncomfortable, shaking, and unable to eat. It was very scary, but I made it through quite okay. I went back to hang out with, and to talk about the previous day with the same people I was with the day before.<BR>
<BR>
I wouldn't necessarily reccomend this to anyone, who has trouble with drastic after-effects the morning after. Also, if you do decide to take this drug, make sure youre very healthy when you do, and make sure you stay in a good mind set before and during the trip. DONNOT TAKE ON A FULL STOMACH!<!--   End Body   -->

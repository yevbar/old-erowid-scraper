OK this is it. Back in 87 some idiot I was climbing with was above me not tied in well. Although I told him how to tie in where there would never even be a chance to fall he didnt listen and fell 25 ft. landing on my head blowing out 3 discs in my neck and causing many bone spurs to develop since. So since then I,ve gone from vicoden to 5 vicoprophine 750s and 3 20 mgs. of oxycotin a day, along with as much herion I could get my hands on to smoke. <br>
<br>
I,ve known of ibogaine since 1969 but never knew it cured addiction. so I decided to take a lil trip below the border to detox with ibogaine. The dr. that gave me this sacred medcine let made me wait tell all the drugs cleared my sytstem for the ibogaine to have clear brain recepters. I went into withdrawl waiting for my first dose. God damn oxycotin! the absolute worse withdrawl ever I twitched, spazzed went hot cold sweats moaned cryed shaked. You name it everything I ever heard of withdrawl I went through. And oh yeah the one we junkies dont like to mention, shit my pants a bunch. <br>
<br>
The people at the ibogaine center were full of pure love no tough love(thank god) I hurt enough already. They were absolute servents to my needs yet would not give me any of my pain killers back. The ibogaine eased the withdrawl remarkably although I was still in withdrawl. The dr. kept saying the worse is over your going to be thanking me they all do you will soon be reborn. He was right! it took a few days and a few doses but I recovered. the visions I had were beautiful.  Anyone whos ever done phycodellics knows the colors beyond the rainbow they bring on and so many faces cats, tigers, loved ones reminding me I had a life out there that was about to start a new begining. I like Leary see no reason for any drug to be illegal (espacally in plant form) in the land of the so called free.  Ibogaine has a defferent place in the world of sacred sacramental medicine............peace.<!--   End Body   -->

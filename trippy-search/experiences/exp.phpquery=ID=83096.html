<!--   Start Body   -->


I just had my first full ecstasy experience, and it was something I wanted to share. I had tried it once five years ago, I had sniffed half a blue pill with a dolphin icon, and felt the effects, but the experience wasn't what I classified as fully rolling. Now I am an experienced psychonaut, I've done nearly every other substance, but I was always reluctant to try E because of what I saw it do to my friends in the past. I always noticed that Ecstasy lowered peoples intelligence more than other drugs. So I steered clear and mainly stuck with herb and mushrooms.<br>
<br>
Well I decided to try some for 2010 New Years, and earlier that day I did some research on the interactions of MDMA with Amphetamine. However I did not do MDMA and Amphetamine at the same time, I waited 12 hours between the two. Well here's the method I used for a great experience:<br>
<br>
6:30 am- 50 MG Adderall XR, 10 MG Adderall IR<br>
<br>
6:00 pm- I preloaded with: 500 MG 5-HTP, 600 MG N-Acetyl L-Tyrosine, 1000 MG Vitamin C, 800 MG Piracetam (I've found it increases the effects of psychedelics and stimulants).<br>
<br>
8:30 pm- My wife and I swallowed 150 MG of MD(M)A, a yellow pill with a pistol icon on it.<br>
<br>
9:00 pm- Very subtle but noticable increase in light intensity.<br>
<br>
9:15 pm- slight change in color appreciation, slight bouncy feeling.<br>
<br>
9:45 pm- effects increase with a discernable body high take hold.<br>
<br>
10:00 pm- I am confident that the pills we took were good at this point, I was concerned that the pills might have been just a mix of other drugs, but I could tell you this was far different than any combo of opiates, stimulants, or psychedelics I've had. <br>
<br>
10:15 pm- My wife suggests we smoke some spice. As with most of my psychedelic experiences, the cannabanoids really helped usher us completly into the experience. <br>
<br>
10:20 pm- I see many visual changes. It was a wavy, smooth, organic ebb and flow similar to mushrooms, only it was less apparent. The body high was absolutly amazing, on par to what I was expecting. It felt like extensions of myself that far extended my physical body were being massaged. Kinda similar to Meth or regular Amphetamines, but way different too. The tweaked out feeling was not felt at all, in fact the stimulation other than the body high was not speedy at all. I was not up or down. I was just in the middle, but really high and happy. The mental changes were very noticable, again like a very low dose shrooms. It was very manageable, and I felt in control the whole night.<br>
<br>
10:45 pm- My wife and I stared at a trippy poster I have with stoner/shroomer elves. The elves and forest were mesmerizing. We stared at the for half an hour, with new characters and items that kept popping out of the background and forest. 'I feel so f*@#ing good', I couldn't help but say a few times thoughout the night.<br>
<br>
11:30 pm- I had no control over conversational subject matters. I would constantly make connections between subjects that aren't normally associated. I remember an example, somehow I thought of the word clavicle. My buddy had stopped by and I said something like 'The word clavicle sounds like some kind of gremlin from Dragon Ball Z. 'Burn him in Ice Clavicle!!!'' Somehow this was so funny that when I said this my wife, my buddy, and myself literally fell to the floor with uncontrollable laughter. I believe I am on the climax of the experience.<br>
<br>
11:55 pm- We controlled our laughing long enough so we could watch the ball drop.<br>
<br>
12:00 am - Happy New Year. I feel like this year is gonna be amazing.<br>
<br>
12:15 am- The three of us went upstairs to my den, and my friend DJ'ed for me and my wife while we all smoked spice and chilled in the blacklight. <br>
<br>
12:45 am- When I went outside to smoke a cigarette (yes I broke my new years resolution that quick), and felt the need to talk to neighbors that I normally never talk to. For some reason I felt the need to warn them about drinking and driving as if they didnt know the dangers. My wife went to bed, just to lay there and think.<br>
<br>
1:15 am- My daughter woke up, and I put a childrens movie on for her, she is approx one year, so she talks but its 75% baby talk 25% real words. It seemed as if she could sense the state I was in, and that she was acting different, as if she was feeling the same way. I became very concerned that somehow the E had came out my pores and that somehow she absorbed this through her skin and even though this must be a very small dose, for her age and weight it might be roughly equivalent to my dose. So I took her temp just to make sure this wasn't the case. I was just trippin.<br>
<br>
1:45 am- I put my daughter back to bed and went to program some music in my studio. My friend was in there and we jammed. I didn't get mad that he single handedly drank my unopened 20 pack of beer without asking. He was starting to get sloppy drunk, so we just started 'youtubing' (taking turns picking vids on youtube). C-Lo's 'getting grown' was my pick for the night that best summarized my experience.<br>
<br>
2:15 am- I fear that I am overheating when I tr to go to bed, but it turns out I left the heater on too high. I smoke some spice and lay down in bed next to my wife. She's awake still, she tells me she is still studying the poster from earlier in her mind. Which I had experienced too, a more photographic memory to art, but with a hallucinogenic imprint, the organic flow is still imprinted and stayed imprinted like that well into the next day, especially when I smoked spice.<br>
<br>
4:00 am- I go to bed still feeling the ecstasy, the very slow come down was not that noticable.<br>
<br>
The next day my wife and I post loaded (same doses of 5-HTP, Vitamin C, L-Tyrosine)<br>
<br>
POSTNOTES<br>
<br>
The come down wasn't that bad, it was a lazy day the next day. My wife and I had moderate cramps in our calves, similar to the achiness the day after LSD. We sleep alot throughout the day (Friday). The day after that (Saturday) I was noticable less patient and quick to anger, until I redosed with 5-HTP, Vitamin C, L-Tyrosine. It is now midday saturday and I took another 60 MG of Adderall and the Postloading from E has made the Amphetamines quite a bit stronger.<br>
<br>
CONCLUSION:<br>
This was not a life changing revelation like ayahuasca, it wasn't deep and meaningful like shrooms, it was just pleasure. The mind high is there to change the perception of the body changes, in my opinion. <br>
<br>
All in all this is a very nice substance, but I'm glad I did my homework and waited until I was older, because this is a very easy drug to handle and I can see why people do it again and again. It feels great.<!--   End Body   -->

Having just spent the previous couple of weeks 'researching' the effects of some 2C-I; I decided to bring out the little pile of 5MEO-DMT that I had been sent from an online friend.  Setting was a block from my rented house...  I had no scale and cut up what my friend had told me was 100mg, into five equal looking piles.  Myself and two other psychonauats each toked approx 20mg of the drug.  <br>
<br>
As soon as my buddy exhaled his hit, he sank to his knees, and began mumbling.  Since I knew him to be a fairly experienced entheo user I was somewhat surprised as I watched him fall so far into 'the void' so quickly.  Within 30 seconds of exhaling, he was crying and mumbling to Jesus.  My other friend asked me 'is he all right?'  all I could do was shrug and say 'Hell man, how do I know!!  <br>
<br>
I loaded up the pipe once more and offered it to the other friend.  He took it, inhaled deeply, and immediately laid down on the ground waving his arms, and laughing.  I took my hit and was propelled into hyperspace.  I can surely relate to the comment in Sashas' book where he states that the 5-MEO-DMT effect is one in which a person is without a refrence point in which to judge the drugs effect. I don't remember any colors, or patterns ala acid etc, but I distincly remember being stunned by the intensity of what was going on within my mind.  It was as if I beheld everything going on in the universe instantaneously.  Call it 'cosmic' if you must.  <br>
<br>
I've done every drug under the sun, but this stuff had me 'OUT THERE'  I looked at my two buddies; one laying on the ground laughing, the other on his knees crying, and I was sitting there more or less 'stunned'.  Can't say the stuff is not powerfull, but it really seemed to lack that magic that causes a person to wish to try it again.  There seemed to be no 'spiritual' aspect to the effect; no insightful magic.  the effects faded over a 10-15 period, at which time all of us went indoors and enjoyed a pleasant, highly tactile afterbuzz for approximately another 20 minutes.  I later gave away the rest of the 5MEO-DMT.  Just did not have the cosmic magic I had hoped for.<!--   End Body   -->

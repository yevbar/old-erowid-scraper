Reading through various reports, I quickly notice two opposing stances regarding these substances (for the purposes of this report GHB and 1-4 BDO will be considered virtually interchangable - according to my experience - though there is obviously some controversy on this point). The first, is that many seemingly experienced 'psychonauts' routinely use these substances in conjunction with various entheogens. The other, expressed almost ad nauseum in reports specific only to these substances, is that they are noxious and produce a variety of negative side effects including addiction, withdrawal, and even death (even reports by otherwise relatively objective, sober reporters). It is because of these latter that I now feel compelled to add my humble (or perhaps not so) two cents to the fray.<BR>
<BR>
For the record, I am a 47 year old male, 6'4, 195lb, who regularly enjoys, and has a relatively high tolerance for, alcohol in its various forms. No particular high tolerance for other entheogens, in fact, if anything, a tendency toward lower than average doses (I have generally found that half the 'usual' dose of most substances suits me well). In good health, physically fit, good diet, and take a daily regimen of supplements that include Vitamin C (2-3gm), 5-HTP (100mg every morning, every night), and 7-KETO (50mg). I also go through cycles of daily Piracetam (1600mg) and Hydergine (5 - 10mg) combination.<BR>
<BR>
Over two years ago I first began researching GHB on the Net, and quickly decided to give it a go after coming across a couple of particularly thoughtful sites. I was able to obtain the powder salt form of GHB online (I live a country where it is not yet illegal), and began experimenting. 2gm of the powder dissolved in water turned out to be my optimum dose, and I began to use daily. For me, GHB proved a valuable ally in four key areas, namely Euphoria ('a gentle unclenching of the soul'), Exercise, Sex, and Sleep. Typically I would start the day with 2gm, then around noon dose again before doing my hour exercise routine, and then again 2gm before bedtime. A particularly favorite combination was 2gm of GHB in fresh brewed coffee of a morning.<BR>
<BR>
Exercise: It noticeably increases my ability for prolonged, intense workouts. Due to its muscle relaxant properties, it is also a valuable ally with yoga.<BR>
<BR>
Sex: Although sex while actually on GHB is incredible, I find that in general my sexual performance and capacity are enhanced (though I had not previously been among the Viagra deficit set).<BR>
<BR>
Sleep: Truly like a baby. It's difficult to describe the deep sense of well being upon awaking from a GHB enabled sleep. So deep, in fact, that often I wake up after only 3-4 hours.<BR>
<BR>
Because of my daily use, however, the powder salt form was becoming prohibitively expensive ($120/100gm, you can do the math). I read many reports that 1-4 BDO is a precursor to GHB (upon ingestion it is converted by the body into GHB), so again, obtaining a litre from an online supplier (99% pure 1-4 BDO) almost 2 years ago to the day, I began using 1-4 BDO, in a similar fashion, instead of the powdered GHB. My optimal dose for the BDO was established as 1.5ml. One noticeable difference between GHB and BDO is that the BDO enabled sleep is longer, 5-6 hours. <BR>
<BR>
Contrary to many reports, there has been absolutely no escalation requirement for dose. In fact, for me, GHB and BDO have a fairly strict dosage curve, in that even a small amount over the optimal dose will indeed result in more wooziness than is comfortable. To me it is no wonder that people who are taking several times my optimal dose are making messy floors and walls, and making trips to the hospital. Not to mention people who are buying some colorless liquid at a club and ODing. Of course the maxims 'know thy substance', and 'know thy dose' should prevail, but sadly many people writing the aforementioned reports choose ignorance over 'just say know'. There are no good or bad substances, only appropriate and inappropriate doses. In my experience, food itself, under certain conditions, can become a pretty heavy hit.<BR>
<BR>
In my case, due to extensive work-related travel, I have often gone a week or more without this valuable ally, to no ill effect (though admittedly less restful sleep than usual).<!--   End Body   -->

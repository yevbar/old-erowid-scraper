A friend of mine is taking a bartending course and was eager to test out his new cocktail making skills.  I was eager to be the labrat and so was another friend of mine.  We went to the liquor store and splurged about $50 on liquor (vodka, whiskey, rum), he already had mixers like triple sec, and vermouth at his house.  So we got back to his house and invited a few friends over and started knocking back cocktails.<BR>
<BR>
Now I've been drunk before many times in my life, but usually when I tread into the realms of 14 alcohol units plus, I risk all kinds of misadventures.  Ie. vomitting, hangovers, anger, sadness, saying stupid things, and blacking out, however tonight I managed to drink far more than that and have a really great time, hangover free.<BR>
<BR>
I easily had 20 units of alcohol, about 16 shots of liquor in cocktails, plus 4 beers.  I drank very quickly and recklessly, the alcohol wasn't even kicking in until i was on my sixth cocktail.  And then when I felt I was really drunk, I did the smartest thing.  I stopped drinking.  Usually I'd nurse a bottle of Jack Daniels until I fell asleep and those are the nights I don't enjoy, and wakeup in the worst state.<BR>
<BR>
After I stopped drinking, about an hour and a half after we started, we went for a walk to go get some sandwiches, and it proved to be very fun just to be out and about.  We were out walking and eating for around two hours and when we got back to my friends house we noisily polished off about 3 glasses of water each.  I fell asleep on the floor and woke up at 7am feeling really good, had a pee and a couple more glasses of water and was in a great headspace all day.  I remembered the entire night, and didn't feel guilty about anything.<BR>
<BR>
So, I'm going to try and remember when drinking, to stop when enough's enough and just enjoy the alcohol as opposed to attempting to drink the most alcohol I possibly can.<!--   End Body   -->

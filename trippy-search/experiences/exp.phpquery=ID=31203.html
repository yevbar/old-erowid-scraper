This was perhaps my third time with 2c-t-2 (I say perhaps, because 3 times previously I had tried an unknown white powder that made me halucinate, certainly a 2c-x, but I strongly doubt it was 2c-t-2).  I had previously tried it at dosages of 22 and 26 mg, with strong visuals each time.  <BR>
<BR>
T + 0:00 :Drink a 2mg/mL concentration of 2c-t-2 in vodka.  I drink 16 ml; it tastes strongly chemical, drowning out the vodka flavor.<BR>
<BR>
T + :15: Something is noticed; I have no visuals, but I am certainly altered.  A bowl of high grade pot is smoked to ease the come-up.  <BR>
<BR>
T +:30: Definitely noticing a trip by now.  I feel speedy, as though my muscles are tense.  I feel like I should do something, so I find myself walking around the room, talking.  Words flow with relative ease; not so easy as with cocaine, or mdma, but certainly easier than normal.<BR>
<BR>
T + 1:30: Visuals are definitely noticed by now, with purple Persian rug patterns reported by all who are tripping.  Tracers are prominent.  The speedy feelings persist, and to calm ourselves, me, M, and S decide to talk a walk in a large park near my house.  It is approximately 8 pm, so it is dark.<BR>
<BR>
T + 2:45: When walking in the park, dark color changes are noted even without the presence of light.  Walking is more difficult than usual, but with concentration is not impossible.  I feel as though I have the energy to walk forever, never feeling tired even after climbing steep hills.  Mind alteration is noted besides the pot and the visuals.  There is most definitely a change in my thought process, but it is less introspective than a mushroom or lsd trip.  Attempts at philosophizing only scratched the surface of an idea, whereas with mushrooms I would dig deep until the root was found.  <BR>
<BR>
T + 5:00: Return from walking in the park; visuals are still noted, but on the decrease.  More pot is smoked, and soon after, the visuals become more powerful again.  Pot certainly seems to add to the intensity of this drug.  <BR>
<BR>
T + 6:30: 6 and a half hours after ingesting, and around 5 since coming up, I was able to declare that I was mostly come down.  The trip was very visual; color changes were heavy, especially with purples and greens.  However, it did not offer much insight into my life.  So the trip was fun, but overall, non-productive.<!--   End Body   -->

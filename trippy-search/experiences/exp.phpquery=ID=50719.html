As a long time user of halucinogens, an experience with Amanita Muscaria was way overdue. I came into a batch surfing the net and thought I'd try what was available.<BR>
I started with downing 6g powdered ayahuasca vine mixed with some orange juice for flavor. I couldnt handle the tea, so this was the next best thing. Next came 10g of the finest caps I had ever seen. Beautiful red caps dried to perfection. Munch munch. <BR>
<BR>
I waited about an hour and nothing. So I figured I had been had. Not even a hint of a headchange. I polished off another 10g, and topped it off with some 5x Salvia smoke. About 1/10g. Slowly inhaled the fine, not so harsh smoke, letting it fill my lungs with its aroma. Exhale. Being this was the first time for me, I wanted my experience to be awesome, without regret. I lay the pipe in the ashtray and my mind said no, yet my body said, yes. A feeling of euphoria washed over me. A tingling effect in my eyes. I tried to control the emotion, yet it was uncontrollable. I was completely engulfed in an unknowing state, yet, it was awesome. My total experience was about 10 minutes, yet I hadnt watched the clock so it could have been shorter/longer. A plateau effect had arrived and the 'high' leveled into a state of mind rather than an uncontrolled stupor. It was nice and I was part of it now. I walked the house waiting for the next 'phase'. I thought I had felt a little something yet I couldnt describe what it was, maybe the salvia still working its magic, or the ayahuasca, or maybe the shrooms... I didnt know. <BR>
<BR>
I lay down long enough for my stomach to settle. And fall asleep. Dreams, livid realistic dreams ensue. Dreams of friends asking for help, and I am their hero. Dreams so vivid in colors and shapes. I awake. I feel like I am in a tunnel, or a series of tunnels connecting to one central place, that place being my body. I cannot move without following the tunnel. Any movement outside the tunnel and my body convulses. I have a feeling in my stomach, yet it is almost nonexistent. Waves of color. Feelings of monumental proportions. This is like no other high I have ever before experienced. I lay back down after a short period of time and close my eyes. Waves and waves of color exploding into my every thought. Tranquility. Peace. Thoughts of anything are not there, I cannot think. I can only Let my mind do its own thing. It is its own. It cannot be controlled, yet, I dont want to control it. The feelings are too real, the experience whole and wholesome. Still reeling with closed eyes, I never again wish to open. Mumble mumble, I try to speak to my wife who is not 'tripping', yet she cant hear me, or she wishes not to respond. Oh well, I dont need the negativity anyway. <BR>
<BR>
I am just so positive thinking and my mind reels and my heart so light in beating and my limbs limp and my head wandering into a land where everything is so awesome and great, and.......... Silenced thoughts. Everything stopped for some time. I was able to think for myself again, my every thought manufactured by me. I rose from the state I had been in and wondered what had happened. My stomach a little queasy, yet not 'hurting' to any extent. I drank some water and felt it go down. I felt the water travel down my throat, into my small intestines, following it as it goes. Right into my stomach the cool liquid stopped. I figured on making myself something to eat, as I had not known how long I had been without sustenance. Cereal and milk. I ate a whole bowl. Finished it off with some more water. I return to my bed and lay down to watch some television. I still had a head trip, yet it was so non-formal. Flip, Flip, Flip through the channels. From this point, I cannot tell you exactly what was watched on television, all I know is this... Everything was warped and hilariously entertaining. <BR>
<BR>
After a while of this, I closed my eyes and drifted into another visionary trance. Everything seemed to be mocking my every move. I try to enhance the feeling by moving more and it goes away. So I lay still, eyes shut. Everything, EVERYTHING seemingly moved by thought. Then as fast as it had come on, it left. I fell asleep. When I awoke this morning, a feeling washed over me if just for a second. A feeling of sadness that the trip had ended. I ate, and drank and felt fine. I had not even experienced the usual next day 'squirts' from previous shroom trips. No headache, no next morning tiredness. Still yet I feel head trippy like a small hangover, yet even it is almost non-existent. All in all, the whole trip was eventful, yet not what expected in the same breath. <BR>
<BR>
In afterthought, if asked to do it all over again, I would. Just not today, or tommorrow. Maybe next week. As rememberance to the Salvia trip. The salvia took me to a place never before experienced. I lost all control over my functions and if people think this is fun, then so be it. Not for me, thanks.<!--   End Body   -->

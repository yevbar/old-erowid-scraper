I'm writing this because I think people are misinformed about morning glory.<br>
 <br>
For my first morning glory experience, I had tried using the water/alcohol extraction technique described in the FAQ.  This process was a lot of work and very slow.  The materials for the extraction (viz. Everclear) cost more than the MG seeds!  The extraction was not particularly efficient – about 35%.  It did provide a very clean, wonderful experience.  It was like being stoned out of my mind, and it let my inner child run free in a very special way.  I wrote about this is a previous experience report (“Letting my inner child out to play”).  I should also note that my present experience confirms the accuracy of my extraction efficiency estimate.<br>
 <br>
This time (my second MG experience), I used a method that I refer to as 'soak and squeeze'.  It was quick and easy, and this method gave me a transcendental experience!!!  All I had to do is obtain some untreated morning glory seeds (I used Heavenly Blue), put the seeds in water for a day and a half, then remove the seeds from the water and squeeze them.  The light beige insides slip right out of the seed coat.  The seed coat consists of the dark blue 'shell' that is attached to a sticky, oily clear membrane.  I made sure all of that was removed.  I discarded the seed coat, and rinsed the seeds thoroughly.  I was preparing two batches of 350 seeds (i.e., a total of 700 seeds), and about 50 seeds in each batch (the smallest, darkest ones) did not open and were discarded.<br>
<br>
What remained of the two batches (each batch was about 3 teaspoonfuls) was put in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  This amount of seeds fit nicely in the sandwich.  The seeds did not taste like anything at all, and had a texture like crunchy peanut butter.  The process might sound tedious, but it really wasn't.  It was fun in a 'Zen' kind of way.  The imagery of the dark seed coat and light insides with their “noodle-like” texture came-up during the trip.  I did the two batches by myself in a total of less than an hour-and-a-half start to finish.<br>
 <br>
My best friend and I had our PBJ&MG 'psychedelic sandwiches' at 12 pm noon on a beautiful spring day.  We were in the country, surrounded by the forest.  I am in my early 30’s and my friend is in his middle 50’s.  We are both of average build, around 80 kg and 75 kg, respectively.  We had had one MG experience together before, lots of salvia experiences together, and he has had a lot of experience with peyote, mushrooms, and LSD.  We were both eager, because our last MG experience had been so positive, but were a bit nervous because we had never tried the 'soak and squeeze' method.  The effects started surprisingly fast, in about 15 minutes.  This MG feeling kept slowly building.  It was somewhere between being drunk and being stoned (a little less clean feeling than with the extraction, which was more like being stoned).  Our stomachs felt somewhat uncomfortable - not bad, but not good either – certainly nowhere near sick or vomiting.  There was some tingling and heaviness in our limbs and faces (which we didn’t really get with the water/alcohol extraction).<br>
 <br>
I had a lot of the crazy imagination (“inner child running free”) that I experienced on my last morning glory trip, but the intensity was higher, almost to the point of being unpleasant.  In particular, a light hanging from the ceiling was swinging back and forth in my imagination with a “ding-dong” sound.  Periodically, it would go up and down with a slide-whistle sound.  Shut-up god damn it!<br>
 <br>
We were in this state for the first three hours.  We were beginning to get discouraged - if we had wanted to feel drunk, we would have gotten drunk.  It felt like things wanted to 'take off', but just couldn't quite get there.  At 3pm, we decided to make some coca tea.  Coordination and balance were difficult, but we made the tea.  The tea helped our stomachs to feel better (which is why we made it).  At that time, our experience moved onto another plateau.  I'm not sure if the tea did it; supposedly the tea has been decocanized.  We both began to get visual disturbances.  Peripheral vision things for both of us, and I got things turning colors a little bit.  It felt like there was a little elf in my mind turning a screw-driver on my “green” color receptors.  This is as visual as the trip would be.<br>
 <br>
Then we laid in bed and talked.  In our experiences, morning glory is a very 'mental' drug (as opposed to “visual” or “body” drug).  We had the most amazing conversation.  We started by talking about how funny it was that dinosaurs used to rule the earth, and now we are pumping them out of the earth (petroleum) to make plastic shopping bags, which are slowly taking over the world.  We wondered about where all the soul energy is coming from for the explosion in the human population.  We speculated about the dinosaur’s souls and our reptile brain.  We talked about reproduction, penises and vaginas; and about resources, petroleum and water … how funny it is that we put water into plastic bottles.  We thought that the future was a silly thing to worry about, because we live in the present.  We figured that if you could make “now” perfect, then it would be that perfect moment forever.  All the while, there was this feeling that things were wrapping themselves and folding upon each other – constantly and continually.  Little did I know, that I would soon experience the perfect, infinite moment...<br>
 <br>
We went out side.  God!  It is so beautiful!  I could feel that the trip was moving up to yet another plateau.  I laid down in the grass, while my friend was off doing something else, and then it happened!  I was looking up through a fern at light coming down through pine needles - all of these lines and branching and light and shadow, the musty smell of the forest floor soaking into me.  I thought, I could die right now and this would be perfect.  I can't describe what happened next.  It was a transcendent moment.  Time went infinite and looped back onto itself.  Suddenly it occurred to me that I might be dead, and I might be laying here in heaven.  This was the perfect moment.  It was heaven, nirvana.<br>
 <br>
It is so hard for me to even put words to this.  I’ve never been at such a loss for words in my life.  To make a long story short, I made the choice not to be dead, but to embrace life.  I can accept the pain in life because I can see the beauty.  My experience in the grass was so beautiful that it hurt, but there was also an element of terror to it.<br>
 <br>
Thinking about my experience the next day, two images come to mind.  The first is a spring releasing and going 'boing'.  This is basically what happened to time.  The second image is of some guy in a little booth in India.  He asked for my book (of life).  He takes a stamp and stamps this image of the fern and tree on every single page of my book.  Everywhere I go in my memory; there I am lying under the tree.<br>
 <br>
I feel like I've been there before.  I feel like this experience re-wrote time. Everything has changed.  When I first discovered salvia (which was my first experience with psychedelic substances), it 'blew the lid' off of my world.  This morning glory trip 'blew the lid' off of 'blowing the lid'.  It was 'blowing the lid' to the 'blowing the lid' power.<br>
 <br>
I think this transcendental experience happened sometime around 5:30 pm.  This was certainly the peak of the experience.  The morning glory experience has a plateau-like quality, and as I moved to different planes of reality I kept thinking that I had peaked, but this experience in the grass was 'It'!<br>
 <br>
From say 6-9 pm, I was dealing with this 'infinite loop' feeling, and there was also a lot of out-of-body feeling.  Sometimes there was some fear, even paranoia (about dying and about going insane).  I should note that morning glory impairs your motor functions like if you were really drunk, and if you are not careful you could really hurt yourself.  Also, I couldn’t really remember what I had said or done from one moment to the next.<br>
 <br>
We were still mildly tripping when we went to bed around midnight (as evidenced by our gigantic pupils!).  I had some minor 'laser light show' visual effects in the dark room.  I didn't sleep much that night.  My friend slept well.  I woke-up with the sunrise and laid in bed listening to the birds.  It was so beautiful that it made me cry.  If I take morning glory in the future I would probably take it a little bit earlier in the day – say 9 to 10 AM – because of how long the trip lasts (and because the first three hours were mostly uneventful).<br>
 <br>
I'm not sure what I was looking for when I got interested in psychedelic drugs, but I can tell you that after this morning glory trip, I found “It”!  It was not what I expected.  I expected the heavens to open up, and to melt into the universe (sort of like salvia, or what my friend describes with LSD).  Morning glory really is a 'personal' drug.  It can take the normal moment, and magnify it to the infinite.  The fact that morning glory does not have visual stuff, just mind stuff, keeps it very personal too.  My friend says that although morning glory is not visual, the experience itself is a lot like an acid trip.  I’m not sure if my experience of heaven is what Herb Caen meant when he talked about going to “morning glory heaven”, but I’m so glad I had my experience.  I don’t think my life will be the same.<br>
 <br>
I’m not sure if the coca tea was necessary to get the trip off the ground, or if that would have happened anyway.  If it is essential, I’m not sure if other substances (e.g., alcohol, nicotine, MJ, caffeine; or god forbid salvia!) would help achieve lift-off.  In any event, coca tea is delicious and soothing, and I would recommend its use in general.<br>
 <br>
I suppose I will take morning glory sometime in the future, but I’m in no hurry.  I really can’t imagine that my life has room for another experience that powerful!<!--   End Body   -->

I am now almost 21 and for the past three years have been on a rollercoaster of recreational drug use. At first it started with drinking and smoking, then it turned into mushrooms, 2c-e, and other research chemicals I could come across. Then I was introduced to cocaine. Cocaine plagued my life for a couple of years on and off, occasionally quitting to enter into a rolling(E) spree one summer.  I eventually found the high to be not as good, and found more negative effects than positive.  At this time my girlfriend was doing the same amount of drugs I was doing.<br>
<br>
Starting in high school I had always liked vicodin and pain killers, but could never find a reliable source so it never was a often thing, but in my second year of college I ended up trying oxy and found a good source. At first my girlfriend wouldn't do it, but she eventually tried it and loved it and got on board. At first an 80 mg could be cut into 8 different lines and would send us off into heaven. One 10 mg line would make me nod off into a blanket of utter warmness and calm.  Soon after doing it a couple times a week for awhile the tolerance built up.  After three months of doing it a few times a week or more we were up to 30-40 mg lines. The high was still amazing, but more money was needed to obtain it, which is the start of the downward spiral.<br>
<br>
During that time I also had a friend who was able to obtain good H. I was unsure whether I wanted to do it since its been so demonized by everyone all my life, but gave it a try anyway.  I enjoyed it alot but was definetely comaprable to oc's high, so more often I stuck with oxy. At the time of the three month mark, I went away for a couple of weeks for a family vacation.  Not thinking, I brought nothing with me, even weed.  All I could think about was the next time I could get oc or if anyone where I was vacationing at had some.  It was quite bothersome more than anything.  I just needed to feel high.  I had to take a few sleeping pills everynight and drink in the evening to  ease the discomfort I was having.  The craziest thing was the dreams.  Every night I would have a different kind of dream all revolving around oxy or heroin.<br>
 <br>
When I got back I was able to go back to the usual routine of buying it everyday. During most of this time I was without a job and luckily had the one of the greatest girlfriends a guy could ask for, most of the time paying for it all. And all the weed.<br>
In a week I would say we would go through 10 80's and 2 1/8ths of ganja. When we were unable to obtain oc we would usual resort to getting real high off weed, or go to some of the prescriptions we were able to obtain.  For a while I was having chest pain, not really bad, but in need of pain killers I played it out to be excruciating so I was being prescribed vicoprofen.  It is a little stonger than vicodin, but still took about 6 or 7 to get a real high off them for me.  So those went fast and when I was out of them my girlfriend had prescriptions for benzodiazepines, cyclobenzaprine, and ambien. When it was dry with oc we would rely on those to help diminish any chance of withdrawals and it seems to work well so far.<br>
<br>
Now it has been over 6 months of doing oc pretty much everyday, or every other, and the tolerance levels of around 40 mg at a time. I still will never reach the truly nod off high I experienced the first few times, but it still is amazing.  Oxy is defintely my drug of choice. I had my time with uppers and they have no appeal to me anymore.  From an outsiders perspective me and my girlfriend look real healthy, are doing well in school, both have jobs, and have great realtionships with our families, and even most of our friends don't know we have anything to do with oxy or h, which I am greatful for.<!--   End Body   -->

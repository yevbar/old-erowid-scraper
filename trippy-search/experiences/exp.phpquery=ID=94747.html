<!--   Start Body   -->


Ever since my first marijuana experience at 17, trying every drug became one of the items on my bucket list. It has been 20 months since then and so far I have done salvia, shrooms, lsd, mdma, 25i-nbome, meth, coke, mdpv, lorazepam, and hydrocodone. The only drug I have done consistently (more than 3 times) is marijuana. I came across MXE when my dealer offered it as a free sample. After a lot of research on several websites, I was ready.<br>
<br>
0:00 - After measuring out 20mg, I wet my finger tips, scoop up the pile, and apply it sublingually. It tastes very salty.<br>
<br>
0:05 - My mouth starts to fill with saliva. It starts to feel uncomfortable - I'll insufflate from now on.<br>
<br>
0:10 - Nothing noticeable yet, but the saliva build up proves itself to be annoying so I swallow.<br>
<br>
0:30 - After 30 minutes, a feeling of drunkenness is unmistakeable. I try to walk around my house but it feels like I just took 5 shots of liquor. I notice that I'm hungry despite only eating a meal a couple hours earlier. I go downstairs and cook up some ramen. Oddly, it was somewhat difficult preparing such an easy meal.<br>
<br>
0:50 - The ramen tasted better than it usually did. I'm a little disappointed with the trip's strength so I redose with another 20mg (insufflated this time). Note - I almost NEVER redose. This is quite uncharacteristic of me and my health is usually a big concern of mines whenever I do drugs. I refuse to do any drugs more than twice a week including alcohol and caffeine. The only exception I have is cannabis.<br>
<br>
1:10 - The redose hits me. I'm feeling really heavy and happy at this point. All the worries in my life drifted away. I felt extremely content. Funnily enough, a feeling of motivation waves over me. I run a website that I've been trying to make part time money off of and suddenly I felt like writing more articles.<br>
<br>
1:15 - I decide to smoke a bowl from my huge bong (2 feet tall). I haven't smoked since classes started 2 weeks ago so today was the day to treat myself. It's been a long week.<br>
<br>
1:25 - My friend's homegrown Jack Herrer mixes with the mxe. Wow, the feelings from the cannabis and mxe were clearly differentiable. This felt like the first time I had ever smoked pot.<br>
<br>
1:40 - Movies and games drew me in, but I felt like I was wasting my trip on them. I lay down on my bed and close my eyes.<br>
<br>
1:55 - HOLY SHIT. I can't come up with words to describe the CEVs and how AWESOME I felt. It surpassed any other drugs that I've experimented with in the past. 100mg of MDMA doesn't come close, LSD was a joke compared to the psychedelic mindset I was in. <br>
<br>
At the time, I put my hand up to my chest to check my heart rate. This is something I always do with new drugs. I can't read my heart rate at all and I get a little anxious about it. One side of me was worried with my health and the other side was enjoying the trip. Note - I've never taken more than 1.5 blotters (prob 120ug) of LSD.<br>
<br>
2:10 - My mind was blown when I looked over at the clock and only 15 minutes had passed. I had been thinking at the speed of light. My 'consciousness' felt disconnected from all my body parts except from the warmth coming from my blankets. I was so far away from my body... like being blasted hundreds of miles up into the cosmos. At the same time, however, I could move my body. It just felt like very tiny body parts. While I was thinking, I couldn't even comprehend why anybody could ever feel sad. The universe was so beautiful and I felt great being alive.<br>
<br>
2:20 - I probably plateau'd at this time.<br>
<br>
2:50 ~ 3:30 - Sometime at this point I pulled up my laptop and posted on a forum I frequent about how great I was feeling.<br>
<br>
3:30 - The trip wasn't as strong anymore. The weed has mostly worn off and I was back to feeling the mxe again. I am now able to get back on my computer.<br>
<br>
5:00 - Mostly sober, but I still felt slightly disconnected.<br>
<br>
From now on, I'll either have a trip sitter or at least a heart watch so I don't have to worry about that anymore. Also, I'll probably keep my dosing to once a month. I've found some concerning health effects with dissociatives.<!--   End Body   -->

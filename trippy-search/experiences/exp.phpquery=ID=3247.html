All I had done before this day was pot, and not much pot at that.  This experience was a really mind blower.<BR>
<BR>
I wake up at 1:30pm to get ready to make my trek to an outdoor rave.  This was to be my first rave and I was hoping it would be a good one.  The rave was located on a farm outside of the city which posed a problem.  I had no way of getting there.  I decided to try and hitchhike.  As I walked along the highway it started to rain, and wouldn't you know it, hail.  It was a cold October afternoon in Toronto making the trek not fun at all.  I walked for about 2 hours before getting picked up.  When I did get picked up my feet were wet and cold, something that would haunt me for the rest of the night.  It turned out that the guy who picked me up lived right by the farm and new the owner, so he offered to drive me right up to the gate.  This was great.<BR>
<BR>
I went into the barn where the main party was going to take place, and looked around.  There were multipule levels made out of hay, and it all looked very cozy.  Nice place for a party, but it was cold.  I went up to one of the top levels where some people were sitting.  They invited me to join them and I did.  We sat there under a blanket for about 3 hours untill the party was getting under way.  <BR>
<BR>
The party started and I was having an OK time, but not great.  I was never one for dancing, mostly because I'm self concious about myself.  I decided to ask my newfound friends if anyone could get me some LSD.  No luck.  One of my newfound friends came up to my later in the night and said his friend that just arrived had some Extasy and asked if I wanted that instead.  I said sure, as I have been researching E and wanted to try it anyways.<BR>
<BR>
He got me my pill around 11:30 and I quickly ingested it with some Pepsi to wash it down.  It had an acrid taste to it that was slightly unpleasent, but withstandable.  I went outside to stand by the fire to wait for the effects to come on.  I didn't know how long this would take, and was getting a little anxious after about 15 minutes.  By now it had finally mostely stopped raining.<BR>
<BR>
I went back inside the barn to sit up on the couch where we were all originally sitting to wait there for the effects.  I was trying to be aware of any changes in my preception that would indicate the drug was taking effect.  My friend who got me the E was sitting near by talking with his friend that had the E.  This is when it hit me, and hit me it did.<BR>
<BR>
I was just sitting there, and suddenly I had a slight feeling of 'spacyness'.  I thought, well this might be something.  By the time that thought was done I was launched right into it.  It felt amazing.  Everything felt different, but right.  I started moving my hands in frount of me because it felt good.  Every motion felt fluid and right.  Like I was perfectly coordinated, and my body did everything I wanted it to.  I motioned my friend over and told him it had began.  This was about 20-25 minutes after taking the pill.  I told him that this was my first time, which he had not previously known, and he introduced me to his friend that sold the pills.  I thanked his friend so much, I was so greatfull for the experience.  I also asked him for a sucker, because I was experiencing some major jaw clentch.  He gave me one and I was very greatfull.  This is when my friend offered me a backrub.<BR>
<BR>
What happened next was the most amazing experience of my life.  I sat in fount of him and he begain to do his thing.  He was very good at this as he had done it many times before.  I ceased to exsist, and I was only pleasure.  It was truely amazing.  As he worked my back I moved my hands in front of me with my eyes closed.  Listning to the music and absolutely enjoying the moment.  He moved to my head and this is when I couldn't do anything else.  It just felt amazing.  I fell back into his lap and let him do his thing while saying this is the most amazing thing of my life, which he laughed at.  He moved to my arms and I just sat there, enjoying it competely.  I couldn't believe how good it felt.  During the last parts of the massage I had a constant urge to get up and dance, but I couldn't bring my self to pull away from this experience, and I'm glad I didn't.  <BR>
<BR>
He finished and I thanked him.  I told him that I think I have to dance and he said 'well then go dance'.  Like I said before, I've never been big on dancing, but today was different.  I just let go and did what I wanted.  I totally submersed myself in the music.  After a short while I became aware that I was very thirsty.  I went and bought a bottle of water, $1, not too bad, and asked for a hug from the girl selling the water.  She gave me a hug and asked for a tip.  I put a dollar in the tip jar and smilled.  I smilled lots during this night.  It was amazing.  I spent most of the next 4 hours dancing and meeting people.  I must have hugged 40+ people, and smilled at tonnes more.  Everyone looked so beautiful and the music was just amazing.<BR>
<BR>
I moved around all night.  From one dance spot to another, and back again.  I spent time by the speakers as that felt amazing and I went outside to greet and meet people.  As I would walk by I would give a friendly 'hi' to everybody.  Most would say hi back.  I felt so open and friendly, and ALL of my inhabitions were gone.  If I wanted to do something I would do it, but part of my thinking was always what would be best for the party.  Like I wouldn't do something to interfere with the party atmosphere because I didn't want to upset the amazing mood of the night.<BR>
<BR>
When the 'crash' came, it came fast.  Almost as fast as the drug took effect.  I didn't like the fact that it was over so fast.  I just wanted it to go on and if someone had offered me more I would have taken it for sure, but no one did.  I wasnt depressed or even sad.  In fact I felt great.  Better then I had in a long time, even with the drugs effects basically gone.  This was about T+4hous.  Most importantly though, I still loved dancing.  I was abit more selfconsious now, but not enough to stop me.  I still loved and even now love dancing, and this is the night after.  I danced for a few hours more, but became increasingly cold, which made me have to go to the cooldown room, which had some beds and some blankets.  I didn't sleep, but layed there untill morning when I got up and found a ride home.<BR>
<BR>
Even going home, while I was on the street I danced.  I just feels good.  Cars would be at a stop light and I'd be dancing to the beats in my head.  I love it and I love Extasy.  I'm going to try and spread my use out to about every month or so, so that I dont ruin it too fast like other people have.<BR>
<BR>
Before this experience I really wanted to try acid.  I still do but to a far lesser extent.  I would be happy having trips like my last E experience everytime I do drugs.<BR>
<BR>
From this experince I have gained a love of E, dancing, and a better outlook on things.  I believe it has helped me open up and not be so selfconsious about myself.  This may just be part of the afterglow though and I wait to see what I'm going to feel like in a week.<!--   End Body   -->

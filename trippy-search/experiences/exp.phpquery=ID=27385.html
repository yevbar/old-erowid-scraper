Let me start by saying that I usually don’t use the pleasure drugs. I’m more of a hallucinogen freak. But I decided to try something different this time.<br>
<br>
It all started on Wednesday when I asked one of my co-workers, call him P, if he was still looking for any coke. I had recently just found a possible supplier. But he said that someone had just dropped some Peruvian flake on him so I asked if I could buy some off of him. I ended up getting some on Friday, he said it was a gram but it looked like more than that to me. But how the fuck should I know. It wasn’t all powder, but rather flakes like he said. It had some kind of moisture or oil to it and I had to chop it up myself. I had never seen coke like this before but damn if it weren’t good shit. I had only had it once before when I bought a gram about a year ago. And that stuff was garbage compared to this stuff I got now. So I was at work and I chopped a little bit of it up and cut out a line, a fairly small line since I didn’t have no tolerance. I rolled up a post-it note and was about to snort it when I heard a truck pull up right in front of my warehouse. I am usually there by myself so I can get away with this crazy shit. “Fuck, it’s my boss!” I thought and quickly swept the line into my palm and jammed the baggie into my pocket. I looked and it was just my friend H. “Yeah you better peek around the corner and see who it is.” He said. “What, were you getting ready to smoke a joint?” <br>
<br>
“I was thinking bout it.” I said, trying to hide the powder still in my hand. We talked for a few minutes and then he left.  So I dumped the shit back onto the desk. Fuck, it was all wet with sweat but I cut it into a line again and snorted it anyway. About twenty seconds later I began to feel that rush that I hadn’t stopped thinking about ever since the first time I ever tried it. I was surprised at how high I got just from that one little line. When I got home that night I snorted line after line from four p.m. till about two or three in the morning. I was playing my guitar and just having a great time. I smoked some weed, had three or four beers but I didn’t feel any of that. The cocaine overpowered all. Cigarettes were especially nice. By the end of the night, my face was numb, my nose and eyes were running like crazy, but I didn’t care much about that as long as I could stay high. It seems like once you start on a serious coke binge all you care about is hitting that next line. I don’t really remember Saturday night but I think it went pretty much the same except I smoked a lot more weed and I remember the weed and the coke kinda fighting it out. Sunday night was the worst though. I was out all day and I had left my shit at home because I definitely needed a fucking break. But when I got back home at about nine or ten I broke it out and started hittin’ it real hard. At one point I think I took a little too much and I started getting “the fear”. My heart was racing but I think this was more due to the fear than the coke. I started thinking “oh shit am I gonna OD?”. This kind of trip used to happen to me all the time when I first started smoking weed a few years ago and the paranoia would kick in. So I knew that all I really needed to do was mellow out. I went out side and had a cigarette, which helped a hell of a lot. I remember getting really angry at one point too because I couldn’t find my damn guitar slide. I ended up borrowing my roommate’s slide instead. I would hit a line and go play guitar for a while, hit another line watch some TV, have a cig, hit another line etc. etc. It went on like this until five-thirty in the morning. And I had to be at work at seven. I was still so fucking high when I finally hit the sack. I lay there for a few minutes and it was like I felt sleep trying to grab a hold of me, but my head was so fucked I thought it was death trying to get a hold of me. Needless to say, this really freaked me out. I was in a state of delusional half-sleep for about an hour. When the alarm went off, it didn’t really wake me up but I somehow got up and hit the snooze and fell back down again. (My alarm is set up so I have to get up out of bed to reach it, helps me get up.) I was like a zombie. Finally after about the fifth time I was able to jerk myself awake. I could look at the clock and read the time but it just didn’t make sense to me. I wasn’t sure if I should go to work or go back to bed. I finally snapped out of this state. I picked up some clothes off the floor, smelled them to see if they were reasonably clean and put them on. Bathroom; looked in the mirror and oh my god my eyes were so red. No time to shower, forgot to brush teeth. Remembered deodorant though :). I was still somewhat in a confused state of mind as I was driving to work. Took the coke with me ‘cause I though I’d probably need it. (Man, this is gettin’ bad.) Stopped at ampm got a burger, juice and eyedropps. I made it into work a few minutes late, had a coffee, had a couple bumps. In fact, just had one as I started writing this. So here I am, just about ready to get off of work and that’s my story so far. I guess all I can say is be careful and think twice before fucking around w/ this shit. I don’t know what will happen when I run out probably today or tomorrow. Fuck. I’ll try not to buy any more but I just don’t know, (sigh). Anyway, please be careful, Peace.<!--   End Body   -->

In my hometown, I met a guy who turned out to be one of my very best friends.  As I got to know him better, I soon learned that he used drugs.  Now, at the time, I didn't, so I kind of looked down on him for it.  Eventually, he convinced me to try marijuana, but then I went to college, and I didn't see him until summer.  That summer, I went to his house one day, and he suggested that we go into the woods with two other friends of ours and his girlfriend and take some Dex (our name for DXM).  Not having anything to do that day, I agreed.<BR>
<BR>
Soon after, the others that would take the journey with us arrived, and one of the guys measured out the doses of Dex.  After taking half of our doses, we went out onto the nature trail that was to be our trip spot.  We started out in the woods, slightly off the trail, where we took the other half of our doses.  After chilling and drinking some OJ, I started to feel a little strange, although the sensation was not at all unpleasent.  We went down to a lake that was nearby and talked for a while, and then suddenly I realized that I was alone with the one guy I knew the least.  I slowly realized that everyone had gone around the lake to a clearing, but I just sat and talked to my friend about life.  At this point I had lost all understanding of what was occuring around me, but I didn't care.  I simply sat and watched as a daddy longlegs walked on my arm and marveled at its life force.  Soon I found myself walking around the lake to the clearing, where we smoked a bowl.  However, there were boats on the lake, so we walked back to the trail and sat for a while.  We then stood up and formed a circle, and bowed our heads in the middle.  As I looked down, a strange voice told us to fall into the earth, and as it said this I slowly slid out of my body into the ground.  I have no idea how long this oneness with the earth lasted, but when we went into the circle, it was bright daylight.  When we came out of the circle, it was pitch black outside.  After talking about the experience, we used the flashlights we brought with to find our way home.<BR>
<BR>
After we got home, we smoked two more bowls and talked about the experience.  Although I or they will never be able to properly explain what happened in the woods, I can say that it was one of the most incredible experiences of my life.<!--   End Body   -->

Before this trip on methamphetamine, I had been using meth heavily for around two months. On this day, I was visiting my hometown from college for my birthday. When I got off the airplane, I was in very bad condition. I weighed 30 lbs less than the last time my parents had seen me and had a black eye and a broken nose from a fight I had gotten in while on meth. I ended up getting into a huge fight with my parents and they kicked me out of the house. So my boyfriend M. picked me up and took me to a hotel to celebrate my birthday with his cousin C. and C.'s girlfriend A. M had recently made a large drug pickup and we had surplus amounts of methamphetamine on our hands. So as soon as we got settled into the hotel, we started snorting lines and smoking.<br>
<br>
For a while, everything was like a normal meth trip. We all became hyper-creative and started drawing. C. was drawing weird geometric people and I was drawing Egyptians. C. and A. left the room to pick up some sodas, while I decided to lay down on the bed. From where I was laying, the ceiling looked like it was made of water. It was warping and flowing and changing colors constantly. It was weird but very pretty. When C. and A. came back into the room, I pointed out this phenomenon to A. Apparently C. and A. could see the water-ceiling as well, so we all laid down on the bed to watch the show. M. wanted nothing to do with this because he knows the warning signs of a St. Jimmy meth freak-out and this is one of the signs. However, I was totally oblivious to this fact.<br>
<br>
After about 10 minutes, A. sat up and noticed that a large vortex was forming in the corner of the hotel room. From this vortex, which looked like a smoky grey cube imploding on itself, emerged hundreds of shadowy figures. They were roughly human in shape and seemed to be composed entirely of shadows. They had no facial features or clothing or any type of distinguishing marks. Being avid researchers of the paranormal, we instantly recognized these creatures to be Shadow People. Panic quickly set in as the shadow people began to circle the room. <br>
<br>
At some point M. finally put down his pen and joined the chaos that was rapidly forming in the room. C., A., and I were huddled in one of the beds together, hyperventilating and in a general state of panic. Shadow people may not sound too frightening to those who know nothing about them, but as people who understand these creatures we knew enough to be terrified. Shadow people are not malevolent beings. They are horrible extradimensional beings that prey on human energy. Not a good situation to be in when we are spun and paranoid enough as it is. <br>
<br>
We began talking about what we thought the shadow people were and came to the conclusion that they were beings from another dimension that had entered our dimension through the vortex. Methamphetamine had allowed our bodies to vibrate at a higher resonance than usual and this attracted the shadow people. <br>
<br>
C. decided that smoking more meth would make the shadow people go away, so A. and I sat on the edge of the bed while C. held the pipe and lit it for us. In retrospect, I realize that this was a horrible idea. All we did was make the experience even more intense. Finally, M. jumped in and fed A. and I some Xanax to calm us down. Unfortunately, nothing happened.  The shadow people continued to assault our senses and terrify us.<br>
<br>
M. and A. decided that they would attempt to take photos of the shadow people with their cellphones. So they took off on an expedition to the bathroom, which for some reason seemed the best place to take photos to all of us. C. and I sat on the end of my bed and waited for their return. I noticed that the closer to C. I got, the more intense the visualizations got. A. later stated that she noticed the same thing when near M. We later decided that C. and M. were conduits for A. and my psychic energy and that they increased our ability to perceive the shadow people. <br>
<br>
Soon, a mass about the size of a human torso began forming underneath the table. It was a large, translucent blob with no discernable form. C. and I started screaming for M. and A. to come back and they ran into the room. The blob started speaking to me telepathically, telling me that it was going to spiritually possess me and use my body to murder my friends. <br>
<br>
As it was speaking it began climbing up my body. It inserted three tentacles into my navel and began to enter my body. Where the tentacles touched me, I felt a sensation similar to ice-cold needles being pushed through my skin. I wanted to get up and run away but the creature had me completely paralyzed. A. started screaming at me to run and for M. and C. to do something, but they just stood there, dumbfounded. A. took matters into her own hands and took a flying leap at the creature and tackled it, ripping it out of my body. M. grabbed me under my arms and C. grabbed my legs and carried me to the other bed. During this my body was still completely frozen. They dumped me on the bed and tried to get me to respond but for a few minutes I was unable to move or speak. I have very vague memories of what happened next. All I recall is A. telling me that the creature was gone.<br>
<br>
After I came back from my state of paralysis, M. ordered me into the shower. I refused and started crying, telling him that the shadow people were in the shower and that I didn't want to be in the same place as them. M. grabbed me by the arm and basically dragged me into the bathroom. He undressed me and shoved me into the shower and then climbed in after me. I became completely hysterical, seeing shadow people all around me. I huddled up in a ball, making myself as small as humanly possible. At this point, I doubt I was coherent. I was babbling while sobbing and shaking and trying to hide in the shower. <br>
<br>
M. dragged me to my feet and asked me if I thought the rest of my life was going to be like this. I nodded. He then told me that if I was like this for the rest of my life he couldn't be with me anymore. Then I really lost it. I started crying harder and screaming at him. I don't remember what I said. All I remember is M. spitting in my face and shaking me as hard as he could and M. yelling at me to calm down. Eventually he got me calm enough to actually take a shower (the shadow people were mostly gone by this time). He dried me off and dressed me because I was incapable of doing it myself and walked me out to the bedroom.<br>
<br>
From the looks of things, C. and A. had just had a conversation similar to ours. C. looked totally drained, as did M., and A. was laying in the bed sobbing and exhausted. M. and I climbed into our bed and after a while of laying in bed in a state of total paranoia, we all finally drifted off for a few hours sleep. <br>
<br>
The shadow people stayed with me for a few months. I saw them constantly, even when I wasn't high. I personally believe that what we saw that night was real. M. disagrees and believes that everything we saw was drug-induced. I am no longer on speaking terms with C. and A. and thus cannot put forth their opinions. I believe that A. and I have some sort of psychic powers and that methamphetamine put us in a highly receptive state. To further complicate this matter is the subject of the photos. We all saw shadow people in those photos when we reviewed them at a later time. Today however, M. claims that there is nothing in those photos and they all have mysteriously 'disappeared' (all photos were on M.'s phone). I think he is in denial and does not want to face what the four of us went through and so disposed of the photos. <br>
<br>
Meth basically ruined my life through a long series of events. In the end, I ended up with methamphetamine-induced schizophrenia.<!--   End Body   -->

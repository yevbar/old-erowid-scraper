Opiates are among my closest friends ever since I had surgery for wisdom-teeth removal and got 30 5mg vicodin as compensation.  It was the first time I had ever seen any sort of narcotic painkiller and the next week at high school flew by in a warm-buzzing haze.  Over the years, I have eagerly taken any opportunity I have found to ingest vicodin, percocet, dilaudid or oxycontin. I'm a bit of a coward when it comes to drug use, and never put anything in my nose or blood--just chew.  Living in the USA makes it a bit harder to find opiates, but I also live in Virginia, home of Hillbilly Heroin, so it's not impossible.<br>
<br>
One year, while in Canada skiing, I visited a drugstore hoping that they would sell OTC (over-the-counter) tylenol 3 as I had been told.  To my dismay, they did not sell tylenol 3, but instead a generic kind of analgesic pill that had 325mg of acetominophen, 8mg of codeine and 15mg of caffeine.  I bought a bottle of 100 pills anyway, since it cost less than five dollars.  A couple of years passed without giving the pills much thought--it takes a lot more than 8mg for a buzz, and more than 1200mg makes me vomit a lot, so I assumed that they were worthless.  All of that changed when I found online the instructions for cold-water codeine extraction.  I read through the steps, skeptical still, but all of the information seemed to make sense, and the solubility table was enough for me to give it a shot.<br>
<br>
I crushed up 8 pills into a fine powder and dumped it into about 8oz of warm water.  I stirred for 10 minutes until the solution had reached room temperature again, and then put the cup into the freezer.  It took another 20-30 minutes before the water felt cold to the touch.  I filtered it through a coffee filter twice and was left with a very slightly-milky clearish liquid.  It didn't smell like much of anything, but I was concerned about consuming too much acetominophen.  Eventually, after deciding whether to drink it or pour it out, I drank it.  I was warned that it would taste extremely bitter, but to my delight, it was only very bitter, and there wasn't much of an aftertaste.  I began timing with my wristwatch (something I do each time I take painkillers for some reason), expecting that it would kick in sooner than the 15 minutes it normally takes with pills.<br>
<br>
30 minutes later, I still didn't feel any different, and began researching the effects of acetominophen overdose.  Another 15 minutes passed and finally I began to feel the familiar internal glow spreading out from my lower abdomen.  I was ecstatic that this procedure had actually worked.  The buzz I got from the 64mg was very very mild, but I was encouraged to try again.<br>
<br>
After that fateful day, each day thereafter I crushed up the pills and followed the same procedure.  First with 90mg then with 112mg.  The latter yielded very desireable results.  I experienced absolutely no nausea and was quite affected.  112mg felt about the same as taking 15mg of hydrocodone.  At this point I was so confident with the method, that I continued to do it each day, and as a result began to feel the tolerance rearing its ugly head.  To counteract this I decided to make a batch of fun-juice extra potent.  I had read online that most (ab)users of codeine would take doses of above 200mg, and so I was confident that 'playing it safe' at 185mg was a good decision.  <br>
<br>
After drinking the now extremely bitter liquid and waiting about 30 minutes I felt the wave come on.  It was delightful--much more so than any other opiate experience has been.  30 minutes after the onset, I realized that I had overshot a little.  I could feel nausea building in the back of my head, but it wasn't powerful enough to cause discomfort.  When I arrived at work that day, my extremities were tingling (more a symptom of anxiety, I believe, because I experience this occasionally with other drugs) and it was much more labor-intesive to breathe normally.  Each breath was forced in and out of my body with a conscious effort, and I caught myself not breathing at all on a few occasions.<br>
<br>
An hour passed and so too did the difficulty of breathing, but was replaced instead with some of the most intense nausea I have experienced.  I had read that if you lie in prone position, it is an instant nausea cure for opiates, and went back to my car to test the theory.  I reclined my seat all the way and stayed for 10 minutes.  The theory was partially true, as when I was on my back I didn't feel ill--however, as soon as I stood, I was punched in the face with the urge to projectile vomit.  The day continued in this fashion.  I drank bottle after bottle of water and made frequent trips to the bathroom to avoid vomiting in the actual office area.  Eventually I called it quits, told the other folks in the office that I was leaving and headed out to my car.  On the way there I began retching, and expelled about a pint of water and nothing more.  This vomit was very similar to another I experienced after taking altogether too much DXM.  It was extremely painful, and caused a brief period of panic-ridden asphyxiation.<br>

<br>
When finally I was able cough up the remaining fluid and was able to breathe again, I was still being pounded by intense nausea.  I drove home and went immediately to my bed, upon which I quickly fell asleep for eight hours.  When I awoke, I no longer felt the drug and had a mild headache.  Needless to say, I will never do opiates again.  And by that, I mean that I will go back to doing smaller amounts.<!--   End Body   -->

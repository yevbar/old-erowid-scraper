I am someone who is relatively experienced with psychoactives and other mind altering substances. I decided one weekend that I would try it out because none of my friends had the guts and we wanted to know what it was like. I had procured a 63 gram package of ground nutmeg, and was planning on mixing it with liquid to cut the taste. That was a mistake. It only brings out the awful taste that is already hard to handle. I ended up tossing it in my mouth as it is, swallowing, and having a chaser of root beer. It sucks, but it's the least painful way. I tried mixing it with root beer and the results were horrible. It all rose to the surface in a bubbly mush which made it hard to handle. The taste was amplified greatly, and it ruined the drink.<br>
<br>
It can get pretty sedative and nice at times, but there were no hallucinogenic qualities in any of my 3 experiences (all at quite high doses). The biggest problems have yet to come. For the next week, my gastro-intestinal tract was working it's ass off to get this crap out of my system, and serious cramping can be a problem. Gas is also very prominent, and occurs often (the infamous 'megers are awful). Nutmeg burps are bad too, and usually occur during the experience.<br>
<br>
The timing went something like this:<br>
<br>
8:00 PM: 21 grams (a third of a 63 gram package bye eye) of nutmeg ingested<br>
<br>
9:00 PM: Waiting for results. Numerous unpleasant burps occur.<br>
<br>
9:30 PM: I think it starts to kick in a bit, but it may be a placebo type effect.<br>
<br>
10:00 PM: I finally feel something for sure, it is a drunk like feeling, with less motor skill impairment and more perception alteration.<br>
<br>
11:00 PM: Sedation and more 'mental' impairment occur (mental = perception or thought processes).<br>
<br>
12:00 PM: More effects come on, and though I don’t actually see anything, there are very slight hallucinogenic effects like streaming lights and/or shadows in the corners of eyes.<br>
<br>
1:00 PM: Sedative effects are so strong I fall asleep (luckily in my bed).<br>
<br>
The next week: Bad side-effects ranging from horrible gas to stomache pain to light sensitivity (yes, light sensitivity). There are others, but too many to list.<!--   End Body   -->

Well one night I was chilling with my closest friends when we decieded to do methadone, they had all done it before, but it was a first for me so I decieded to swallow it opposed to snorting it like they did...<BR>
<BR>
40 minutes passed and I got kinda weak and sank into the couch...<BR>
60 minutes passes and I noticed that if I even moved the slightest inch I felt naseous...at this point I was disappointed, ALL I felt was sick and weak, no euphoric feeling, no lightheadedness, nothing, just sick...<BR>
<BR>
later we went for a drive to get something, I felt so sick I don't remember what the hell it even was, except that I sat in the back seat cuddled up to my friend thinking that maybe if I just stayed as still as possible I might not puke all over his car...<BR>
<BR>
I don't know how, but we somehow made it back to his house where we curled up on the couch and assumed the same position (the less I move the better chance I have of barfing everywhere)...<BR>
<BR>
hours passed and I still wasn't feeling any better, but I had to go home....the second I stood up to leave EVERYTHING in my stomach came up....I've never puked so much or so hard in my life (not to mention that whatever it was was bright green)...but I had to admit that after throwing up I felt a little better, at least enough to drive home...made it home and into bed thinking I would wake up in the morning and at least feel a little better....god was I wrong<BR>
<BR>
I woke up and felt 100 times worse! to make a long story short I felt like a fucking crack addict! I would sweat to the point where my bed was soaked and feel like I was on fire then 10 minutes later be so cold that I was uncontrollably shivering.....this went on for the next 24 hours where I managed to throw up till there wasn't anything left in my stomach then drive heave for HOURS!!!! <BR>
<BR>
at one point it was so bad that I really considered calling 911, never in my life (and I've done a lot of drugs) had I felt like this before..<!--   End Body   -->

All the reports I've read here about fentanyl seem pretty negative or not very positive, so I'd like to share my experience with this drug.<br>
<br>
I got the gel patches for free a few months ago, 4 patches to be exact. I decided to be stupid and eat the gel inside. I took a little drop at a time, put it on a paperclip, and stuck it under my tounge. 5-15 minutes later I would do more until I had the desired effects.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I loved this stuff. It made me feel pretty damn euphoric, as well as relaxed. Eventually when I went to bed it seemed to have psychedelic effects, the same every time. I would always hear voices having conversations or see shadows move out of the side of me eye...stuff like that. I enjoyed this a lot and it was a fun way to get to sleep every night. Around this time I would also get pleasently itchy if I had done enough.<br>
<br>
I continued use 3 days in a row, a 2 day break, then 3 days again etc. The first patch lasted into the second cycle, but by the end I was using half a patch a night. I took a break for about a week when I only had one patch left, but I still had a high tolerance when I came back to it.<br>
<br>
Recently I tried oxycontin and I found the effects extremely similar, oxy just had more of an itch. The only problem was I needed 80mg of oxy to feel the effects much at all (common doseage is 20), and that's snorting it. So watch out for opiate tolerance, cause fentanyl does that well. I felt myself always craving that taste when it was gone, and I might have gone through a minor withdrawl (only 2 weeks of use, so it may have been a sickness).<!--   End Body   -->

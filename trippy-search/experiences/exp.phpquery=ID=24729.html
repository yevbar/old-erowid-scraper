<!--   Start Body   -->


Chemical abuse began early in the day, with the consumption of a 30-cm meatball sub on wheat with barbecue sauce, washed down by ~500 mL generic fruit punch.  Caloric intake for the remainder of the day was provided by Milano double chocolate Distinctive Cookies, consumed every three to four hours.  At 20:20 that evening, 15 mg 2C-T-4 were ingested orally.  To give a quick summary, noticeable 'psychoactive' effects lasted eleven to twelve hours, the greatest unpleasantness being mild stomach discomfort beginning about 1 hour into the trip and lasting about ninety minutes.  A mild headache the following morning was cured by an Alleve tablet, and might (this was not a controlled experiment) have been due to my lack of caffeine the previous day.  My trip was somewhat visual, markedly tactile and perhaps a trifle psychological.<BR>
<BR>
About a month ago, I broke a long habit of leafing through books I'd already read, and instead inhaled a continuous stream of new ones.  I started with Larry Gonick's **Cartoon History of the Universe III**, continued through with **Catch-22** and **Breakfast of Champions**, took a brief break before Pynchon's **Vineland** and then Hofstadter's **Godel, Escher, Bach**.  Perhaps as a result, the trip's early stage was damnably literary, with wordy thoughts flashing across my consciousness.  After my stomach settled somewhat, I pulled **Ulysses** off my shelf and started reading Nighttown, figuring it was adequately hallucinatory to speed me on my way.  A few pages into Bloom's escapade, I noticed an effect I'd previously seen on both LSD and 2C-B: letters on previous pages were showing through more than usual, and words on my current page swished about their positions, never going too far but never staying put either.<BR>
<BR>
The first tactile sensation---muscle tension throughout my limbs, familiar as an old friend from 2C-T-2---appeared at roughly T + 1:00. I set Joyce aside and tried to cultivate closed-eye hallucinations, figuring that this was the quickest way to reach someplace interesting.  Light leaking from my eyelids' lower edges made an appealing double-halo effect.  I sat below a blue neon lamp; its afterimage became a white arc-light band which bounced about my field of view.  Pretty swirlies accompanied all this.  2C-T-4 gave me remarkable tactile and proprioceptive effects; more than once I found myself sliding into the body of a fictional character of the opposite gender.<BR>
<BR>
I was able to drink milk without any gastric complaints.<BR>
<BR>
Vanishingly few erotic components to the entire evening's entertainment.  Approximately three hours into the trip, I did notice an odd internal sensation which would have been compatible with sex, but wasn't terribly sexual in and of itself.  It was almost like a Salvia experience I once had of pressure waves moving through my body and bouncing off my skin's insides.  2C-T-4 lent a little credence to a Qi notion, an idea of energy centers strung along my spinal axis.  If I could explain more with this picture, I'd like it a lot.  These energy globes oscillated for a while, then diminished when I began paying more attention to other people.<BR>
<BR>
The latter eight hours were spent more in my friends' company.  Some of them were intoxicated, most sober.  I could interact as well as baseline; read the list of books I cited to judge if my baseline performance is at all 'normal'. <BR>
<BR>
Eight hours after ingestion, I felt myself decidedly coming down, and I smoked a few lungfuls of marijuana to smooth the descent (a tactic I learned from 2C-T-2).  During the final hours, a friend and I walked two and a half miles to see another acquaintance who had tried his first phenethylamine that night.  We saw a gloriously subtle pastel sunrise and became quite unbecomingly irritated when we found the donut shop wasn't open yet.  I snuggled into my bed and had a long sequence of progressively less coherent closed-eye visuals, resembling at times wireframe graphics and sometimes Japanese animation. Mandala-like images floated across my ceiling when I opened my eyes; the closed-eye visuals returned as expected, along with the proprioceptive hallucination of my body's switching forms.  I definitely remember a few minutes being a multitentacled mollusc; this was probably the highest intensity of sexual feeling the trip gave me. <BR>
<BR>
Overall, 2C-T-4's most notable psychological effect was to concentrate me into the present moment.  Sensory input seemed so rich and detailed that I found it difficult to think about future events.  I could handle the past, though, at least as anecdotes I retold to my companions.  I would have a very hard time being upset at a late train, for example, during a 2C-T-4 trip.  I didn't observe an outstanding 'peak'; instead, the drug's highest-intensity effects lasted with considerable constancy for six or seven hours.  Both coming up and coming down were gradual processes.<BR>
<BR>
The following day was lazy, though perhaps not much lazier than any other Sunday I've had whilst running on three hours' sleep.  Again, Milano cookies provided nourishment.  I wouldn't mind a similar 2C-T-4 dose again, although I would ingest my dose at least two hours earlier, to save the 'morning after' wear and tear.  The body load might be a little much for this to be an art museum drug, but not by far.<!--   End Body   -->

I will put the story regarding the most fucked up experience at the Nassau Greatfuld dead show. I took 1 whole sugar cube..It had like a blue dot where the drop was made. Someone later told me, examining the other cubes I had, that it looked like 3, or 4 hits. I freaked out! I have tripped many times and after reading lots about the acid tests and lots of history about the 60's I believed I was normal, and was just having fun. I never before 'Freaked' or even got out of hand, this night..I was so far gone. It involved me running across the highway in the middle of the night, thinking I was going to be kidnapped, and was being chased, then after trying to break store windows to get the police, I tried to kick in the little booth at a gas station mini mart. Because I thought one of the customers was one of the killers and he was gonna shoot me. I screamed and begged the gas station guy to call 911 and he wouldn't listen so I started kicking the door thinking he was in on it.<BR>
<BR>
Police arrived and I thought they were the black military.(all the cops 3 cruisers showed up, they were all black) I thought I had been captured by the black military and he questioned me and put me in the cruiser. I was waiting when 4 guys pulled up and I later found that they were just asking for directions, I thought they were asking the black military to give me up..(they were white in hippy clothes) I figured this was the white hippy group trying to save me from the black military, So I told the cops I didn't feel well so I could get out of the back seat. (I had used this tactic originally to jump out of the car on the highway, of the two girls I thought were kidnapping me.) When I got out of the cruiser I grabbed one of the hippies shirt and screamed and begged him to take me with them.. The guy looked at me Like I was NUTS. I said 'You know me right???? Please take me with you' He was like...I don't know you dude...He was looking at me like i WAS A MENTAL PATIENT. <BR>
<BR>
Well I ended up going to the police station and My girlfriend had to take a cab from Manhattan to Long island just to get me home. They let me off saying I had just smoked some bad pot, but the chief officer wanted to bust me for LSD But I had nothing on me..MY pupils were HUGE the Cops were like woa look at this guys eyes. Any how the cops turned out to be real nice and probably saved my life. At the point they found me at the gas station, I begged the cops not to shoot me. It was a fucked up night and I say, Do Blotter acid stay away from the cubes or liquid if you have an imagination. it really was like getting wacked on the head I had no idea what was real and what was fantasy. <BR>
<BR>
But I admit when I got to Orlando to see the dead..I took a half of the other cube :-) I just figured don't let my imagination run wild.. Try and behave normal and think happy thoughts..If you think about bad, sad, or painful situations while tripping they will put you on a bad trip..I thought a bad trip was bullshit..people who didn't know how to take the drug. But it got me and I was really freaked out. I honestly believed I was going to die that night. I apologize for the typing but I am really tired.<!--   End Body   -->

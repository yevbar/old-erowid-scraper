<b>Pethidine</b> is also known as <b>meperidine</b> a.k.a <b>Demerol</b>, an opiate agonist used for moderate to severe pain, with an equivalency of 7.5 mg of pethidine to 1 mg of morphine in parenteral administration. Pethidine/meperidine has a duration of 2 hours so it's a pretty short acting opioid. I was out doctor shopping the whole of last night and didn't get a hit out of the five medical establishments I went to. I guess six is my lucky number coz I managed to get a pethidine IM injection from it. =D<br>
<br>

<br>
This is <b>Injection Pethidine Hydrochloride 50 mg/ml</b> made by <b>DuoPharma</b> (Malaysia). I have never tried pethidine IM injection so imagine my glee as I made this happen. ,)<br>
<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>You were here for DF-118 last time right? The medical record says you have a bad back.<br>
<b>Me: </b>I actually had a slipped disc (actually, I don't ,)) and it slipped again for the second time.<br>
(makes 'ouch face', grimaces and made as if my spinal cord was killing me)<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>Do we have DF-118 here? (talking to nurse)<br>
<b>Nurse: </b>(after rummaging through the restricted access medication cabinet, they don't have it, I know that coz I've been here before) No we don't, but we have Voltaren.<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>Do you want something else? I can give you another pain-killer.<br>
<b>Me: </b>(Hell no! It's opiates or nothing) Doctor, I hope you can help coz I'm in a lot of pain right now. Can you write a script or something?<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>Okay, do you have a medical history of your slipped disc?<br>
<b>Me: </b>Yeah, I had an MRI and X-Ray done in KL, where it happened (which didn't happen, of course ,)) and the prognosis was a slipped disc, which I slipped again just now (*grimace of pain*)<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>Do you have it with you?<br>
<b>Me: </b>No, I'm sorry doctor, I left the medical documents in KL...<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>Okay, well since you have a prior here, I'll script you. Is there anything else?<br>
<b>Me: </b>(pushing my luck, deciding to go for gold) Hey, I know this is a strange question, but I'm in a lot of pain right now, do you have anything to help me get through tonight? Can you give me a morphine shot? (Prays to God he doesn't go amok)<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>Morphine...hmm...well, we do have morphine but we don't give it to outpatients. I think we have pethidine though, do you want that?<br>
<b>Me: </b>Is pethidine an opiate? (Knowing full well it is, but no harm in playing the dumb patient)<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>Yes it is.<br>
(Writes <b><em>Pethidine 50 mg IM stat</em></b> on my medical record)<br>
<b>Me: </b>(looks) (tries not to grin) (tries not to grin again, perhaps somewhat unsuccessfully) Thank you very much doctor.<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>Alright, just lie there and I'll prep the shot.<br>
<b>Me: </b>(puts on a show of painful lying down and bolts straight up, apparently with a good back again) Hey, I'm sorry doctor, another unusual request, can I take a photo of the pethidine vial?<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>Why?<br>
<b>Me: </b>It's just an interest of mine. (starts photoshoot of the IM pethidine 50 mg snap off ampoule) Thanks doctor.<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>Okay, I'm going to inject you now. Turn over.<br>
<b>Me: </b>Er...can I take the IM injection in my arm? (I don't want the doctor to see my thigh, which is the best place to bang shit if you're holding down a professional job - full of scar marks and bruises from injections - he would have known for sure I'm an IDU - Injecting Drug User).<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>(Grips my arm) Seems to be okay here.<br>
<b>Me: </b>(starts filming the procedure)<br>

<b>Script from pethidine injection video:</b><br>
<b>Me: </b>Is it in? Pethidine 50 mg?<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>Mmm...<br>
<b>Me: </b>Okay, IM, sixthseal.com (Jesus Christ, I should not have said that in the video but it just slipped out).<br>
(sounds of pethidine injection process)<br>
<b>Me: </b>Yeah, that's the place.<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>Hmm...why do you have some bruises here?<br>
(OMG those are my IM injection spots when I was injecting ketamine)<br>
<b>Me: </b>Er...uh...they're some just bruises, ya know. I probably hit something.<br>
(Quickly changes subject)<br>
<b>Me: </b>So, is that pethidine 50 mg?<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>Yeah.<br>
<b>Me: </b>Thanks.<br>
[video no longer available]<br>
<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>Are you driving?<br>
<b>Me: </b>Er...no. (actually I am)<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>This will cause the usual opiate side effects, drowsiness etc. so be careful.<br>
<b>Me: </b>I will, my friend is just outside (actually no one is outside, I don't take friends on doctor shopping expedition after a disastrous incident where I lost a good doctor coz me and my friend was stoned and high on meth and she had a laughing fit).<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>Okay, here is your script. You're not a drug addict are you?<br>
<b>Me: </b>(*coughs and nearly chokes*) Of course I'm not. I hate drugs. ,) (I didn't wink, I'm just winking on the blog)<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>Good.<br>

<b>Pethidine Experience Report:</b><br>
(10 minutes after the shot)<br>
<b>Me: </b>I'm not feeling it yet, doctor? How long does it take to kick in?<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>It's not going to be so fast.<br>
<b>Me: </b>So we can't IV pethidine huh?<br>
<b>Doctor: </b>(gives me a strange look) No, it's for IM.<br>
<b>Me: </b>Okay, thank you very, very much doctor.<br>
(Shakes doctor's hand very vigorously, perhaps too enthusiastic to be unsuspicious)<br>

T+ 0:30: A general feeling of elation and well being. Don't know if it's the pethidine or the euphoria of getting away with a shot of pethidine just like that.<br>
T+ 0:45: Cigarettes smokes well, like on opiates but it's nowhere near as strong as dihydrocodeine. It does give a rather pleasant high though - kinda chill, but still motivated, I'm typing this as we speak, which I usually don't.<br>
T+ 1:00: I think this is the peak - it's nothing special - I could compare it to a cross between tramadol and codeine if that makes sense. It feels like tramadol + codeine...and er, it seems a wee bit hallucinatory, I don't know how to explain it, it's like the feeling when I get a hit of LSD and am about to come up and trip, but it never happens. I just mentioned it coz I saw the cigarette smoke drifting off. Perhaps a more apt description would be a very mild case of Ambien induced hallucinations.<br>
T+ 1:30: Hey, I'm feeling a little of that opiate warmth now. It's nice but too mild for my tolerance.<br>
<br>
50 mg of pethidine wasn't enough to get me off, but I did feel good - which part of it is the phethedine and which part is the elation of pulling this shit off is subjective. I'm full of glee though. :)<br>

<b>Pethidine</b> IM feels a lot like a combination of tramadol and codeine at doses of 100 mg and 300 mg respectively. There is a general feeling of well being and slight stimulation but with some of the jitteriness of tramadol (very mild). It's more like a cross between tramadol and codeine. The opiate warmth is present but mild. At my tolerance level, 50 mg of pethidine isn't much, but at least I can feel it...and I'm STILL feeling st0ked about pulling this off! =D<!--   End Body   -->

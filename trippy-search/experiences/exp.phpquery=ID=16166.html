This trip came about rather accidently.  I couldn't find much info on this combination, other than a good report from Toad, and was hesitant to try it at first.  It turned out to be a wonderful, treasured experience, the only +4 (Shulgin scale) I've had.  I hate to even classify it on a scale, as it transcended everything I have ever seen before.  I should also add that I'm not a religious person, so any reference to god made below does not apply to God, Allah, Zeus, or any other cult figure, but to a general concept I have of the nature of existence itself.  The word god is just used because there's no point in trying to explain the unexplainable.  <BR>
<BR>
Set:  Only looking for a medium intensity trip.  100mg of Ketamine normally leaves me very functional, and 50mg of DPT is also a medium/mild trip for me.  I was in a good mood, and had wanted to trip for a while.  <BR>
<BR>
Setting:  Apartment, alone, various things to do there but none were required, it turned out.  <BR>
<BR>
It all started around midnight, when I did a small bump of K and decided to mess around with some graphics programs on the computer for a while.  I continued the K bumps until I estimate I had reached 100mg total, at 2AM, and was feeling just fine.  I was debating adding the DPT to the mix because there wasn't enough Ketamine for anything exciting to happen.  At this point, I did a whippet, and upon coming back from it, something told me I should just do the DPT, so 50mg went up the nose.  Love that burn.  This is when the real trip starts.  <BR>
<BR>
T+0:15 - DPT isn't doing much of anything, and I start to wonder if the Ketamine somehow managed to cancel it out, or that it had degraded badly.  I decided to do another whippet.  When I went into the nitrous land, it was different than before.  I closed my eyes.  A giant, bright orange sigil shaped vaguely like the letter H filled my vision, which then zoomed out and became fractalized, growing outward from the center.  This was, to me, the representation of the split between the light and dark side of personalities, god, the world, and everything else.  During the next 5 minutes or so, I lived through the creation of these sides, the reasoning behind them, and probably 5 different possible event sequences that could lead to this creation.  I was tempted at this point to grab a pen and jot down the words 'god is H' on paper, but decided against it as it wouldn't make sense later if I didn't remember this anyway. <BR>
<BR>
T+0:20 - I snapped out of this state enough to open my eyes and look around.  The room was swirling all around me, and there was a surge of incredible power, warm, loving, glowing, and erotic.  It was as though I had tapped in to the very power grid of existence itself and was being embraced by it.  This 5 minutes had already surpassed anything I had already experienced.  It was overwhelming in power, but there was no fear.  I was still coordinated enough to go to the bathroom, and did so.  Such amazing feelings.  How was I able to take this for granted?   <BR>
<BR>
At this point I lost track, and mostly fell out of time itself.  There weren't what I would classify as standard visuals, just an endless stream of concepts and genetic knowledge that unfolded itself before me.  I remember living through the decisions that would have led to the creations of various religions, both by the human creators of those religions and the gods themselves.  There was an interesting path that centered around the story of the garden of eden, and the decision by that corresponding god, assuming his existence, to set up a situation involving two beings that were mentally wired to seek pleasure, then tempting them with it over threat of 'damnation'.  Another one was along the same lines, involving the invention of hell by the human writers of the bible, as a means of control.  <BR>
<BR>
There were probably around 10 different paths experienced involving the creation of the universe itself, most of which are too foreign to language to properly describe.  One in particular was the fractal concept of our reality or whatever you want to call it being a fragment of an electron in an atom of another universe scaled larger than ours, and the same chain repeating in both ways.  This was one of the parts that was very well visualized, and making the travel between all of those places in so short a time filled me with even more energy the next time I opened my eyes.<BR>
<BR>
I filled another nitrous balloon or two during this time, but I honestly can't say that it even did anything, so it was put away. <BR>
<BR>
The next half of the trip focused on the self, rather than existence.  I imagine that the dissociative effects of the Ketamine were starting to wear off, allowing the concept of the individual mind to be seen again.  It traced many possible paths I could take from this point in life.  I won't go into the personal details too much, but it was very... what's that word?  Enlightening.  :-) One in particular that almost had me laughing out loud was that of me coming out of this experience and forming a church based around DPT.   I followed this timeline for a while before I remembered where I got that idea, and it almost had me laughing out loud.  I can see why that church was formed now, if this is the true light of DPT they experience, although I tend to avoid worshipping a chemical any more than I would a giant invisible all seeing god.  <BR>
<BR>
Througout the trip, it seemed as though the information was being shown to me, rather than thought of, although towards the end I could choose the timeline I wanted to see with ease.   <BR>
<BR>
Everything finally started to wind down around 4AM, and I stayed up until 8 reflecting on the experience.  I'm sure I'll spend the next few months reflecting on all that I learned that night as well.  What this combination brought about is something that I'll treasure forever, and although there are no real words to describe it, I'm greatful to have been able to experience this, and for my ability to live.  I'm writing this report now in case I forget anything, but I have the feeling that I'll remember more and more over the next months, and that there were some great gems of information embedded in those timelines that I can apply towards life, in the most positive way. <BR>
<BR>
Thanks to everyone!<!--   End Body   -->

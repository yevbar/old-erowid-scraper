I recently obtained a bottle of Naturalist Melatonin (3 mg/cap, includes 89mg Calcium, 69mg Phosphorus).  I find myself frequently lying in bed for several hours with a very racing, creative mind, which is good in some ways, but bad in others (obviously lacking sleeping time).  I had heard/read some good things about Melatonin and I decided it would be a good choice for a sleep aide.<br>
<br>
Wrong, so wrong. Well, at least for my case.  The first time I took it, I noticed it's effects come quickly.  It was kind of interesting.  I noticed euphoria, with a sense that, 'God I need to be in bed so badly', while colors seemed to appeal a little bit more, and things kind of had a stoned effect.  Lying in bed I had a bit of an unpleasant feeling, can't describe it too well.<br>
<br>
I took Melatonin three days in a row (the bottle simply says WARNING: Do not take more than 1 tablet within 24 hours, each time was ~24hrs of the last).  I also drank Coffee in the morning 2 of the 3 days as well, which is something definitely to be noted.  On the third day, while I was in class, I suddenly felt like water was coming out of my nose.  Random nose bleed, first time I have ever had one, second time my nose has ever bled.  After thinking for a bit, I concluded it must have been the Melatonin, and Googled it.  I found some sites referring to blood thinning/minor bleeding as a result from Melatonin, so I am pretty sure that Melatonin is involved.<br>
<br>
Yesterday I took Melatonin again (about a week without using Melatonin at all), because I had been falling asleep fairly late, and I needed to wake up at 5:30 AM this morning because I was going fishing.  It worked as it had before, and I fell asleep within about 45 minutes.  I was feeling unpleasant as hell falling asleep though, especially because of the bad memory of my previous nosebleed.  I would have slight pains in my stomach, individual fingers might get sudden bursts of pain, and overall I felt very uncomfortable.  This persisted throughout the next day.  Then later in the day I went to the bathroom and had bloody stool.<br>
<br>
I realize now that taking Melatonin with Caffeine is a bad idea anyways, and why I took it before researching is stupid. Regardless, I found Melatonin to be a little unpleasant and contrary to what I have heard, Melatonin produced blank, black sleep for me, with absolutely no dreaming/recall.<br>
<br>
Good thing I test-drove this sleep aide before using it incase of a bad Shroom trip.  It doesn't even make me fall asleep anyways, just gives me that tired sensation that its 3:30 AM and I’ve been up and about all day and hopes I can find your bed and complete the story.<!--   End Body   -->

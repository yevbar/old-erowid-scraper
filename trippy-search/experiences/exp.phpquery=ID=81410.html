Mephedrone (which I will refer to as 4-MMC herein) is getting more and more popular in my country of residence, especially around student populations where the ease of getting hold of large amounts is leading to it being spread through dealers on campus accommodation. <br>
<br>
After purchasing a 10g shipment from an internet supplier (where it was sold as a plant food), Myself and my housemate, who I shall call Bill, decided to have a night on the drug out of lack of anything else to do. We have both experienced the chemical before, in large amounts. As I will doubtlessly point out later, this chemical has incredible re-dose temptation, so instead of trying to limit ourselves to a certain number of lines, I went ahead and split the 10g into 10 1g wraps and hid 8 of them away. We were both confident that 1g was a safe dose for a 24 hour period, as we had both done considerably higher ones of the same chemical in shorter amounts of time.<br>
<br>
Both Bill and myself are of tall, fairly healthy build, and there were no other drugs effecting us when we set about. I decided to keep a few notes about the experience as this chemical is thus far fairly unknown and under-reported, and there are quite a few fallacys available about its qualities and effects. I myself have moderate insomnia and generally sleep no more than 5 hours a night. I did not expect 4-MMC to let me sleep at all.<br>
<br>
Firstly, the supply we had purchased seemed to be a different quality to that which we have had before. Our previous supply consisted of a slightly yellow powder, with fairly large crystals and was surprisingly oily. It also had a nasty habit of eating through the wraps which I split it up into! This batch was a much finer, white powder that was, thankfully, not oily in the slightest. I am forced to think that our first batch was either not produced correctly or had possibly been cut with something, as it was no-where near as potent as the second one. I will make comparative references to experiences on the first batch to the second one through my report, and I think it is important that people realise there are different qualities of this chemical out there, even if all the websites and dealers claim them to be 'pure'.<br>
<br>
I decided just before we got to it that I would make a report on the effects, and proceeded to carefully weigh out 0.1g for my first line, so we can assume a 100mg dosage with error margins of +-50 mg thanks to my cheapo scales. We both racked up, rolled some notes and let the fun begin. The time was 8pm.<br>
<br>
4-MMC is a pretty nasty chemical to insuffulate. I'm fairly versed with powders, and I'd say the actually experience of snorting it is slightly more painful than that of ketamine, however there is no noticeable 'drip'. Fortunately, the come-up is incredibly fast and soon, the pain doesn't seem to matter anymore. Instantly my brain was hit by wave after wave of unbelievable euphoria - a sensation that I personally found much more pleasurable than MDMA, a drug which 4-MMC is an analogue of and often compared to. Within a few minutes, Bill and myself were talking non-stop. The chemical filled us with so much mental energy, we would change subject 4 times a sentence but still be able to understand each other.<br>
<br>
Despite its speedy effect, I find 4-MMC to be far more relaxing than MDMA. I would not consider choosing 4-MMC over MDMA for a night at a club, but I would definitely recommend it over MDMA for nights in watching TV, talking and small parties. It fills me with mental energy and focus, but I find that, unlike MDMA, I feel no real desire to move around or dance - and the MDMA cliche of wanting to be physically close to other people is completely absent - I'm happy with myself, and I can jump in and out of conversation with others, and spend the rest of the time lying back and just enjoying the euphoria.<br>
<br>
After about 30 minutes, the euphoria starts to fade, and we were left with a speedy buzz. We were still talking quickly, felt energetic and were enjoying the effect, however this is when the urge to re-dose comes in. I weighed up my next like while Bill dosed up. This is where the difference between our first and second batch really became apparent.<br>
<br>
With the first batch we ordered, re-dosing simply returned the euphoria that was present before, but with this bath, it layered itself on top of the already-present speedy feelings and came back even stronger. We got back to talking, watching TV. My concept of time was slowing down, and 30 minutes started feeling like an hour, but this was not what I would consider a negative thing - more a result from being so mentally energised and focused. One of my housemates cooked us a lovely Chinese Stir-Fry. I was not feeling hungry at all, but managed to finish the entire meal without problems.<br>
<br>
The night continued to much the same effect. Every 40 minutes or so, I would weigh out another line. The effects were coming back stronger and stronger. I noticed 7 lines in that my fingers were tingling slightly. 4-MMC is reported to constrict veins. I suddenly became slightly concerned for other side effects. My pulse was measuring a steady 140 bpm, which is much higher than a normal resting pulse but well below danger levels. My tongue was tingling slightly. Bill decided to call it a night and get to bed. Next morning, I'd find out that he finished his wrap before finally getting to sleep at 6am.<br>
<br>
I headed to bed. The euphoric wave from the last hit was wearing off, though I noted that it had been about 15 minutes since the last wrap. 4-MMC has been noted for short-term tolerence, so I figured I should polish off the rest of my wrap and spend the rest of my night surfing the internet and talking to friends - I seemed to have so much to talk about. I weighed out a final 100mg line, and poured the rest (200mg) into a cigarette-paper wrap. I took the line and swallowed the wrap.<br>
<br>
Back to euphoria land, but this time, I was there for the long haul. I had swallowed wraps from our last batch to no real effect. It seemed the active dose for ingestion was much, much higher than for insuffulation so it seemed a waste. This time, however, the slower come-up from the wrap complemented the insuffulated line beautifully. 20 minutes in, when I was expecting the euphoria to fade, it instead came back with somewhat of a vengeance. My vision started to distort slightly, and vibrated. Any white area on my computer screen was overlaid with a subtle but very noticeable pattern of colours and swirling shapes. I did not expect any sort of hallucinations from this drug at all, and it was great fun. I was talking to about 8 different people over MSN and IRC, and typing about 30 lines of text messages in as many seconds in each window. The world around me was somewhat of a blur.<br>
<br>
I did not notice the sun come up. I was not hungry, and strangely, not too thirsty either. The first batch had left me horribly dehydrated at one point, and required massive intakes of water on future takings to prevent the same problem. I was still drinking water fairly reguarly on this outing, but I did not feel this was not bad. I managed to force down a cereal bar, which tasted entirely of sugar. My tounge was numb and slightly swollen and my lips were dry, but I was still euphoric, and somewhat speedy. It still didn't equate into physical energy though - I found myself curled up on the sofa or sitting on my chair upstairs not willing to move around. I also had absolutely no urge to re-dose - perhaps ingestion is the way forward with this chemical!<br>
<br>
This experience did not change until about 5pm, when I suddenly and profoundly crashed. Physically, I became incredibly tired. I was no longer euphoric, but I was nowhere near as exhausted mentally as I was physically. I also had no desire to redose. My mind did not want to rest, but my body sure as hell did. I spent some time in my housemates room and fell into a very light sleep on the end of her bed. She woke me up around 8pm and I decided to try to get some sleep. At this point, I started noticing some weird after effects.<br>
<br>
The nails on my left hand were strangely painful if I stretched my fingers out. I put this down to having it in a funny position when I crashed on my friends bed. My tongue was now very swollen indeed, but it was not painful, and not dangerous. My heart-rate had slowed down to about 70bpm, which seemed somewhat low, and my throat was swollen in the same way it is when I have tonsillitis or a bad sore throat, but again it was not painful at all. My skin was unusually dry, but not exactly uncomfortable except around my lips. Lip balm is a godsend!<br>
<br>
It took me a good hour to get to sleep, and I woke up many times in the night. I get up the next morning not exactly feeling rested, but that is not too unusual for me. The swelling in my throat and my tongue has gone down, thank god, but my tongue still felt slightly weird, and my sense of taste had been somewhat impaired - I could not taste the orange juice I drank with my breakfast at all, and the butter on my toast tasted like water. Also, the nails on both hands were now sore and I noticed a patch of blood under both thumbnails. This pain only lasted a few hours after getting up. I had some muscular pain around my jaw and other parts of my body, such as my neck and thighs. I've experienced similar effects on a comedown from MDMA, however mentally there were no issues at all - not even a headache. I was as focused and sharp as I was normally, and this really was a comedown that I would be happy to work on.<br>
<br>
It took another 24 hours for these after-effects to clear up, and I think people should be careful declaring 4-MMC comedown-free, however this was a fairly large dose combined with a long period without sleep. It was a positive experience, the euphoria was unlike anything that I've felt on any other drug, and I'd say that it justifies the groggy feeling the day afterward. However, I will attempt, from now on, to make sure I have some downer at hand at the end of a night to make sure I get some sleep, and I'd advise others to do the same.<!--   End Body   -->

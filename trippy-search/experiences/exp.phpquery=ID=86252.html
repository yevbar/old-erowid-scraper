I decided to try a mix of two psilocin analogs: 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MiPT.  I felt that Miprocin's strange come-up and mental feeling and Psilacetin's spiritual wholeness would complement each other nicely.  I have done 4-AcO-DMT probably about 7 times, and 4-HO-MiPT about 4 times.  I weighed out about 6mg of 4-AcO-DMT, and 6mg of 4-ho-MiPT, then combined them in the same capsule.  The capsule weighed out to be about 12mg, so I figured I didn't lose any or much in the process.<br>
<br>
I had been trying to trip for a couple of weeks, and my boyfriend (D) who I am always with wasn't so sure himself.  I had waited for him day after day, but this particular day I really found myself wanting to trip no matter what.  I felt that I needed to go with my own agenda this time and just trip without him.  Writing about this situation is important for this trip report because it influenced the way my trip unfolded.  I felt bad about my decision of tripping without him, but I suppose part of why I did it was related to my need to know that I could make my own choices in regards to our relationship.  I could tell that he was upset about my decision too, because about 10-15 minutes after I dropped he said some hurtful things to me.  I started to get really worried thinking that maybe I would end up having a 'guilt trip' and the experience would leave me feeling horrible.  I'd had a 'guilt trip' some months before on mushrooms, worrying about him, and I don't want to experience that kind of anguish again or make him feel bad, either.<br>
<br>
I ran upstairs thinking that maybe I wouldn't be able to handle being around him, but as I sat on the bed and started to feel the first signs of my normal consciousness drifting in and out, I began feeling bad about my behavior thinking that I should try to resolve things with him as soon as I could.  So I went back downstairs and started talking to him.  He seemed a bit more calm by now, and I sat next to him as he was on the computer.  I remember noticing the ads on the computer screen, and their ridiculousness made me crack up laughing, but all the same they made me feel sorry for humanity.<br>
<br>
I was having trouble paying attention to what he was doing: showing me some song from his past by Blink 182 (Adam's Song).  The sound of the song made me feel very nostalgic and kind of sad.  Feelings of contempt and uncomfortableness crept over me, as I tend to feel get those feelings about D's past.  Those feelings, however, were quickly overtaken by sadness for D and how he had to experience those things.  He was placed into his life and didn't choose to experience those things, I told myself.  I was glad when we decided to go outside and D packed a bowl.<br>
<br>
Sitting by the pool, I felt myself being enveloped by the air around me because it was unusually humid.   This made me feel that I was already underwater, but I didn't feel like actually swimming.  I just put my feet into the pool and created beautiful ripples that wove around each other and interacted with one another.  It was about an hour since dropping at this point, and I had been feeling the 4-HO-MiPT for a while.  Now I was beginning to feel the 4-AcO-DMT as well, or so my mind told me at least, and the feeling of consciousness actually *did* feel different than either 4-HO-MiPT or 4-AcO-DMT by themselves.  This presence was more inquisitive and prying, but somehow still had feelings of calmness washing over me.  The body feeling of this trip continued to be especially prominent throughout; I could feel myself flowing and vibrating at all times, yet it was very comfortable and sometimes ecstatic.  I went on to smoke some weed that D had packed into a bong.  After smoking that bowl, I gradually felt the intensity of my trip increase significantly.<br>
<br>
We went inside and D left the room.  I sat against a comfy leather chair (on the floor against the chair, not on the actual chair) and I heard voices begin to chant some words... I caught the words 'midst' and 'turning'.  The voices all sounded a bit like mine and the same, but overlapping in certain times and not having any set pattern.  The voices shifted into saying 'In the midst of turning, turning, turning...'... I sank into this sound, this feeling, this chair.  My body was still feeling very liquid; flowing.  It was impossible to not feel 'comfortable', because I felt that I shifted myself according to the objects that were around me more so than manipulating the objects in order to be comfortable, like I do most of the time in day to day life.<br>
<br>
When D turned on the television, I became unnerved and went to lay on the floor.  I called for him to come over to me, and when he finally did and I said to him, 'Sorry if I'm a boring tripper,' as I was basically laying on his basement floor unable to bring myself to even get up.  I still felt like I was being submerged underwater most of the time, but at times I would find myself with a clear head, only to be pushed back underwater seconds later.  This trip was a lot like LSD in this way; it came in waves.  D and I talked about our relationship, his problems and mine, our views on suicide and on how we felt about each other.  I couldn't stop crying because I sometimes get very emotional about issues such as these while tripping.  There were a couple of things that I refused to talk about at that point because I knew they would make me unbearably sad.  D understood and laid with me.  I felt that we were universes reaching out to one another.<br>
<br>
We stopped talking so much and I drifted into a psychedelic realm that I haven't been as deep into since my first 4-AcO-DMT trip.  I felt that I had been drawn into or woven into (not visually; just the feeling itself) some sort of place that felt so cosmic and out there yet so familiar.  I love that feeling... I remember feeling a strange sensation that I had split into many different spiritual peaces and was being 'passed around' the room.  Shards of different ideas and memories moved through my consciousness.  One thing that I remember was a closed-eye visual that looked like an old movie, where there was a girl or woman throwing photographs into the air.  It had a nostalgic feel to it.  These wandering thoughts got a bit overwhelming at times, especially as I visited some of my biggest fears (example: concentration camps) but I was thankfully able to let go.  I recognize this as I separated the image/concept from the feelings that surrounded it.  They, and then their visual representations, shifting and changing, drifted off into that peaceful, distant realm that I was indeed SO thankful for.  I reveled in this for what seemed like a very long time...<br>
<br>
D ended up leaving at some point, and I felt incomplete and jarred as he left.  I felt that I could barely get up; my body felt so strange and like it was not my own at all.  Every tiny movement I made seemed to cause ripples throughout my body, which was interesting but I preferred to just lay and move around on the floor.  At one point when D was touching me, I would experience visuals that matched the ways in which he touched me.  They reminded me of music visualizers or something, and they gave me other strange sensations that I can't really describe.  I suppose the only word for it would be synaesthesia.  When I did walk, I felt like I was floating through the room.  I could not really feel/differentiate between the details of the smaller parts of my body working together to make me walk.  Here comes in the notion that I am indeed always on autopilot.<br>
<br>
When it had been a few hours after I had dropped, I began to feel a little more clearheaded and started feeling a little bit hyper, but then D's hyperness 'overwrote' mine.  I felt that he was acting a bit strange, perhaps because he was still feeling bad that I had tripped without him.  I wrote down some random stream of consciousness thoughts I'd been having:<br>
<br>
'Let's lead a false life on _______ Drive,<br>
feeding the makers of this universal test.<br>
So why not devise some tests of our own?<br>
I'm sure the results will impress.'<br>
and <br>
'The butterfly in my mouth is only for show, flapping forth thought' <--I have no idea.><br>
<br>
I smoked another bowl from the bong and then took my iPod into the other room to listen to music as D wasn't being very talkative at this point.  I put on a Prometheus track, The Logic of the Polyphonic.  The distorted voice at the beginning of the song seemed more disturbing and interesting than usual, and I noticed so many new sounds that I'd never noticed before, sometimes sounds that seemed like they were made just to 'fuck with you'.  I experienced such synaesthesia with this song, but the overall mood to it was just plain... cliche.  That's the only word I can even use to describe it: cliche.<br>
<br>
After some time, I couldn't take this anymore, I was experiencing sci-fi visuals at this point that seemed like they were out of a child's movie, however maybe a little more disturbing.  I actually felt like the music was impeding upon my trip at this point, believe it or not.  I tried listening to different song and it sounded just annoying to me, so I decided to turn off all the music and just listen to the sounds of the house creaking, the air conditioner turning on and off, cars speeding by and other unidentifiable sounds in the distance.  This was a lot more interesting than listening to music; the sounds I was hearing now were already creating a sort of symphony and it had so many different facets of emotion!  Also, at some point during this time I felt the presence around me of some sort of atypical female.  She seemed to have a sexual presence, and I thought about my own sexuality (I normally don't see myself as much of a sexual being).  Around this time I felt such an encompassing and euphoric feeling.  I thought about nothing other than how wonderful this feeling was...<br>
<br>
As I started to come down more (about 4-5 hours after dropping), I started talking to D more and realized that everything was fine between us.  I actually felt pretty physically uncomfortable though after a certain point, in contrast to the 'melting into my surroundings' comfortable feeling I'd been experiencing.  I couldn't stop clenching my jaw and my whole body felt pretty tense.  I took a Klonopin to relieve myself of this feeling and got to sleep.  As I drifted into sleep, there were a few times where I had strange sensations and became disoriented, so I'd put my head up and look around the room.  It was strange; the room looked a lot different and I was seeing more actual 'visual distortions' than I had throughout the bulk of the trip.  But maybe that's because I had trouble keeping my eyes open throughout the duration of the trip as I'd felt so dreamy.<br>
<br>
I think that 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MiPT together made for an interesting synergy.  Based on the experiences I've had in the past with either of these tryptamines, I feel that if I had taken 12mg of either substance alone, the trip wouldn't have been as intense or fulfilling.  I feel that the 4-HO-MiPT made for the mental 'intensity' and the deepness of the trip was possibly attributed by the 4-AcO-DMT.  It is interesting to ponder and I shall never know, but I definitely liked this combination and I would recommend it.  I had a wholesome trip in pretty much every way, and I have never experienced synaesthesia quite like this before.<br>
<br>
After the trip, I found myself thinking a lot about peoples' differences in perception, social experiments and ways to just be strange to other people for fun (not at anyone's expense, of course).<!--   End Body   -->

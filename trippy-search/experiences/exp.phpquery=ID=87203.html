and it's well-spaced<br>
'Sunday, March 22 - 2009'<br>
so i haven't lit since <br>
election night<br>
=========================================<br>
I was baptized under the showerhead<br>
I was sewn upon the ground<br>
<br>
there is not one moment with you that i do not receive<br>
some intimate information about my nature or what my body is requesting<br>
the in in in in's are beginning to shuffle mmm wmmm mm<br>
<br>
it is god's garden,<br>
it's the angel's hedgerows<br>
<br>
it spurs me with dense rushes telling me to stay from technology<br>
this time I'll break it<br>
it shows me my placement from all surrounding angles<br>
=====================================================<br>
it gives me a new eye for the natural world<br>
like a dead man usurping an infant's face to view a field once again<br>
it is lifting oneself out of Hades in order to vview the bluue pink and yellow once morre<br>
the smile carries it out<br>
and Mephistopheles or whoever pulls you back in again<br>
-=================--=================----<br>
it disarms and de-panels the ideal<br>
like blown solar plates<br>
it is the satellite of the world<br>
you'll stay in the dark room and still hear the static telepathy<br>
you'll still feel the hot sun like it's being sent back in on a discus of light<br>
--------------------------------====<br>
it inspires capitulation<br>
it is a one-word judgment without malice,<br>
 just peeeeeeling the answers back<br>
 like a sticker's back<br>
it is understanding all<br>
-----===========================<br>
it is turning my body to thousands of leaves twistling down and off a tree's bark<br>
it is becoming the leaf-pile and being blown into liquid propeller leaves<br>
it is all of fall's colours surrounded with deep lush greens<br>
it is the palm frond cocoon<br>
set at perfect temperature<br>
it is 'WHAT IS IT THAT REALLY MATTERS?' in Hollywood's best god voice<br>
and recognizing that is a new sensation in the skin<br>
<br>
----------------------------===<br>
-------my whole<br>
 system is ------------===<br>
reporting--------------------------------==<br>
----------------------==<br>
-----===<br>
----------------==<br>
<br>
it is nature's last defense against the unnatural<br>
it's the ghost in the highway<br>
it is the manual (instructions)<br>
shifting to manual (setting)<br>
<br>
it is the ever-reclining race car<br>
the roller-coaster network of neurons<br>
it is the limb-loggering high-jump<br>
<br>
it is a warm vat for the satyr<br>
it is the lei garland necklace that you get off the plane in Hawaii<br>
<br>
it is the ecstatic, imperfect mess<br>
spliced frames<br>
unsequenced until you can cut-and-paste the moments and truly live them<br>
not reading the instructions to the nerves and cells<br>
<br>
all in-between thoughts have been banished for the constant flourish<br>
it is a tactile heaven gym-court<br>
know that you don't<br>
have to live five seconds in the future of each fragment<br>
<br>
it is all the drapery being shook and thrown off and down the street<br>
IT IS THE FIRE WITH THE FINGER SNAP.<br>
it is placing your mind in the CD tray ----and ACTUALLY GETTING TO LISTEN.-----<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------============<br>
===============================================================================<br>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------========<br>
realizing there are more channels devoted to you than you can ever flip the cards on<br>
<br>
it is that touch-and-go foreign language you keep threatening to invent<br>
it's getting a brand new bellows to breathe with<br>
stomping down stairs by the stained glass <br>
up by the church organ<br>
and it's knowing EXACTLY how to play that church organ<br>
 and getting to play it your way at 7am for a well-lit church congregation<br>
taking the top down off of the cathedral<br>
then being seated at a plate<br>
 of sunny side up eggs afterward<br>
all yellow and white<br>
just like me <br>
because I'm pure<br>
AM I? mostly<br>
<br>
it is knowing the music-tracks on every incense stick <br>
and smiling knowingly to your friend<br>
when you come across it in your record collection<br>
it means getting to share that laugh, <br>
knowing you're both in two completely different places<br>
 grabbing hands over great distances<br>
<br>
it is a profound thought<br>
 being served to you every day at the same time<br>
in your cranberry purple, yellow-covered reform school<br>
it is every noon a school class trip<br>
to some fond, vague, Austrian meadowland<br>
you'll be seated upfront<br>
with your pupils pushed back<br>
<br>
leaping at lilies like cheap puppets<br>
'SHOWING THE DOG HIS OWN FACE'<br>
<br>
it is the wood of the cabin and<br>
THE TORSION OF THE SLUG HEADING DOWN THE STEEL<br>
with no salt around<br>
------------=====================---------------<br>
all blue green now<br>
its the cut leather swaying on native clothing<br>
the gentle breeze<br>
--------------============--------------<br>
it is the nerve-ending dance which no composer has written for yet<br>
no one has tried<br>
then you realize nothing decent has been done yet<br>
  BUT IIT WIILLL!<br>
<br>
it is getting to swim in the crystal lake with its light-red-yellow-blue divers and<br>
gemmed stalactites<br>
<br>
it is the whole wealth of personalities known<br>
at your fondest perusal<br>
it is 'REMEMBER THAT BEAUTIFUL FACE THAT YOU NEVER LOVED?'<br>
it is falling on your back on your seat letting nerves charge<br>
electrified in jolts<br>
it is letting things fly at full mast<br>
it is getting the soul's autograph and going home on the bus of life happy<br>
it is foot-peddling the ceiling like an infant<br>
rolling-ovrrr like a bohemian jaguar right after a rest in the jungle's core<br>
<br>
is it sparking all the kindling on the smile<br>
it is fine ways of transmitting insights into humanity<br>
<br>
it's moving like you can breathe underwater<br>
<br>
IT IS THE FROSTY BOB-SLED RUN OUT<br>
                  into the verdant valley<br>
it is more fun than you can record<br>
far better than any mass experience<br>
<br>
===============================================--------=============----------<br>
--------------=================---------------==============--------------=========<br>
it is always telling you to leap to your feet<br>
fall back into a pillow if you want to have a downtime<br>
<br>
you'll find it's also all the stripes on the pillow come off on your back<br>
it is all those psychedelic viewfinders from childhood<br>
slights of the optics<br>
<br>
thrills from those magic eye posters<br>
with the hidden image that none of the teachers could see<br>
or a magic mirror which reflects us all<br>
<br>
it is the third-eye chromatrope<br>
it is visionary company<br>
============================================--------==================<br>
<br>
it is the prismatic train taking looonnnng leeeaaaps off the track<br>
taking higher strides each time<br>
<br>
it is anything that prevents your father from talking<br>
it is the FF>> wedding to post-ritual speech<br>
it is leaping on the plush chair savage-like<br>
and throwing a leg over it carelessly like an angel on a tuft of cloud<br>
it is stretching your legs and doing chores that would've bored you<br>
exercises that can't begin to exert you<br>
art that spindles out of you in a daze<br>
part of the nameless, but <br>
un-ashed hours<br>
========================================<br>
----------------------------------------<br>
it is nothing like its been made out to be<br>
you should be ashamed of calling it anything but what it is<br>
it's bedfeathers without concerns,<br>
it is a re-connector...<!--   End Body   -->

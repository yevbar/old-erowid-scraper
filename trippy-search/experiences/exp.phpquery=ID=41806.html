<!--   Start Body   -->


I was experienced with this combination on a few occasions, and the other times I did it was similar, though only in some aspects. <br>
<br>
My day started off with smoking some kif, which was from a pure sativa, followed by a hitting a few nitrous oxide canisters. This went exceptionally well. <br>
<br>
A few hours later, my friend and I proceeded to repeat the process with the addition of salvia. It felt like a train hitting me, an extraordinarily fast rush and then the experience itself felt as if I was in a carnival almost. Everything was real but it was a 'fake' reality. I was not imagining this either. Everything was clear and sharp and normal in a sense, I was basically on the borderline of breaking through. It was also very fragile, and I had the potential of having a very bad trip. Luckily, I did not. <br>
<br>
We watched a movie, by the end of which the effects of the salvia wore off. I went home and this is where the real trip happened. I arrived home, two hours after the original ingestion of the drugs. I am still high but under no influence of the previous substances. Another hour passes before I began to experiment alone. I had a rather large bowl of kif. I was by all standards high at the end of it. I then had Skyy vodka to dull the effects of the body and help me 'focus' (as much as one can focus on alcohol) my mind.  <br>
<br>
I turned on some nice 'calm' music and began to wait 15 minutes until I began to peak, before hitting the salvia. I packed a small amount, with some difficulty. The alcohol was kicking in, I felt the buzz and slightly inebriated. The salvia was burned for 2 seconds by a standard BIC, sucked in, and held in for about 20 seconds. I placed down the bowl and my lighter. I sat down, put on my headphones, and started up some visualizations in Winamp and waited for the show to start. <br>
<br>
And start it did. I immediately felt the 'salvia wind' as I describe it, a feeling where my mind begins to get torn apart from my body. After another minute, I was totally under the grip of salvia. My mind was trapped in my body but free. I felt all the controls to my body. My mouth, my tongue, my hands, each had its own place in my body and I felt the individual controls. It was very interesting. I was still 'aware' of what was REALLY happening, but I felt that more interesting things I could see if I traveled out of my body. I had to 'step' over the controls of my body. In fact, last time during this process, I accidentally activated my voice and began mumbling to myself. I almost spoke, because I tripped over my voice 'controls.' A good way to picture this is the way you are now, in a big room with controls scattered everywhere and a door somewhere. <br>
<br>
I locked my body into a sitting position and left. I became one with the visualizations, I understood what it was to be infinite. I realized what reality was. I cannot really put it into words. It was definitely an enlightening experience. This feeling pursued for about 30 minuets, probably due to alcohol. After the feeling wore off I was simply high/mildly intoxicated. I went to sleep. I slept wonderfully. The next day I woke up feeling slightly burnt, but it went away quickly after I reflected on my trip. <br>
<br>
I feel now that my highs, no matter what they are off of, will be much more personal and meaningful. I will understand much more. Addition of any other drugs into this experience would definitely make this a much more intense experience. I will definitely try this again when I am ready. Perhaps nitrous will be added.<!--   End Body   -->

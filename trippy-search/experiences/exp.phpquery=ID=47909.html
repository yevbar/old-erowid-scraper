<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Warning: Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</FONT><br>
<br>
So I had nothing to do tonite, I had also used up my last bit of weed and wasn't picking up a new bag till tomorrow. No liquer in the house and nothing else to fuck me up.<br>
<br>
I decided to try some Computer Duster. This was my second time doing it. The first time I only had one or two small hits out of an almost empty can (most of it was used the correct way on my keyboard).<br>
<br>
I took about 4 hits off the new can. I held each in for about 20 seconds before blowing out. Nothing happened for a while, but soon the feelings I had felt before started to appear. Fuzzy feeling in my forhead and my vision blurred. I didn't notice any darkened or tunnel vision because my room is pretty dark and I only have my TV and computer turned on. Soon though, some new things started to happen. I could hear my heartbeat perfectly and I could feel the air around me. I could feel my existance and everything else's existance pulsating through my body and my head.<br>
<br>
I started to hear a droning buzzing sound along with the pouding. I lost control of my neck muscles and my head bobbed back and forth while I moaned and laughed at myself and the experience. My voice sounded a bit deeper, but not as deep as in the other reports I've read on Erowid. I took 2 more hits and held them in.<br>
<br>
The droning got louder and the vibrations of existance became stronger. Family Guy was on, and I stared at the tv, but I didn't really see the show. My eyes were open, but I didn't see anything through them. I didn't need to see. I could feel vibrations of the world around me. I sat in the chair for about 2 minutes like this, and then started to come down.<br>
<br>
As I'm writing this, I still feel a bit light-headed. It was a good experience and I'm glad I did it. However, I dont think I'll be doing it that much as it obviously does some brain damage, and I dont want to end up drooling in a padded room when i turn 30.<!--   End Body   -->

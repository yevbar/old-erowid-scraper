Well I could safely call myself a drug geek.  Biochemistry and the interaction of psychoactives with the human body is something that has always fascinated me, so I find myself reading online all the time to learn as much as I can.<br>
<br>
Despite my interest in drugs, I am by no terms addicted to anything. I enjoy experimenting with various substances, partially because I'm curious to see my own body's reaction to the drug, and partially because it's fun. I have used quite few substances and always make sure I know what I'm doing before I use them.  I was and am still 17 years old and quite knowledgeable and careful when it comes to new drugs. This having been said, I made a huge mistake with Dexedrine.<br>
<br>
My friend L and I decided to skip school one day (we are both seniors) and hang out at his house.  Since my school is big into random drug testing for athletes (I am an athlete and therefore I am drug tested), we weren’t able to use anything which would stay in our systems long enough to show up on any test we may be given. This ruled out marijuana and we had no alcohol left from the last time we drank, so we decided to just chill and watch some South Park, etc.  At about 12:30 pm, I was upstairs in his kitchen looking around for some food while L was in the basement playing some computer game.  I saw a prescription bottle on his counter and read the label simply to test my own knowledge and see if I knew what it was.  The label said: Dexedrine 10 mg SA. Given my somewhat excessive knowledge of psychoactives, I knew Dexedrine was a simple brand name for dextroamphetamine and that SA was an abbreviation for sulfate, which is often used to time-release medication.  <br>
<br>
I was fully aware that the medication was speed and that it is prescribed for ADHD and narcolepsy. I even knew how it interacted with the brain to release stores of dopamine and some levels of norepinephrine and I could (oddly enough) tell you the chemical formula of amphetamine and even its sister chemical methamphetamine. But being cautious, I got on L's computer and went on a drug information website and various other pharmaceutical websites in search of information.  It was the lack of information on recreational use that threw me off.  If I had only read the drug information website I may have been fine because though amphetamine doesn’t have a dosage page, a strong dose of methamphetamine is listed at 50+ mgs.  Knowing that the extra methyl group only made it more fat soluble, I could safely assume that amphetamine and methamphetamine dosages were very similar.<br>
<br>
So at about 1:00 pm I proceeded to take 6 Dexedrine containing a total of 60 mgs of dextroamphetamine sulfate. At this point L came upstairs to see what I was doing and suggested we insufflate (snort) some.  Once again I was cautious because I knew the onset of the speed would not come for an hour or two since I had simply ingested them.  So I got back online and looked on some pharmaceutical websites and saw that some doctors prescribed up to 60 mgs a day for people with severe ADHD.  Knowing this and knowing that it was time release convinced me that to really get the high I should insufflate a few.<br>
<br>
Big mistake.<br>
<br>
I went into his basement and we broke open, crushed, and snorted about 7 total of a different prescription of 15 mg Dexedrine capsules.  I ended up insufflating another 60 mgs.  Now it was 2:40 pm and we knew his siblings would be home soon and we didn’t want them to know we had skipped so I drove down (really though, don't drive when you are high, it is really stupid) to a secluded gravel trail and we just chilled there talking.  <FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</FONT> At this point the snorted speed was in full effect and the stuff I ate was finally starting to take effect. I felt really really good.<br>
<br>
The first thing I noticed was the great euphoric kind of elated feeling I had.  It felt as if I was on top of the world.  It's hard to explain, but it was more of a mental thing then a physical thing. I didn't feel too different physically, besides the ridiculous amount of energy and a tingle feeling every now and then, but mentally, I was not only thinking quickly and clearly, but I felt amazingly happy just to be sitting there talking. I understood these feelings to be the effects of the dopamine and norepinephrine, but it was amazing.  <br>
<br>
'Don't hang around a speed-freak cuz they will talk your ear off'... well two people on speed talking makes for a really awesome, amazingly long conversation.  I had thoughts flying at me from everywhere, and I felt like I just had to say everything I thought of.  Time flew by though, before we knew it was 4:30. So we both got out to go to the bathroom in the woods.  When I looked down, my member was shrunk to the size of a pee.  Weird feeling, since speed is a sexual stimulant but also causes temporary impotence.  We both had the same problem so it was nothing to worry about.  <br>
<br>
I had done about twice as much as him and we were both feeling great so we talked until 6:00 when I drove him home and went back to my house. I had no appetite and decided that instead of continuing to make my parents suspicious, I would go up to his house and chill some more. I did and at 11:00 pm I came back home because I had school the next day.  I still couldn't slow my brain down, I had a million thoughts flying at me and I couldn't stop them.  Still felt great all the way until about 3:00am (I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep), when the occasional tingle spread across my entire body and I went almost entirely numb.<br>
<br>
My friend was still awake too, but he was not having a hard time like I was.  My pulse was still racing at about 140 (which isn't amazingly fast but it had been there for about 11 hours) and my body was numb and the thoughts were still flying at me.  I quite literally thought I might die.  I had no energy because I had crashed and hadn't eaten since noon.  The only fortunate thing was that time seemed to go very quickly. I stayed home 'sick' the next day and felt fairly miserable. I couldn't eat until about 12:00pm and I didn't sleep again until 11:00pm.<br>
<br>
The one interesting thing was before I went to sleep on the second day (the day I had stayed home 'sick') I experienced some mental confusion and open eye hallucinations.  I kept thinking I was in L's basement and seeing human-like shadows crawling along my walls. After I had slept and ate, I felt much better and I haven't noticed any residual effects of the amphetamines.<br>
<br>
The good parts were amazing and the bad parts were terrifying.  I have since insufflated Dexedrine three other times, the next time with only 45 mgs, which gave a euphoric feeling and after about 8 or 9 hours I experienced the numbness which again was scary but only lasted about 10 minutes. Then I snorted 30 mgs the next time which gave a mild euphoric feeling and little to no crash or numbness.<br>
<br>
And the last time was today, when at 11:00am I snorted 45 mgs.  It made me talkative and euphoric for about 8 hours and I have yet to experience any numbness.  That is how I have had the concentration to write this lengthy submission.<br>
<br>
My suggestions for amphetamines:<br>
<br>
1. Know how much I need to get the feeling I want (generally 45 - 60 mgs insufflated for myself)<br>
2. Have someone with me to talk to or to help me if I tweak a little too much<br>
3. Don't become addicted - set limits and if I go over them, quit<br>
4. Don't use speed after 1:00 even if I am snorting because I will have trouble sleeping.<br>
5. Be especially careful your first time until you have established your limits<br>
6. Don't drive<br>
7. Use them intelligently<br>
<br>
Follow those rules and you may enjoy the drug without having a bad trip or letting yourself become addicted.<!--   End Body   -->

These are summaries of various salvia experiences using single hits of 10x and 20x <br>
(I can't tell the difference and don't remember what extract matches what experiences)<br>
<br>
The first time may have been the most terrifying, which is understandable, I think.<br>
<br>
Someone else who had used Salvia and wanted to observe the effect second hand, paid for a gram of 10x for me.  I took one hit and about three seconds later (before exhaling) the room turned blue and orange, extended 70 feet into the distance and began taunting me, hysterical laughter and drooling ensued.  Then a rolodex of every alternate dimension version of me started to rotate through my body, I felt all 170 pounds of each of these selves slamming into and through me, I had already forgotten that I had consumed a psychoactive drug and began to panic, thinking I would have to wait for all of these thousands of selves to pass through me before the rolodex completed its rotation and my regular self returned, hysterical screaming and lurching about ensued, which subsided as I returned to the normally colored, regular sized version of the room.<br>
<br>
On another occasion I smoked in an alley in a snowstorm in Minneapolis.  The immediate urge was to run, I felt strong and confident, drooling ensued.  Hollywood robots flanked the alleyway, and real, evolving organic robots (trees and telephone poles) were there too, like in a museum of natural history, with each stage of evolution represented.  I felt the consciousness of the city of Minneapolis flirting with me and trying to impress me, and saw her shifting buildings around so that they faced the alley and I would see only her best things.  Snowflakes seemed to drift through me and made me feel stronger.<br>
<br>
I was smoking on some railroad tracks just outside of Minneapolis.  My vision became limited to a small area about one hundred yards away and everything outside this area appeared as a bow legged man dressed in green, who dissipated into a birds-eye view of green canoeists, sloshing about in fractal patterns, drooling ensued.  I did not like this man, he seemed to say “you are trapped forever.” but I realized that he was my coat so I took him off and felt happy to be free.  Unfortunately, the green man was replaced by a red man, who also fractured into canoeists, but this man was my shirt and I removed him as well.  Now I was shirtless and screaming, it was a cold night in January, but the cold seemed to sustain me.  My companion on this trip seemed to grow afraid of me and ran into some high grass, which seemed to me a challenge to follow.  I was overwhelmed in the grass, which stabbed at my bare torso, I attempted to reason with the grass, but negotiations with plants often fail I have found and so I retreated to the rails again where objective reality was waiting for me.<br>
<br>
I was smoking in a strange suburban brownfield dumping ground adjacent to a corporate campus just outside of Minneapolis.  I turned into a (drooling) professor of human/robot history (unfortunately, as a professor my characteristic instinct was to continue smoking from the pipe in my hand)  I saw the sleek buildings of the corporate campus as human fueled robot monsters, imagined an embarrassed robot remarking that the Mona Lisa looked a little silly and painting over it, and saw in a light near a path that I had gotten to a recreation of Francisco Goya’s “Third of May” Featuring blades of grass lined up in front of a robot firing squad.  <br>
<br>
Maybe I was wrong and the last time was the most terrifying.  I was smoking near a rural highway, which made me nervous, so to compensate I decided to tie myself to an 800 pound metal sculpture, y’know, for safety.  I never quite made it to the realm of my previous trips, I didn’t even drool.  In desperation I tried smoking more salvia (something I had usually been too far gone to do.)  I began feeling some physical effects, but more than anything I felt betrayed, here are my thoughts in writing immediately after getting back into the house:  <br>
<br>
Like going through the motions of sex, with someone who would really rather be somewhere else.  They were pushing me around, barely trying to hide the filament wire and gaffer’s tape.  But this is a truly beautiful place, whatever the case.<br>
<br>
I posted these because I have found it reassuring reading other peoples experiences online, I marvel at the similar sensations I recognize when reading or listening about other folks’ experiences.<!--   End Body   -->

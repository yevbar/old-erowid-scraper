I was alone in the basement in northern Scandinavia. It was mid-winter and I was coming to terms with being single again. Fairly lonely, I suppose, but not miserable and just bored for something to do. The nearest neighbour was half a mile down the road, the snow was almost 3 feet deep and the sky crystal clear with sparkling stars though snow forecast. As always, I took a few notes and write down what I had taken (just in case).<BR>
<BR>
After a several glasses of red wine, I decided to take the stuff (orally). It was from a good supplier and had a not unpleasant lemony-chemical taste that dissolved easily on the tongue. It was just after 7:00 PM.<BR>
<BR>
I could detect something within 10 minutes but it took 1 hour for the full effects to come on. Very alert and happy with mild grinding of teeth. With more red wine, a very pleasant euphoria developed and I chatted online for hours. I never felt as edgy as with speed and it felt almost like mild MDMA. It started snowing slightly in bone dry air, and I spent hours watching the beautiful flakes land and then evaporate.<BR>
<BR>
I didn't feel at all sleepy or washed out, as I do after speed or E and carried on all night. Went to get my hair cut the next afternoon and felt very positive and fine - was chatting with everyone, didn't seem to look odd in the mirror. Next evening, early night and slept like a log. No comedown the next day, even felt better than normal.<BR>
<BR>
Summary<BR>
<BR>
Seems milder and longer lasting than speed. I got no unpleasant come-down afterwards. Will certainly try again, if I get the chance. I didn't have my blood pressure meter with me, but didn't seem to go particularly high.<BR>

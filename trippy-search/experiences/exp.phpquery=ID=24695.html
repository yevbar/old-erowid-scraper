I planned to experiment with this chemical at a high dose after trying 2.5mg 1 week prior and experiencing very little effect. I chose a dosage of 15mg because I had a friend that had taken that amount over the course of 12 hours with no dangerously toxic effects.<BR>
<BR>
     I was at my house, by myself, for the majority of this trip, and had gotten a good nights sleep the night before. I was in a pleasant and anticipatory mood leading up to the dosing.<BR>
<BR>
12:54pm - Fasted for the last 13 hours. Ingested 15mg 5MEO-AMT powder dissolved in 1.5 ml distilled water which I mixed with cranberry juice.<BR>
<BR>
1:36pm - Nausea. Distinct body change. Noticeable in back muscles and jaw. Increased sensitivity to contrasts of light and dark. I feel a need to excrete or vomit, though I don't really want to.<BR>
<BR>
1:45pm - Body chills. Very sensitive to temperature.<BR>
<BR>
2:01pm - Quiet sounds are much louder to me.<BR>
<BR>
3:47pm - Watched a movie. Had a bout of diarrhea earlier. Colors. Walls not bleeding, but crawling images on my mind. Vomiting would probably feel good, but I don't like to vomit.<BR>
<BR>
Definite mildly euphoric head change is evident. Communication is fun. I began thinking about things that have been on my mind recently and feeling very pleasant.<BR>
<BR>
?? - I just felt exceedingly like a personification of death.<BR>
<BR>
?? - Wow. It's overpowering at some moments, but I can still function. I've had two phone conversations that went well. One was fun. One was scary; I had to run for it.<BR>
<BR>
?? - Wow. This is some strong shit. Yoyo baton wand oscillations of sound that moved on controllable tracks. [describing an aural hallucination]<BR>
<BR>
6pm - Wow. I have never had something so in control and out of control simultaneously. I feel precise. Moving and stretching isolated muscles feels good. There is a heightened awareness of my body.<BR>
<BR>
	sidenote: If I were to ingest much more than this I would probably need a babysitter to regulate fluid intake. I have been very thirsty because of the diarrhea. I feel stripped.<BR>
<BR>
	I have  a very shaky grasp on communicating with others. I wonder how I sound. Conversations I'm having in my head are going on on paper at the same time and I am getting confused.<BR>
<BR>
7pm - I've misplaced one glass of water already. The trip is more comparative to mescaline than to mushrooms. 'Noone ever really knows,' seems to be a recurrent theme. I have a much greater ability to describe this trip as it happens than I have encountered with other hallucinogens. I'm finding more than typical meaning in words I am writing. I became fixated with 'Being Still'...<BR>
<BR>
8pm - Spilled my first glass of water.<BR>
Thoughts:<BR>
	It was really nice. It made me cry.<BR>
	Some people are so very carefully wrapped up in themselves that it would take a long time to make them unwrap.<BR>
<BR>
9pm? - I got dressed and walked two blocks to a local coffee shop. It was very hot, and I dressed a little too warmly for the weather. The environment on a typical summer evening in a residential neighborhood was very distracting and almost overwhelming. The crowd at the coffee shop was very alert and chaotic, and I experienced some paranoia. I felt it best to not stay long, and only spoke to one person.<BR>
<BR>
10pm - Still going very strong. Visuals. Increased awareness. Very thirsty. Feeling slightly tired.<BR>
	-Earlier I felt as if I were in a container of no sight, no sound; echoing through me. I was moving in and out of these chambers on the x, y and z axes.<BR>
<BR>
1am?? - started drinking scotch to go to sleep. Still very 'up'.<BR>
<BR>
3am - Finally fell to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
730am - woke up and could not get back to sleep. Mind still felt very active, but the majority of the effects of the trip were gone.<BR>
<BR>
Reflection: I enjoyed the experience. I did not stray far from my notebook the whole trip, and had an enlightening time exploring my writing and thoughts on recent events in my life. I realized more than ever that I'm a fairly morbid person at heart, and that I'm very comfortable with that.<BR>
<BR>
     Thoughts of having people around to talk to on the same level as me were appealing. When I try this again, I want to do it with a friend or two that take a similar dosage.<BR>
<BR>
     I also began thinking on being still, as I mentioned earlier. This is concentrating on being as still as I can be in order to more carefully appreciate everything going on around me from moment to moment, by noticing the states of inactivity between moments at a very exact level. I've carried this with me since the trip, and feel pleased with the event.<BR>
<BR>
Caution:<BR>
This is a very potent hallucinogen. I have had experience with LSD, mescaline, 5MEO-DIPT, DXM, and mushrooms, some at high doses, and this is comparable in strength to any of them.<BR>
<BR>
Care must be taken. The threshold at which the trip becomes obviously perception altering seems to be very sharp. A friend of mine did 10mg and had a trip that was nowhere near in intensity to what I described above. Doses under 6mg seem to have very little effect, although different reports say otherwise.<BR>
<BR>
In all, it was pleasant, though a little long, and I plan to do it again, albeit at a slightly lower dosage.<!--   End Body   -->

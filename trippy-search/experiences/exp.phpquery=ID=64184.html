Ok so, I'm your average teenager, 16 years old, with no current mental, or physical problems that I know of. I also do recreational drugs once in a while like weed, alchohal, and shrooms, but last night I decided that I would try some Ritalin. I went into the trip expecting a whole lot and I had an open mind and a great mood.<br>
<br>
My trip began at around 9:20PM last night when my parrents went to sleep. I decided to start off slowly and took only one of my 30mg. capsuls. At 9:50PM I took annother 30mg cap since the first one didn't seem to be doing anything at all. When it was about 10:30PM I started to feel something but I couldn't tell exactly what it was so I just sat watching TV for annother 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
Ok now heres where I do something stupid. Somewhere between 10:45PM and 11:45PM I had taken two more 30mg. capsuls (Very very bad idea, remember to always start out on the lowest dose possible). I was now on 120mg.'s of methylphenidate and I had no idea what I was getting myself into.<br>
<br>
At around 12:00AM exactly, I was starting to buzz, and feel slightly euphoric. I thought that this was going to be the peak of my experiment, so I went online and talked with some friends. I felt like I had so much to say, but not enough time to say it in and I was so damn happy.<br>
  <br>
At about 1:15AM my high mysteriously vanished. Now this really confused me because I had heard that the methylphenidate would have at least kept he high for about 4 hours at least. So I was kinda pissed at the fact that I had only gotten a real rush going for about 2 hours and now it was gone (thats what I had thought at the time at least).<br>
<br>
So I went to my living room and watched TV until 2:00AM, and then walked to my bedroom. I remember having a very strange sickly feeling in my stomach, not like I was going to throw up but like something was happening inside me. So almost as soon as I had lay down I noticed that my hands and feet were fucking freezing. I was slightly shaking and my eyes were wide open. I realized that my trip had not nearly been over and that it was just beginning.<br>
<br>
So I just sat there staring at things and thinking extremely deep and odd thoughts, when the high really started kicking in. By  that time it was only 2:15AM and I slowly realized that I had taken WAY more than my mind or body could handle. I tryed to think of something to do but my thoughts were racing so fast, it was like I just couldn't stop thinking. I finaly thought of listening to some music, so i put on some pink floyd and was actualy able to enjoy about 1-2 songs before I felt like my high was way too out of control to enjoy anything.<br>
<br>
(Now before I go any further I would like to say that all drugs seem to affect me far more than they do to other people). So anyway I sat there staring at my walls and random shit around my room until about 3:15AM when I decided I'd had enough. I turned off my music and tryed to relax. My heart rate was WAY above normal somewhere around 150 (I was too high to even count that fast).<br>
  <br>
I started to really freak out after I began hallucinating. The walls of my room were now shifting around kind of like jello and bowing in and out. I remember the door to my room was slowly shrinking and growing, but it was very subtle. Everything in my room looked like it had barely visible light trails all over them (kinda like when on mushrooms). But seriously I was scarred shitless I didn't know what was going to happen I thought I was going to over dose and die, honestly. I was not expecting the trip to get that intense at all, it was like two times as crazy as any mushroom trip I have ever been on.<br>
<br>
So I ended up sitting there in my room, with my eyes darting all over the place looking at everything as it slightly moved around.  My body was pulsing with blood, but way more than I had ever felt it go before. The high seemed to be getting more intense with every pound of my racing heart. My chest began to ache from the pain of my thumping heart, and my whole body was in a cold sweat as I prepared to die.<br>
<br>
Well the high continued its course ravaging my body, starting and stopping as it pleased when finally it seemed to stop for good. It was around 4:30AM in the morning and my body felt, to say the least, like a pile of shit. I got out of bed, and went to use the bathroom. My body felt far worse than after any hang over I have ever had. My chest still hurt like hell and my heart was still messed up, it would race for about 5 minutes, then go back to normal, then race 10 minutes later, then go back. When I got up and started talking to my parrents they didnt seem to notice anything, but I felt very depressed and felt very achy in my whole body (especialy my head). I couldnt laugh at anything, and couldn't eat a bite.<br>
<br>
So now it's about 8:36 AM in the morning, my arms and legs are still freezing, my heart is finaly starting to act relatively regular, and things in my peripheral vision still tend to move and shift around at random. I'm still fairly depressed, and mentaly raw. If I had to change one thing about this trip, I would probably have just stopped at 60mg. and probably had an awsome night. But now I have to go pay the consequences, and get my heart checked out because it seriously feels fucked up...<br>
<br>
REMEMBER: DON'T RUSH YOUR TRIPS, TAKE IT SLOWLY WHEN TRYING SOMETHING FOR THE FIRST TIME NO MATTER WHAT! Happy Trippin<!--   End Body   -->

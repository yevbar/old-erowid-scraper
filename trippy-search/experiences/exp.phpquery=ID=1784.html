I started out the day with three cups of coffee. Good-size cups; at least 100mg of caffeine each. In preparation for the afternoon show at which my band was playing, I'd set a cold-water extraction a-brewing the day before (1lb ground coffee --- espresso grind, in this case --- mixed with 9cups cold water, brewed at room temperature for 24hrs) and began to strain it. I tasted it and determined it was going to knock me on my ass, and set out to pack up my drum kit.<BR>
<BR>
In the 45min before our set, I had the full nine cups of the brew (about 15 coffee cups' worth), and what I'm guessing to be about 2.5g of caffeine poured into my system. I set up with unbelievable fervor, and was literally screaming at anyone and everyone to go, go, go! We started and played our 25 minute set in 15 minutes. I tore through the songs like they were toys; our set ended entirely too soon and I was ready for more. I calculatedly started to break down my drum kit and soon noticed that I was breathing very, very heavily and the room was getting very, very sparkly and grey. I finished and then went to lie down on the club's couch for a while. It was then (T+45min) that things went far downhill. My limbs tingled and I was seeing spots. The room was truly spinning, and the band playing 10' from my head seemed miles away. An hour later and I could just then start standing; one more half-hour and I decided I was ok to drive home. I felt dull for the entire ride home, including a stop at Burger King with the other band, who were from Eastern Europe and were fucking weirdos and would have normally interested me. I felt crappy and wasted the rest of the day, and couldn't get to sleep until T+16h...<BR>

Caffeine is awesome. Caffeine poisoning sucks shit. Don't do it.<!--   End Body   -->

I had gone over to a friends house for some hang out time and video games. They pulled out a couple bowls and began smoking this stuff (Spice). I had only ever smoked weed before, having preferred other kinds of recreationals in the past, but I didn't see any harm in trying it. I was a bit bored anyway. I was on no other medications other than a small dosage of birth control.<br>
<br>
I took three hits (about 30 seconds apart) and within five minutes, I began to feel as if I were buzzed on alcohol. The tip of my tongue and roof of my mouth went half-numb, as well as my toes and fingertips. I began to feel warm and fuzzy all over. I thought, 'This isn't so bad. I can handle this.' Unfortunately, I don't remember much after that point.<br>
<br>
My buddies popped in a comedy cartoon. I found myself curled up in the corner of the couch staring at it, unblinking. They were giggling like crazy while I simply couldn't follow the words enough to know what was going on. I could focus on each individual word as it was spoken and string perhaps two or three together, but by the time the third of fourth word came around, I had forgotten the context. Every once in a while, something unbelievable funny would happen on the television and I would find myself smiling and giggling, as if my body found the cartoon to be funny but I hadn't consciously smiled. By this point, I was feeling extremely dizzy and was unable to focus my attention easily. I could focus on only one thing at a time, like the remote control or the television, but everything 'outside' of the item I focused on was in a kaleidoscope. My body felt completely numb only when I did not move it. When I touched my fingertips together or wiggled my toes, all my attention (regardless of where else it had been) was instantly focused on the moving parts of my body. Emotionally, I felt almost dead and apathetic. Any colorful thoughts that crossed my mind were only focused on how strange I felt, casually wondering when it would pass.<br>
<br>
About half an hour after my first hit, I went to go lay down. One friend went with me. Walking was easier than I thought it would be through my drunken haze. I was completely conscious of what was going on around me ONLY WHEN I MOVED MY BODY, but my body did not want to obey and could not find balance. I found myself stumbling and having to be half-carried to the bedroom. I laid down and closed my eyes. I was tired, but not enough to fall asleep. The constant dizziness was making me feel nauseous.<br>
<br>
Then, my throat began to hurt. It did not hurt in a sore way, as if I were ill, but in a painful, agonizing way. It felt as if someone had put a ring in my windpipe and was trying to expand the ring, forcing my windpipe to open farther than was physically possible. Within two minutes of the initial pain in my throat, my body began to move of its own accord again. My chest heaved and my mouth opened wide. My head rolled back and I felt rigid all over, as if my body were made of stone. I was swiftly losing feeling in my neck. I could not speak, close my mouth, or move my neck. Breathing was very difficult. I was barely conscious of my friend beside me, shaking me and telling me to focus on him. My hands went to my throat on their own and gripped, as if I was choking. Inside, I was unable to control myself or stop what was going on around me. I seriously began to worry if I was going to die. Was I having a heart attack? Was my airway closing up (though it most certainly felt like it was expanding)? Should the emergency services be called?<br>
<br>
As quickly as it began, it ended about ten minutes later and my 'high' quickly began dissipate. I could feel a bit more of my body and could focus on more than one object at a time. I had cotton mouth like nobody's business. I drank a full bottle of water, then laid back. The panic was gone and all my senses were slowly beginning to sharpen. I tried to talk to my friend about what had happened, but found I couldn't speak full sentences because my mind would simply stop thinking from time to time. He asked if I was hungry and I said no, the thought of food sickened me. After laying there for about an hour, I was able to chain my thoughts together and speak full sentences. I promptly fell asleep and awoke about an hour later. My friend was fast asleep beside me and would not wake. In perfect control of my body again, I left and drove myself home without any trouble. Upon arriving home, I ate and fell asleep.<br>
<br>
Now that I've awoken, I still feel the effects. My mind is having a hard time keeping track of the sentences I write, and sometimes I'll replace words like 'when' with another like 'where' or 'who,' which is highly unusual for me. I am hungry and, in all honesty, the stove has been on the entire time I've spent writing this. I cannot seem to focus on writing this experience AND keep in mind that the stove is on--I keep forgetting.<br>
<br>
That being said, I would not try Spice again. I have not sought a medical opinion as to what happened to me last night, but I'm very curious and plan on consulting my doctor very soon, since this stuff is legal. This is Nostalgia, signing off.<!--   End Body   -->

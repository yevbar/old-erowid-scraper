My first time with mushrooms and definitely not the last. I've had experience with weed and sally d.<br>
<br>
I ate the candy about 5 o’clock – with 20 minutes left in class. I was expecting a come on time of around 45 minutes, so I should start feeling the effects a little after my 15 minute walk home. Class continued to drag on, the subject was interesting, but my attention was on the purple foil and wax paper that had wrapped the chocolate I just consumed. It tasted somewhat funny – like old, cheap chocolate. I wondered about the path it took to get to me. Rumor has it they came from California – that’s a long way for chocolate mushrooms to travel in the United States. After that, they probably were passed through a few dealers down to the guy my friend bought it from. A man I’ve never met, but a man that helped open my eyes nonetheless.<br>
<br>
My walk home seemed quick, it was a beautiful day and I was looking forward to the experience ahead of me. Would I see melting shoes, breathing walls, visit alien worlds, and smell colors? I was nervous with excitement. Arriving home to my small apartment, I turned on the Simpson’s, as I always did after class, and sat down to await my first effects. I felt restless, like something should be happening. I was growing hungry. I decided I should probably eat now, so I wouldn’t have to disrupt my experience later in the night. I made some rice with broccoli, and ate a small plate.<br>
<br>
I went back for seconds, but didn’t make it. I was consumed with laughter. My own, pure, unadulterated laughter. I wasn’t laughing at anything in particular, just laughing to laugh. The sound of my laugh made me giggle, my giggle made me snort, and my snort made me burst into an uproarious laugh.<br>
<br>
I turned off the Simpon’s because I found it oddly distracting and not funny. Strange I thought, me finding the Simpson’s boring. I lay down on the couch to relax, it had been a stressful weak. Staring at the ceiling I hoped to see some kind of visual effect since the mushrooms were obviously in my system. I was disappointed by the normal ceiling staring back at me. I closed my eyes and felt my body turn into jelly. I was so relaxed. I started to see patterns on my eyelids. They were very faint – red, green, and blue – worm like structures. They were wiggling, snaking, and contorting themselves in front of me. They felt natural; they should be there. It was as if I was looking into the building blocks of life itself. They started to form helixes twisting around each other and blending to into two long red, green, and blue dotted strains, swirling around each other.<br>
<br>
I opened my eyes and was overwhelmed by the desire for some chocolate. Another very strange feeling for me. I never crave chocolate. I searched around my apartment for a minute, realizing I had none, I pondering going outside. The sun was starting to set. It was the hour when everything is orange and red outside. I figured it would be a good idea to venture out and see the world. <br>
<br>
I threw on a hoodie and set out on my trip to the gas station to purchase some Hostess Cupcakes, which I was now craving like nothing I ever had before. It was beautiful out; everything had that sun-orange glow to it. The closer I got to the station, the stranger I started to feel. It seemed I shouldn’t be wearing shoes, shouldn’t be living in the concrete world, and shouldn’t be going to a corporate environment. I arrived at the station and went inside. A black man was working, stacking beer, he was singing and dancing with the radio and looked completely happy. The fact that he was so happy, so joyous, even though he was working made me smile with all my soul. I found the cupcakes I had been craving, purchased them from the man and was on my way.<br>
<br>
I felt as though I was carrying so much more than cupcakes. I wanted to rip them open and devour them on the spot. I decided I should wait because it would make them so much better. I wanted to sit out on the patio and eat them under the setting sun. About half way home I couldn’t resist any longer. I opened the package and in two huge bites ate the first one. I waited to eat the second one. <br>
<br>
Arriving back at my apartment, I went to the patio and sat on the brick wall. I ate my cupcake, felt the sun warming every cell on my face, and stared down at the Aztec patterns in the stones of patio. I wanted to be an Aztec, without a doubt they knew the power of these mushrooms and so much more. An ancient civilization that knew so much more than we know now.<br>
<br>
I went back into my apartment and turned out the lights. The only light was a low red glow coming from the window. I decided to eat some more rice so I filled my plate back up and put it in the microwave. While waiting for it to heat, I realized I was seeing trails on my hands. The microwave was done, so I sat down and started to eat the rice. It was so full of flavor, so delicious and nutritious tasting. I couldn’t understand why I was using a fork to eat it – man had lived for thousands of years with nothing but his hands to eat food. I put down the fork and started to use my fingers. This made the food taste even better. I stopped about half way through the plate because I was feeling full. While looking down at the plate half full of food, it started to breathe. It had come alive and was breathing. It felt as if my entire apartment was alive and full of life. It felt good to be there, a warm feeling.<br>
<br>
I put some music on, Buddha Bar III, and laid back down on the couch and closed my eyes. Again I saw the spirals, but this time there were more. I was seeing a pair of beautiful female eyes with them. At first just a flash here and there, but then they became steady, intertwining with the spirals. I came to realize after a few minute of studying them that they were not just any eyes. They were they single most important eyes I had ever seen, they were the eyes of the Goddess of Creation. She was watching me, she was always watching me, and still is. She watches all of us, for we are all her creation and dearly beloved by her. She has a complete and utter care for each and every one of us and our well-being.<br>
<br>
I began to feel her presence with me after a few minutes. She was standing over me, studying me. She felt all my sicknesses, my pains, my stress, and my happiness. She understood them more than I did. She began to wave her hands over me and I felt a warmth coming down from them. She was healing me with Qi-Gong energy work. She brushed off my body, removing all the bad energy and then focused on my abdomen. She was burning something out of me, something bad. I felt a strong heat over my right-top side. Then she moved on. I had been cured, of what I didn’t know, but I felt better and cleaner. My head was cleared.<br>
<br>
After I received the energy work from the Goddess of Creation, I felt very liberated. I started thinking about my surroundings and my environment, and my thoughts drifted to the ground beneath my feet. The earth! It was there for me! It always had been and always will be. We make our living off the earth, everything comes from the earth, and eventually everything goes back to the earth. Everything, from plastic sporks to rocking chairs to jetliners come from the earth. Without her, we have nothing. I started communicating with the earth on a spiritual level. I could hear her pains, joys, and sorrows – We are killing our mother earth – from which we are all born. I could see and feel the earth in front of me and I reached my arms out and embraced her. Mother earth began to sob on my shoulder, I could feel the tears, nearly breaking down into tears myself.<br>
<br>
They were the tears of a forgotten mother, a mother who had lost touch with her children. The earth gives birth to all of us, yet we ignore her, disregard her, and destroy her. We offer no thanks, no gratitude, nothing for the one that gives us EVERYTHING we have.<br>
<br>
I started focusing on the back of my eyelids again. I still had my arms up from hugging the earth. I could see my arms through my eyelids. I moved them, and the image of them moved too, right in sync. This was astounding to me.<br>
<br>
I got up to use the bathroom. As I stood in nearly complete darkness, I closed my eyes while I peed. I was transported to another time, an ancient time, and another place. I stood in the darkness of the night with only the light of the moon over a damp green pasture. I was naked and free. The air was clean and fresh. My mind was unpolluted with the worries of modern times – no information overload.<br>
<br>
I finished and zipped up. I went and sat on the couch to ponder my experience in the bathroom. When I sat down, my position flashed me back to early China. I was a very old, very respected man. My children looked up to me and my wife was deceased. I missed her and loved her very much. I could feel my old wrinkled face and leathery hands. The room was dimly lit by a small fire and I knew that I was not long for this world. I could feel my time drawing near and as I looked back on my live, I felt full of pride and happiness. I had hard time, many of them, by between those times I was happy with a healthy loving family.<br>
<br>
I laid back down on my couch and watched my hands moving through my eyelids again. I became restless on the couch and wanted to be closer to the earth. I moved from the couch to the floor of my apartment. I was lying right next to the speaker and all I could hear were the luscious tones of Buddha Bar. I closed my eyes and drifted into another time.<br>
<br>
I was curled up next to my wife on a deerskin; we were shivering. I looked around; we were in a teepee gently lit by a small fire. I was cold and I could smell the snow on the ground. I got up, stretched, and went outside. The air was so crisp and stinging in my lungs. I took a big breath and held it in. I felt worrisome about the white men from Europe. We had been battling with them for the last few months and defeat was evitable. We had already been pushed back from the coast. The way they live was just not right. They had no respect for the land that feeds them. I went back in and lay back down with my wife.<br>
<br>
As I drifted back to the now, the music began to reverberate in my ears. I could feel the pulsing beat in my chest. I stood up and started moving to the music. My moves turned into dances and the dances took over my head. I danced like a fool, for a good thirty minutes with no one watching by the Goddess of Creation.<!--   End Body   -->

I have one pill that was given to me as Ecstasy/MDMA. I had split the pill in half, and swallowed one half with some tap water.<br>
<br>
An hour passed and I felt nothing, so I swallowed the other half with some tap water.<br>
<br>
A Half hour passes and I still feel nothing. So I undress and lay down in bed and try to go to sleep assuming the pill was bunk.<br>
<br>
As I lay in bed I can feel tingling sensation crawling down my back from my shoulders, then a while later I moved my head and it felt incredibly light as if the force of gravity had been reduced. I then noticed the same sensation in my arm and decidied to get out of bed as I may now be feeling the sensation of the drug.<br>
<br>
I sat in front of the computer and put on some music with headphones as it was late at night. I didn't notice any auditory distortions, but I felt differently about the music, possibly more emotionally connected.<br>
<br>
My limbs feel so easy to move like they had been oiled. I wanted to dance to music but I was so physically relaxed that I found it difficult to hold my body upright.<br>
<br>
As the experience intensified I became more physically relaxed to the extent that while sitting in the computer chair I coudln't hold my head upright either, all my limbs were floppy. I ended up laying on the floor with a pillow as I couldn't support my body.<br>
<br>
Over all I notice a time dilation through the experience. <br>
<br>
At about 3 hours into the experience I went back to bed and went to sleep quicker than I usually do when sober.<br>
<br>
I woke up about 7 hours later after a some of the best sleep I've had in a long time. For the next 2 days I feel totally relaxed as I did during the experience but all other effects of the drug are absent. This relaxation makes it difficult to to concentrate and focus on work.<!--   End Body   -->

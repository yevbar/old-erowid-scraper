Its right after school around 3 o’clock and my friend texts me. Wanna trip? I call him and say yeah I have money and head over to his house. I cough up 20 bucks and he gives me a little clear capsule. I was immediatlly pissed off because it felt and looked empty. he promised it wasn’t and split it apart on a cd case. There it was, a fine white powder about 1/4 the size of an eraser on a pencil. <br>
<br>
So I got a dollar bill and snorted it. The first and only thing I notice it the burn. My nose burns so hard I tear for 10 minutes and my throat burns terribly for another 20. WTF did I snort? battery acid? so I was starting to get mad and I stand up to go push him against the wall. lo and behold, I cant stand up. I lay back, still tearing, to notice the ceiling swirling like food coloring in water. I feel a certain haze come over my body. <br>
<br>
Everything is so interesting. Smooth has never been this smooth before, red has never been this red before. There is motion blur and trails when I look around. The sun outside looked beautiful. The bed I lay in was so damn comfortable. it was like I was on a differnt planet. My thoughts were noticablly high too, I couldn’t make a straight sentence, but my actuall ideas were genious and inciteful. <br>
<br>
Certain sounds I didn’t hear at all, while the softest ones were the most prevalent. I could tell my friends amps were on in the garadge when I was upstairs. And that was me hearing the barely auidable static. When I had to leave and I was in public, it looked as if everybody knew I was high. But that’s just paranoia I guess. <br>
<br>
It’s 8 o’clock and I’m eating alone wondering when I would stop tripping balls. I go upstairs to my room alone. I draw pictures for hours. I usually don’t draw that much, but last time I did shrooms I couldn’t remember all my deep thoughts so I felt like recording them. I stopped tripping hard at around 4 am. So I had a complete 12 hour trip. Why smoke weed? this shit is un regulated, doens’t show up on tests, fucks you up 3 times longer, doesn’t make you tired, and doesn’t smell for hours later when you do it.<!--   End Body   -->

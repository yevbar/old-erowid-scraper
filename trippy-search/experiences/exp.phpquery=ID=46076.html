This report is more for people who are being prescribed or thinking about accepting their all-knowing shrink's offer to perscribe them Seroquel, not recreational users... If I ever caught someone using seroquel recreationally I would have to smack them upside the head and laugh in their face as a matter of principle.<BR>
<BR>
Well, to start off with what I think of this drug:  it fucks me up in a baaaad way.  A couple years ago I was seeing a shrink who perscribed wellbutrin for my depression and more importantly my anxiety,  but when I told him I was having irregulaties in my sleeping, he immediately thought of a brilliant solution... Seroquel.  He thought it would help restore healthy sleeping patterns and help relax me to the point that I could get rid of the constant hopeless thoughts barraging my head.  I was hesitant for about a month (I'm a heavy skeptic) to try satans drug of choice,  but after looking up every bit of info there was on long-term, low dose experiences, I decided what the hell, he probably knows what he's doing.  At this point in my life  I had taken a semester off school due to a rather severe depression, and was soon to be returning for the next.<BR>
<BR>
Anyways, on to the experience.  I was told to take them half an hour before I would be sleeping,  so I took half a pill (12.5)  and waited.  20 minutes later, BOOM  I'm a dysfunctional retard.  I head to bed feeling heavy, with no thoughts in my head, and I fall asleep instantly.  Success!  I guess....<BR>
<BR>
Waking up I found myself completely clouded over and my personality had seemingly dissapeared.  I stuck to my regimen for a coupla weeks, and noticed that if I let it kick in around dinner, I would not be able to understand anything of what was going on around me. Voices were just sounds, I would stare into space non-stop, and couldn't funcion in the least when it came to washing dishes, for example.  If this sounds somehow fun, it was not.  It was actually terrifying to think that I was putting a chemical in me that was turning me into this.<BR>
<BR>
School started up again and weird things started happening. I upped my dosage to 50 mgs every night. At shool I would just wander around the hallways, not talk to anyone, and just generally act weird.  People kept on telling me that I had changed during my sabbatical.  I became uninterested in talking and people began calling me monosyllabic Jake.  to which I had no argument other than 'uhuh.' One told me I could have my soul back; he had eaten the piece of paper on which I declared my soul in exchange for lunch money.   One even sat me down and explained;  'You seem different.  what the fuck happened to you?  You're just like a zombie now.' - that about sums it up.<BR>
<BR>
Something fucking weird happened awhile later, though.  Me n some friends went camping up in some cabins in the local mountains, bringing enough pot for a bob marley concert.  All was good, we had fun, smoked pot, frolicked in the snow n all that, and went to sleep.... without me taking my pill.   The next morning we smoked some hash for breakfast and began heading down the mountain.  I smoked too much and knew it.   After my last hit I heard this sizzling-frying noise in my brain and then a *POP* sound. That was when shit went all pear-shaped for me.  I began to think that my friends were planning on cutting me to pieces and burying me under the ice of a nearby lake.  I was truly psychotic, in another world.  It was as though there was another mind in me forcing its evil, horrible, paranoid thoughs on mine and there was nothing I could do to stop it.  I tried real hard to get my shit together again, but nothing worked; the other 'mind' was just raping my reality.  At one point my friends were standing right in front of me trying to snap me out of it,  but I couldn't understand what they were saying so I just stared at them with a pained expression on my face.  It was, by all means, the single WORST experience of my life.  If I ever had to live in that stare again, even for a week maybe, I would much rather die.  And I mean that.  It took me three days to recover from it.  <BR>
<BR>
I'm glad I took it as a sign that these drugs weren't doing me much good so I tapered off my dosage and stopped taking them.... and so far, I'm doing much better that I was on them. My personality is back, and I can have good conversations again.<BR>
<BR>
As a result of all this,  I have lost all faith in psychiatry and their drugs, and I've come to the conclusion that doctors don't REALLY know what their doing with those potent chemicals.<BR>
<BR>
It may be helpful in high doses to sedate those severe paranoid schizophrenics, but its effects are basically like a chemical lobotomy.  Frightening.<!--   End Body   -->

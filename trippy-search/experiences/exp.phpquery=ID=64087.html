<br>
Mimosa + Rue = DMT buzz. Mimosa + Rue + Atropine = Power.<br>
<br>
I am a 20 year old male, work a lot, babysit a lot, and when I have time I LOVE to trip. I cannot even imagine how I might go about describing this miserable experience. Now I usually keep belladonna and dmt separate. I remember reading online somewhere along the way that certain shamans would toss about 2 or 3 datura leaves into their ayahausca to potentiate the alkaloids harmine and harmala. Given that their brew was meant to dose about 30, I semi-converted the dosage of datura stramonium to that of atropa belladonna and made my brew.<br>
<br>
I've always started my doses low and worked up, however, this time I made an exception. I decided to just chug my normal amount and go on with it. I had no idea how strong the belladonna would make the brew. As soon as I drank the shit my stomach turned.<br>
<br>
I have used datura and belladonna on multiple occasions. The very first time was with datura. It was bad. really bad. Standing in a field, at work, tripping like a bitch. I could not tell what the hell was going on yet alone even remember who I am. After that experience I decided to start low with each batch of any plant I get and work my way up. Doing that I had many wonderful experiences. Sure there was some 'What the hell's going on' but it was all good.<br>
<br>
I have had mimosa about 15 times now. Sometimes I puke, and it's a fluke. Other times, It's the most wonderful hour I have ever had. Immense Hallucinations and rushes of warmth thru my body. When I would close my eyes the hallucinations would fractalize. If I stayed still for a bit longer, all feeling would cease. I would be totally transferred to a different place and time, so it seemed. <br>
<br>
<br>
Here was the full setup I had going on.<br>
<br>
Everything was weighed on a scale.<br>
Fluids were measured in measuring cups.<br>
<br>
MAOI: Syrian rue. 22.5 grams slowly simmered (ever slightly) over 4 hours for five doses total. Water amount unknown. Slowly cooked it down to exactly five cups. 1 cup per dose.<br>
<br>
Mimosa, 70 grams. Belladonna, 2 pinches. Should have been 1/2. Syrian rue 8g (to spike it up a notch). Cooked as above. Slowly cooked down to 15 cups. 3 cups per dose.<br>
<br>
T+0:00 -> Drank 1 cup syrian rue brew. Wasn't the best thing I've tasted but, I got it down easily.<br>
<br>
T+0:30 -> Feeling funny, rue kicking in.<br>
<br>
T+0:45 -> Drank 3 cups of my ayahausca brew. Seemed like the rue numbed my taste buds, so it wasn't too bad.<br>
<br>
T+1:00 -> Feeling whacked dude. Good but, sick. So I proceeded to do the normal purging. I knew something was off as soon as I did. I couldn't stop dry heaving and felt an evil feeling about. The belladonna decided to bite me this time.<br>
<br>
T+1:02 -> I didn't think the belladonna would make this so strong. As soon as I go to brush my teeth I'm feeling awful. I finish brushing and things start to roll in my head. I felt a ball about 1mx1m around my head. In it was hallucinations of many sorts, all rolling around each other pulling my mind into an endless loop. In the ball, I saw myself getting really sick and being air lifted away. I had this utter sensation of deja-vu. Now I get deja-vu alot.<br>
<br>
That deja-vu coupled with the hallucination I had and the indescribable evilness I felt swirling around me did me in. I was going insane in my head tripping of all sorts of bad things. I don't get it. I've never had anything so evil before but I guess it happens. I go into my room, carrying the ball with me on my head. Things get worse. All I can think is 'call an ambulance'.<br>
<br>
T+1:30 -> I can't fight it this time. I go downstairs to wake my sister up from a nap and tell her what's happening. (BTW, it's me and my sis with her kids in this house.) I'm freezing cold. I got a blanket it wrapped it around myself. I remember saying her name loudly a couple times. She popped up 'What?' I'm like dude I'm having a real bad trip. She asks me what's wrong. I try explaining to her I'm really sick and tripping so hard I thought I was dead.<br>
<br>
Of course, the belladonna took back over. I couldn't spit out a full phrase to her for the life of me. She eventually asked if I needed. To go to the hospital. <br>
I said yes, even though I meant no! After what seemed like forever I think I finally told her I really didn't wanna go. I sat there rocking back and forth just tripping so many evil things. The whole time I'm trying to speak the room was split in half vertically and slanted like /\. Everything was swirling (the ball) and on top of that I had extremely strong auditory hallucinations which I've never had before. Everything sounded like I was in a tunnel. When I would try to talk I'd hear my speech echo around this tunnel which made it really hard to finish a sentence. <br>
The balladonna makes it so I'm thinking I've said something or are saying something but really, it's in my mind.<br>
<br>
Somewhere along the line I told her I needed some coffee. Caffeine always pushed out tropane alkaloids for me. After she started brewing some I told her I needed some now. So she went to the coffee pot and poured me half a coupled of really strong coffee. As soon as she went to hand it to me I mumbled 'shit maois, fucking seriously' She brought me it anyway even though I couldn't drink it. So I asked her for some water. I think I drank 6 cups of water over the next three hours.<br>
<br>
T+?:?? -> Now it's bad. I'm trying to relax to let my heart chill cuz it was beating at like 4 beats a second. When I sit back my eyes close. I had to fight with the entire mind I had left to keep them open. When they'd close I'd feel the ball swirling up again. Many more bad hallucinations and such swirling energy. All of my feeling is gone. I would think I had something crawling on my foot or arm but of course they was trips. I'm so far gone right now. <br>
<br>
I'd keep trying to open my eyes but everything was swirling so much in my vision it was making me sick again. So I'd close them and trip harder. This spiking in and out of reality continued on. Here and there I would try telling little bits about balladonna, maois, and such to my sister. What I can eat, drink, do. What to look for. And I kept repeating 'do not let me sleep'. I told her every time my eyes <br>
close everything gets so bad. I told her that as I fall into the ball and relax to much my breathing dies down. I kept noticing I'd forget to breath when that happened which freaked me out. I've had it happen before though. <br>
<br>
Over the next couple hours I'd try and talk a little here and there. Most of the time it was in my head. I'd keep plummeting into the grasp of the ball and eventually spiking out for maybe 10-120 seconds. When I would come to I would remind my sister not to let me fall in. I just kept fighting to keep my eyes open and keep breathing. There was one time that I kinda fell in and quit breathing. Luckily my sister woke me to reality.<br>
<br>
Each time I'd spike up, I'd feel a little better. She was starting to freak a lil so I told her the maois would drop out about 3 hours in. After that the belladonna should start to dissipate.<br>
<br>
T+4:00 - > Finally a break. I felt my stomach turning. Gas. And I had to urinate badly. Finally the ayahausca had released me. I proceed to do my business and start feeling better right afterwards. I don't know why but as soon as I peed the plummets into the ball stopped. The ball simply ceased. I was still tripping, tracers and mind loops. There was still an extremely evil feeling around everything. Even with that going on I was enjoying myself.<br>
<br>
T+4:30 -> 3 hours later I was able to talk almost normally. I told my sister exactly what happened and what I did wrong. I told her how sorry I was to put her thru that and that I was ok now. I go outside for a cig. After I come inside I start typing up this report. Now I've been typing this for about 2 hours off and on. Relaxing here and there enjoying reality. <br>
<br>
I must say, tropanes + harmala/harmine/.. + DMT = fucking WOW.<br>
<br>
I could have taken probably a quarter of what I did and had a very pleasant ayahausca experience. This report cannot even do justice the misery and pure evil I felt the whole time. The whole time I thought I was dead. There was a crazy time perception going on too. Everything was slow. really slow. those few hours seemed like a day. <br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure I'll be fine mentally after this considering all that happened. I'm happy just to be back. Everything still has an odd feeling but, I'm sure that will last into tomorrow.<!--   End Body   -->

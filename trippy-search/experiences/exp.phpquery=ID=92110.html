<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: 100 mgs of 5-MeO-DALT is considered an extremely high dose, see 5-MeO-DALT Dose Chart]</FONT> <br>
<br>
A group of four (my two best friends, my boyfriend, and I), who have had many drug experiences together, met at my boyfriend's place last night to ostensibly take some good rolls.  One individual brought along 5-MeO-DALT, which none of us had experienced before.  It was late, and we decided that, from brief research (mistake #1), the 5-MeO-DALT would be a much shorter, milder experience.  <br>
<br>
The few reports we perused seemed to suggest doses in the 10-30mg range were insignificant. I looked at some other websites and forums (not for more than 10 minutes) and found a couple of good experiences around the 90-100mg range, which likened the hallucinations to a healthy dose of P. Cubensis. So that's what we took.<br>
<br>
Individual #1 (me) – 6' tall, 160 lb, semi-regular cannabis smoker, experienced primarily with MDMA, many benzos, mushrooms, methamphetamine, cocaine, and other one-time experiences (no LSD, however). Had not eaten in @10 hrs.<br>
<br>
Individual #2 (my bf) – 5'9 tall, 160 lb, and the rest is similar. Had not eaten in @10 hrs.<br>
<br>
Individual #3 – 5'5 tall, @150 lb, least experienced in the group, but pretty much the same as above  with less frequency. Had a huge meal 2-3 hrs prior.<br>
<br>
Individual #4 – 6'5 tall, weight unknown but estimated @300 lb.  Drugs are same as above, but with more experience than any of us.  Ate @4-5 hrs before, unsure of quantity, but has a very slow metabolism and usually has a long latency period with many drugs.<br>
<br>
Experience:<br>
<br>
T+00:00 - We ingested 100mg each at 1:20 am by licking the white powder off a table and chasing it with water.<br>
<br>
T+00:05 – I had barely eaten in 10 hrs, so the onset came rapidly.  Tingling sensations, malaise, slight confusion and ataxia. <br>
<br>
T+00:10 – The above effects grew stronger, I felt like I was shaking and anything I looked at began shaking wildly. I was very thirsty and breathing became irregular. My bf began to have a bad trip. I tried to reassure him to no avail. We found a temazapem (dosage unknown), but he refused to take it, stating that he had already taken .5mg of clonazepam (his last). <br>
<br>
T+00:15 – Things really started to go wrong. I was in the kitchen trying to drink and felt faint. I managed to put my glass down on the counter, but barely. I kept trying to help my bf but nothing could reach him. I began to feel disembodiment, intense visuals (melting faces with eyes open, unbelievable kaleidoscopes with eyes closed).  Somehow, I managed to suppress it for a time while caring for my bf.<br>
<br>
T+00:20 – My bf seems to have begun to exit the bad trip, perhaps with the aid of the clonazepam. Which meant that I began to lose it. I fell to the kitchen floor, total disembodiment began (not in the cool, “my body is melting into the floor” kind of way you experience with shrooms, but more like, “omg I'm merging with the underground and there's nothing I can do to stop it and I will promptly suffocate”). Individual #3 (the big meal eater) barely felt anything at this point, so he tried to help me. I began to bite and claw at him, trying to anchor myself to something corporeal. I couldn't decide if I was better served seeing his figure mutate with my eyes open, or losing myself to the dark visuals with my eyes closed.  <br>
<br>
T+00:25 through 01:00 – For over half an hour, the above continued. At some points I was able to stand, and began to jump up and down crying, screaming out suicidal ideation. I was in the kitchen, but could only think of using a gun. Had knives entered my thoughts, I'm not sure that I would still be alive. I stumbled from room to room, looking for some kind of refuge. I wrapped myself into bed sheets and buried myself into couches. I wanted to die. When I began to forget anything that had happened before taking this substance, it worsened. I had flashes of the prior evening, but they were elusive and I doubted their reality. The past ceased to exist, the future was unimaginable, so I was left with the unbearable pain of the present, which I was convinced would never end. I thought I had perhaps died and gone to hell.  At some point, I remembered the temazepam, found it, and took it, probably close to T+01:00. (Mistake #2 – I NEVER take drugs without having a thermometer and adequate xanax around. We had neither.) All the while, my bf was yelling things along the line of, “Fuck the Industrialized Revolution, fuck the media,” etc etc and a lot of, “you're perfect, I'm perfect, everything is perfect, and we're going to go on forever, and forever, and forever,” ad nauseum.<br>
<br>
T+01:00-01:30 – I don't remember much of what happened in this period. I do remember Individual #4 calling an ambulance but losing reception. Individual #3 was calling a friend for help (I didn't know who he was calling at the time). Apparently, I went into my bf's brother's room, convulsed on the bed for a while, and then fell off the bed (#3 was with me). Here, I ripped off my tanktop (literally into shreds), pissed myself, and tried lifting a barbell with @200 lb of weights on it. The next thing I know, it's T+01:30, I'm emerging from the bathroom (naked – I discarded my soiled pj pants and briefs), right when #3's good friend arrived to help us.It seems the temazepan has taken effect and I leveled off very quickly.<br>
<br>
T+01:45 – My boyfriend continued to preach everyone's perfection, the world's perfection, interlaced with dismissive comments about the media, cosmetic surgery, and similar things. #4 began to feel effects and came to lie down with me in my bf's bed.  #3's friend helped to keep #4 relaxed, and I found some Rx 10mg ambien I've had for months because obviously the lab fucked up and 2 in 3 pills do nothing. We get him to take one.  <br>
<br>
T+02:00-02:40 – I follow #4 from room to room, helping keep him calm. After thirty minutes of the ambien not helping, he agrees to take another. This seems to have an effect within thirty more minutes, and whatever he almost began to experience was held at bay. However, he expressed some dissociation, confusion of where he was, and waves of visuals, mixed with a desire but inability to sleep. During this time, #3's friend is mostly helping my bf. She leaves shortly thereafter.<br>
<br>
T+03:00 - #3 finally began to feel something significant.  I quickly got him to take an ambien. He began to hallucinate his belly and legs becoming distended/enlarged, his hands growing, and his shoulders shrinking. I placed my hand against his and he laughed, being reassured that his hands were still smaller than mine. He kept kicking his legs. <br>
<br>
T+03:30 - #3, who has body dysmorphic issues, began to try to rip the fat off of his body. Somehow, I got him to believe that it was an illusion created by the drug (which it was) and he calmed down a little and I held his hands.  He agreed to take another ambien. My bf has calmed down and, although exhausted, helps keep #3/#4 calm.<br>
<br>
T+04:00 - My bf goes to bed. #3 and #4 are both getting waves of visuals, anxiety, with #3 having some residual leg tremors, but all to a lesser degree than before.  I asked #3 what his favorite anime was, and we put it on. Having something to focus on while the effects were kept under control with the ambien really helped. We watched two episodes, until it was almost T+05:00 (6:20 am) and, knowing that they were okay, I went to bed, making them promise to sleep or rest for a few hours before driving.<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
<br>
I will not be taking this again, in any dose, out of fear that the suicidal ideation and related visuals may be tripped. I will also avoid cannabis (and anything else) for a little while, just in case. I believe the other three are of the same mindset (#3 flushed the remaining powder down the toilet).<br>
<br>
This could have been a pleasant experience (and ended up not being unpleasant for my bf) had we taken far less and built on it in subsequent attempts. But maybe not. I highly discourage a high dosage for a first time use, and I do recommend a sober babysitter. I've had incredibly strong trips before, but I have always managed to tend to others and myself when a crisis occurred. I have been stuck in dark loops with other hallucinogens, but have never had suicidal ideations during them. Here, I had absolutely no control of myself once I was hit with the full force of the 100mg, and I am convinced that had I thought about using a knife, I would have stabbed myself.<!--   End Body   -->

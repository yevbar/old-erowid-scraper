I had tripped on DXM before, but never at an extreme amount as this.<BR>
<BR>
It was the day right after school had gotten out.<BR>
<BR>
The previous day I had gotten up at about 5:00 AM in the morning to go to the store and get some OTC medicine, namely Coricidin Cough + Cold.  I have done it quite a few times before, but usually never exceeding 8-10 pills (240-300 mg).  I began to get very scared of the drug, and decided to quit, but do it one last time.  For about 2 weeks, I was a regular coricidin user before this, but had stopped for about a week before this trip.<BR>
<BR>
It was late, at about 12:30 am. on a Friday night.  I didnt have any weed left, but I remember I had some coricidin.  I really didnt want to, but I went to my room and pulled out the baggie of pills i had popped out of the foil.  I counted them - 24 pills.<BR>
<BR>
'What the heck,' I thought, and I popped 8, then 16, then 24 (with about 5 second intervals in between.)<BR>
  <BR>
I then got back on to my computer, and started to look at some websites.<BR>
About an hour later, I still didnt feel much. (about 1:30 am.)  I remember that when I ate, it hit me faster.  So I pulled out a bag of chips and started munching.<BR>
<BR>
At 2:00, I started to feel kind of drunk.  This was similar to my previous encounters with DXM.  I popped in a movie (South Park), and started to watch.  The characters in the movie were talking very quiet, and I couldnt really keep my eye on one of them.<BR>
<BR>
At about 2:30, I couldnt watch the movie anymore.  It was scaring the hell out of me, and I felt kind of sleepy.  I got up, and fell right down on my face, whacking the coffee table.  I stumbled to my feet, and walked to the bathroom.<BR>
<BR>
It took about 10 or 15 minutes just to pee, and then I looked over at the mirror.  I couldnt see myself, and then for a brief second I came into focus.  I saw a person that I didnt know, and that was a complete stranger to me.  I started to cry when I realized it was me.<BR>
<BR>
The light got to be too much, so I walked to my bedroom.  The walls swirled around me when I left, and the rooms began to separate from eachother.  I walked into my dark room (about 8X8 feet,) and noticed that it was HUGE.<BR>
  <BR>
I made it to my bed, and fell down.  I looked over at the clock, which jumped around and trailed.  I turned away and then back to it, and the numbers jumped out and rushed at me.  I screamed out of terror, but then remembered that it was all fake, a trip, and then smiled.<BR>
<BR>
I then looked up at the fan, which started to make a swirly pattern (it wasnt on.)  I turned to the wall, and it moved in and out at me, and a poster started to fall over towards me.  I turned away and back to the fan, and it started to come at me too.  This was all too much for me, so I jumped out of bed.  I ran out of my room as fast as I could, falling down numerous times, and shut the door hard.  'Everything is after me!'  I thought.<BR>
<BR>
I ran back into the living room and turned on some lights.  I popped the movie back in, and  then forgot it was on and got up.  I ran into my mom in the hallway, and she started to talk gibberish to me.  I said something that I cant even remember, and hugged her, and fell down.  She then walked away.<BR>
<BR>
I went back into the living room, and started to talk to myself.  I looked around, to see that I was dwarfed by the room.  The TV was hundreds of feet high, as were the couches.  I tried to climb back up to one of them, only to fall down.<BR>
<BR>
Once again, I had to go to the bathroom.<BR>
<BR>
When I got there, I went pee (another 15 minute adventure), and then left.  I looked down the hallway to see nothing but an endless hallway with dark windows on either side.  I slunk back in terror, but remembered everything that is scary in my room.  I couldnt take it, so I started to run down the hall, and tripped over the couch that I couldnt see.<BR>
<BR>
I came in and still didnt realize that the movie was on.  All I could see was a blur of light from that direction whenever I looked over there.  I got really scared, almost to the point of crying again.  I looked around, and saw nothing again.  I stayed there, in nothing, for what seemed like hours.<BR>
<BR>
I then got really sleepy and tried to go back to bed.<BR>
<BR>
I made it into bed, but saw that chains and other metal spikey things hanging from my fan (medival toture-like stuff.)  I got really scared, and turned away.  I then like..its hard to explain, but I kinda floated out of my body, to see me there on the bed, scared.  I couldnt take it, I just wanted to get away.  I couldnt focus on the clock when I looked back, and it soon melted away into nothing.<BR>
<BR>
I found myself in nothing again, looking around, with just me there, nothing else.  Everything was black, and I could keep hearing noises like I was in the basement of a power plant or something.<BR>
<BR>
I started to get real scared of dying.  I kept on thinking that this was the end.  I thought that I was dead for a while.  But then i thought, 'Im not going to wake up tomorrow..', and I couldnt stop thinking about it.  I had thoughts it earlier in the trip, but now, I felt like I knew i was about to die.  It was truly one of the scariest moments in my life.<BR>
<BR>
I dont remember much from that point on, and I couldnt see what time it was.<BR>
<BR>
The next day when I got up, I felt odddly refreshed.  I was sweating a whole bunch though.  All I could remember was the big scary things.  I was happy about it though, I actually tripped on Coricidin...<BR>
<BR>
I had to go to work, and everything was still pretty fuzzy.  The lights were VERY bright, and everybody seemed to mumble everythting.  I felt cold, but also kept sweating excessivly.  I also felt very emotional-type, like i could say anything to anybody.  I felt like i could tell a stranger stuff I had locked inside me for years.  It felt great, and I had some good feelings inside too.  My head was also very heavy.<BR>
<BR>
My advice to users:  BE CAREFUL.  I have heard of peopel dying (or getting very sick) with lesser doses than I took (12).<!--   End Body   -->

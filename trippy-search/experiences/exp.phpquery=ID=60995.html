Before I divulge my few experiences with Salvia I'd like to explain a bit about myself. I'm 14, and I'm not just some dumb kid who is recklessly going about trying various substances without thinking my decisions through. I consider myself quite experienced with marijuana, and I have had experiences with alcohol, Ritalin, Benadryl, PCP, Codeine, Vicodin, Lorazepam, and Ambien.<br>
<br>
I first heard about Salvia last August when my friend Josh told me about it, and said he wanted to try some. I told him I had never heard about it, and I decided to look it up. I had recently taken to researching different drugs and their effects, I find it very fascinating. I spent hours reading experience reports and reading information about the legal herb on various websites. A few days later, coincidentally, I was with a few other friends, and we were trying to buy me a pipe, on the Ave. All the head shops on the street rejected us, so we walked towards Thomas’ house, but noticed on the way one more shop. We walked in, and I noticed that all the pipes were over 20 dollars, which we could not afford. However something immediately caught my eye, a sign labeled “Purple Sticky Salvia”, sold here.<br>
<br>
I inquired and the man working there gave me package of it, the 5x extract in a round purple disc. He asked for ID, and I told him that my car had gotten stolen, and he pretended to believe me. We purchased the package and left. I told Josh that whenever I got any, I’d save it to smoke with him. A few of my friends left, and I slept over at Thomas’ house. I could barely sleep because I was so excited about it. When I finally woke up I decided to just try it before I met up with Josh. I loaded up a relatively large bowl into Thomas’ glass pipe, and took one large hit holding the lighter over the bowl the whole time. I held it for about 15 seconds before I coughed it all out. I felt nothing so I finished off the bowl in one last monster hit. I exhaled after about 10 more seconds and felt nothing. I decided that it was just a useless overrated legal high, but with some doubt since so many strong experience reports were on the internet.<br>
<br>
We left the house and met up with our friends Michael and Sam. They both had heard about Salvia and wanted to try it. I told them that it was supposedly very intense and they had to hold the lighter over the bowl the entire time, and hold the smoke very long. Michael took a considerable hit and held it for quite a while. He exhaled and put down the pipe slowly. He looked around suspiciously and I asked if he was okay. He said that he felt something but it was very strange. Sam reached over to grab the pipe and Michael cringed backwards. Afterwards Michael could not explain what had happened and said it was very subtle but interesting. I told them I wanted to save the rest for when I met with Josh.<br>
<br>
-Experience One-<br>
<br>
I got on the bus later that day and walked from the stop to Josh’s house. When I arrived he was in his room listening to music. I told him I had a packet of salvia and he freaked out. We went to his backyard and made a pipe out of a can, since we didn’t have a real one. His backyard was a sort of Zen garden, his Mom is into meditation and such. It was a sunny day and I felt nice and relaxed, kind of doubting the herb’s abilities, considering my experience that morning. I loaded a considerably sized bowl onto the can, and lit it up, smoking the entire thing in one hit, and holding it as Josh counted.<br>
<br>
I loaded another small bowl as I was holding the smoke. I exhaled the monster hit when Josh got to 30. It was not very harsh like it was in the morning. I immediately took another semi-large hit from the new bowl as I exhaled. I held it for about 15 seconds this time, and lay down on the gravel. It was very rocky, but I soon felt comfortable.<br>
<br>
I don’t remember how, but I was pulled into a white area, where I could see a blue fuzzy maze of thoughts, and I flew to points in my own head every time a thought crossed my mind. It was a strange sensation, almost like being reduced to the size of a pinhead, and swimming inside my own brain. Josh asked me if I was okay, and I told him to go away and said he was “ruining it”. I sounded quite violent, I remember, but I didn’t want to hurt him at all, he was just pulling me out my salvia-space.<br>
<br>
As I opened my eyes (which I didn’t remember closing) I saw the trees leading up to the sky in a sort of octagon shape, and this turned into a dark red and ominous circus tent. I was transported there, where I saw the robot-devil from the show Futurama. It sounds far fetched, I know. There was a door on each side of the octagonal room, and the devil exclaimed in his whiny and obnoxious voice “PICK A ROOOOM, ANY ROOOM!” I wasn’t confused, however I was completely oblivious to the fact that I had taken any drug at all.<br>
<br>
Inside the first room was a memory of me making a dream catcher with my father when I was about the age of two. There was no way for me to remember this in sobriety, but when I later explained my room in the apartment, which we only lived in for a few months, she said that my description was very accurate. “Something” told me how this event has affected my personality, but I don’t really remember how. I found myself back in the tent, with no devil to be seen. I explored the other seven rooms, and found more memories and their effects on my personality. I cannot really remember what they were, I’m not sure why.<br>
<br>
As I got back to the tent after the final room, the devil was there yet again, and told me “Shhhh,” and disappeared. A mysterious old black woman, much like the one from the Matrix trilogy, grabbed my hand and flew me through the top of the tent. I saw all of the trees surrounding yet again and looked at Josh. I had no idea what had just happened. I got up and didn’t talk for a few minutes, as I regained my bearings on reality. I felt pleasantly drunk, and explained what happened vaguely to josh.<br>
<br>
He was eager to try, and we loaded him a bowl and he smoked it in one hit. He lay down and kept his eyes open the whole time. He told me he saw acorns raining from the trees but disintegrating as they hit him. He looked over and saw little kids playing in his tree, laughing together. I proceeded to take another last hit, finishing off the salvia, but this time I just felt more disoriented, and I did not get pulled into another world. We sat in his garden and thought for a while, and since we were out of salvia, we smoked some weed and watched a movie.<br>
<br>
-Experience Two-<br>
<br>
One night a couple months ago, my friends Dave and Garret told me they had Salvia, so I snuck out to meet them. They also had weed and some Mike’s Hard Lemonade. I drank some of the Mike’s, and then sat down to smoke a bowl of the weed with them. As soon as it was done, I told them to bust out the Salvia. I was a bit anxious to try this in the dark, as I had done it in the daytime before. I took a big hit, and held it as long as I could before exhaling. Nothing happened, and I told him to load a bit more. I took another big hit, and exhaled, but this time I didn’t clear the bowl. So I took one more big hit and got some nice hot ash in my mouth.<br>
<br>
I felt like I was being pulled down, but that feeling soon passed as I saw the horizon turn into multicolored lines, much like the ones of the maze in my first experience, but this time it was on a black background instead of a white one (Night and day?). I began to feel like I was surfing on the lines, almost like flying in a dream. These visuals soon managed to turn themselves into a blank blue wall, on which there was a diamond shaped wooden object protruding from the walls with space in the middle. There was a hamster or a mouse or something representing myself inside it, and soon the blue wall turned into a sort of coal mine like area, and the diamond shaped object began sliding down the mine, and I hit a wall.<br>
<br>
I felt as if I was going through the seven stages of grief. These are Shock, Denial, Bargaining, Guilt, Anger, Depression, and Acceptance. At first I was quite wierded out and not believing this was really going on at all. But soon I just began denying to myself that I had taken a drug and this was just a dream, and I broke through the wall. The diamond kept sliding down the mine, and as it did something began talking to me. I told it to let me go, but it wouldn’t, and I felt like I made an awful decision for taking a drug at all. I was angry with myself and feeling very trapped and like I’d never come back down.<br>
<br>
But as I broke through the second to last wall, I felt a ray of hope, and realized that I'd some down eventually. I hit the last wall, and nothing happened. I waited, and talked to Dave and garret while this was going on, even though all I could see was the mine. Soon the wall broke open and I saw them yet again. I was amazed and shocked at how intense that experience was. It was almost like grieving for the death of my own ego.<br>
<br>
We left, and started walking towards our friend Phil’s house. I felt like I was on autopilot, very numb and my mind was clouded but happy. I had a burst of euphoria and stared at a streetlight and ran around in a four-way intersection, then hugged a stop sign, thinking it was the only thing that I could really connect to. Soon after this we decided to part ways and I walked home. I got in fine, even though I was quite stoned and still feeling the salvia.<br>
<br>
-Experience 3-<br>
<br>
Today, I had the most profound Salvia experience I’ve had, and it is what prompted me to write all of this in the first place. I was with a few of my friends on the Ave again, and I decided to run over to store I got the first salvia package at and grab a disc of the Purple Sticky Salvia 5x again. I purchased it, and went home. It had been waiting in my drawer for about a week, and I told josh I had another pack of it. <br>
<br>
This morning I slept in quite late, until 2:00, and I was drifting in and out of vivid dreams. I called josh, and he came over a half hour later. I felt at ease, and told my mom we were going to get a bite to eat. She left, to my surprise so I called her and asked when she was going to be back. She said she was taking my sister downtown and wouldn’t be back for about an hour. Josh and I decided to just smoke it undercover in my backyard, which was very visible and not such a great idea. I loaded a small bowl and I knew that I was about to experience something big, but I did not hesitate, and something told me to just smoke it.<br>
<br>
I pulled in the smoke fast and hard and I didn’t even feel it burn at all. I held it in for about 20 seconds before I exhaled hard. Josh asked if I felt anything, and I said yeah, go over there. I pointed to the opposite side of the yard. I realized it was raining, and I laughed and said oh yeah you don’t want to get wet, when he just scooted over under the cover. I proceeded to say “Holy shit I’m about to be fucked up!” Everything became quite wavy and weird, and I lost my sense of self. I suddenly found myself watching a very hard to explain person living, and I kind of felt like they were me, but soon I sort of “zoomed out” and saw that my hands were touching a large mysterious circle, and I was standing on a grass hill.<br>
<br>
I saw that there was another person standing quite close with his hands touching the circle. I realized I was seeing something I was not supposed to see. I was intrigued and looked deeper into the circle. I soon realized that everyone was connected to the circle, and their futures all come together in the center of the circle. The center represented something like the end, or maybe god. Either way I was scared beyond words and I could not bring myself to look at the center itself, for fear that it would essentially be a “spoiler” of my future.<br>
<br>
I found myself back with the people on the outside, but things had changed. I was now in a warehouse with many little worker type things connected to everything. I saw them all and they didn’t know how to help a panicked thing like me, and they ignored me. I looked over at Josh, who was laughing at me. He was the first thing I could remotely make up that was in reality. I saw his nose become the very point of the body of time or space or material. I moved closer to it, and his faces became numerous and were bestowed upon the many workers.<br>
<br>
I then noticed a void between his nose and upper lip, where a worker was absent, and a switch was not flipped. The surrounding workers laughed at me, knowing I was going to discover the void. At this time, my neighbor pulled in the drive way (I was not aware), and Josh got up and tried to get me to snap out of it and come inside. All of the playdohey workers began turning into more than just faces, and I felt workers grow where my mouth was, and I suddenly took a large breath. Josh grabbed my hand and it was slightly wet, and I felt all the water workers appear around me. I was being pulled into reality a bit too quickly, and I was very disoriented and afraid of what I’d just seen.<br>
<br>
He brought me into my house, and I sat at the kitchen counter. I was very out of it, and trying to make sense of what I had seen, and what I was seeing at the time. I had lost all sense of sobriety while in salvia-land, and I felt like I had been ripped apart into a puzzle made of the workers, and someone else came and put the workers back. However many of them were out of place and I didn’t feel the same as before. I tried to recount my experience to Josh, but I could not explain it very well. I asked if he wanted to smoke some and he said sure, so we went to my bathroom since the neighbors were home, and as he was getting ready to smoke it, my dad pulled in the drive way. Talk about everything going bad fast.<br>
<br>
We put it all away, and started listening to music. I just thought for a while, and it was quite a strange feeling to be back in my own mind again. I still have a feeling that I was ripped apart and put back together, sort of like the movie timeline, where the characters are ripped apart and put back together in order to transport them through space and time. I then went to dinner with my family, and josh went home. I came home and decided to write this report, and here I am now.<!--   End Body   -->

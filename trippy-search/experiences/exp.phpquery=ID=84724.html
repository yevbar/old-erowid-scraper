<!--   Start Body   -->


Let me start off with a warning:<br>
<br>
JWH-018 in its pure state is deceptively fluffy, and should be taken into account when measuring a dose. Not having a scale, I had to eyeball what looked to be about 1/8 tsp, I would guess somewhere between 3-6mg. This turned to be waaaaaaaayyyyy too much for myself, as explained below.<br>
<br>
I have been a daily user of cannabis for a good part of about 4 years, but due to recent life changes, have not been able to procure or be allowed to smoke the good herb for about 4 months or so now. I've always been somewhat of a lightweight when it<br>
comes to pot, and could never smoke the quantities that any of my friends could. I guess that the same applies to JWH-018, <br>
<br>
Although I must reiterate that the dosage I took was eyeballed and my no means an accurate or smart way of taking this compound. It is similar in consistency and color to Baking Powder, yet slightly more fluffy, and has a bit of a slippery effect to the way that it moves around. It is basically pure white.<br>
<br>
I was so excited after hearing all the good reviews on Spice blends and other people who've used pure JWH, that I was very excited to try this stuff out. So, after receiving it in the mail only 4 days after I ordered it (including a weekend), I couldn't wait to try some. I packed a bowl with a small amount of Wild Dagga, which, even in large quantities, does not produce much of an effect on me. I then sprinkled on about 1/8 tsp of the pure JWH-018 powder and toked and held the hit in for a good 30 seconds. <br>
<br>
Initially, I did not feel any effects until about 4-5 min after smoking, I'll list out events in a chronological list.<br>
<br>
T-0:00 - Smoked 1 medium size pinch of wild Dagga, and approx. 1/8 tsp pure JWH-018 powder. The powder melted right away, and I had to burn the rest of the dagga to get it all.<br>
<br>
T+0:05 - Initial effects were starting to be felt, and felt almost exactly like taking a couple good bongs rips of some good weed, like Haze or the like. A little head high, increasing more into a body high.<br>
<br>
T+0:06 - Went to take a shower, and I started to feel REALLY high, like I had smoked wayyyy to much weed (for myself anyway). I started to feel a dry mouth effect, except it was more like I was tasting everything. I tried some mouthwash to give my mouth<br>
something to focus on. I started to feel kind of dizzy, and my vision was very vertigo like, with my point of view being pulled away a bit from everything else. Almost like my neck stretched out a bit and viewing angel became wider. At this point I had my eyes closed while washing up, and could still feel an almost boat-like rocking to the effect, which I had experienced a number of times before when smoking too much pot. It may have been a flashback-like effect, but I'm starting to feel anxiety/panic about<br>
getting caught using this stuff.<br>
<br>
T+0:11 - Turned off the water, but had to stand in the shower for a minute to try and calm my body down by grabbing the shower bar and leaning my head on the wall staring down the grout lines to try to steady my vision; anxiety is increased. At this point I <br>
also feel my heart (or so I thought; explained below) starting to increase very rapidly, along with the rocking speed that I'm feeling as well. So I dry off, and get dressed rather slowly, with a noticeably increased loss of coordination and balance. I am also 'tasting' the feeling of my clothes being put on, which is very unpleasant, but not something I haven't experienced before with pot. I try rinsing with more mouthwash, which decreased in effectiveness than 5 min ago. I make my way into my room at this point and sit/lay down in my big armchair, and try to slow my heart rate down with some breathing exercise to force myself to breathe slower.<br>
<br>
T+0:20 - Heart rate still feels like it is increasing, as well as my respiration rate, and my heart feels like its going to pound out of my chest. I feel my veins pulsating with my heart, and almost feels like they're swelling twice the size. I was supposed to<br>
leave at this point to pick up my girlfriend, and decided it wasn't going to happen just yet, as I felt EXTREMELY stoned and did not feel ok to drive. I go from a somewhat fetal position to inadvertently flopping over to more on my back. I was trying to use the stillness of my surroundings to bring myself down from this, but to little avail. I slowed my heart rate down slightly, as well as my breathing, but it quickened again soon after.<br>
<br>
T+0:35 - Feeling a little more controlled, and determined, because my girlfriend has been waiting to get picked up for a bit now, I decided that I would go and leave. So I get some socks on, and go to leave. But about 1-2min after standing up, I started feeling nauseous, and threw up a little in my mouth and I did my best to bring that back down. I knew at this point, from past experiences, that the inevitable was about to happen. So I go downstairs and ended up vomiting everything I could out of my stomach.<br>
<br>
T+0:50 - After throwing up for a good 20-25 min, I try to regain my composure which is near impossible at this point. My heart feels like its going at least double the speed of normal, like I had just ran up 4 flights of stairs, and feels like it is going to beat right out of my chest. My veins still feel throbbing, and I feel very weak overall. I grab a bottle of scope and am laying on the bathroom floor at this point, with my hand losing grip to just keep it on top of the bottle. I am starting to think to myself that this is not normal, and that I might have to tell someone to bring me to the hospital, because it felt like my heart would explode, or that it would bring on a heart attack or something.<br>
<br>
T+1:05 - I am gradually picking myself up off the floor, while at the same time trying to clean myself up. About this time, my mom comes downstairs because she thought I had left, but then saw my car still here. I tell her that I just got really sick, and that <br>
I think it was some leftover ham that I had eaten before, which may be possible, but unlikely that it was the cause of this.<br>
<br>
T+1:15 - I bring myself back upstairs and immediately go sit down in the living room, unable to do much else. I feel very weary at this point from getting so violently sick, and also a little bit from the drug. My mom gets me a can of ginger ale, and some<br>
pretzels, which seemed to help some, which is a relief at this point. I told her I felt very dizzy and that it felt like my heart was racing. As I was explaining this to her, I was trying to hold back the scared feeling that I was going to die, and I got that little quiver in your bottom lip when it almost feels like you're going to cry. I had her get the blood pressure monitor that she uses.<br>
<br>
T+1:20 - My mom takes my blood pressure twice, and to great surprise, my blood pressure and heart rate are perfectly normal. Both of the readings were: 120/72 pulse 90 & 121/72 pulse 92. That is a normal resting blood pressure reading although the pulse was a tiny bit high. Normally, just sitting I would be somewhere between 80-85. A little shocked, but very relieved that I'm not going to die, I continue to sit for a while. My girlfriend called to see how I was doing and she said that she got a ride back home and that I should stay home because she didn't want to get sick either. <br>
<br>
T+1:45 - After eating about a dozen thin pretzels and drinking half a can of ginger ale, I decided to go in my room, as I'm feeling much better. I did some stuff I needed to do for work, and just layed down in my chair again and put on the Ambient Beat genre on shuffle in Winamp (mostly Boards of Canada and Shpongle).<br>
<br>
T+2:30 - I am passed out at this point pretty much. I am resting, but opened my eyes a couple of times, and I was shocked at how fast time was going.<br>
<br>
T+7:30 - I wake up after what felt like a 1-2 hour nap, but it ended up being about 5 hours.<br>
<br>
T+7:45 - After eating a little bit more pretzels with some hummus now, I started to write this out, because I decided at the beginning of my trip that I needed to.<br>
<br>
T+8:20 - As of right now while finishing this, I still feel mildly stoned, even after my nap, although I'm relaxed at this point.<br>
<br>
Let me finish this off by saying that this compound is not something to be messed with lightly, as I'm sure if I had taken more that what I did, I wouldn't be writing this. That's how scared I had gotten. People have stressed about using a .001g sensitive scale to measure out a dose, which I would also recommend. Despite the negatives effects of this trip, I find it a very good learning experience to say the least, and that it is about 95% identical to the effects of some really good cannabis. <br>
<br>
I am definitely going to try this again tomorrow, but in a MUCH MUCH smaller dosage. Contrary to my own advice I am going to eyeball out about a 1/4 of the amount I had today, and see how that goes, and take it from there.<br>
<br>
I can't stress enough to be EXTREMELY CAREFUL with the dosage as this is very potent stuff. If it looks like too much, it probably is. I would start off not using more than can fit onto the first 3/32' of an Xacto blade. Again an approximation, use your own judgment. Or better yet, weigh out 200mg on an appropriate scale.<br>

Maybe I should start by telling something about myself. I'm a seventeen year old boy. I'm in Senior High School. I'm interested in physics, arts and so on. Before my first 5-MeO-DIPT experience I have tried substances like: LSD, MD(MA/A/EA), GHB and THC. Most of my experiments were with LSD.<BR>
<BR>
OK, but now, let's get down to business. I was going to a rave which was being held deep down in the forest. All looked good and I hadn't even thought of taking any psychedelic, etc. All of a sudden, it started to rain alot. People were still dancing, though, including me. I had heard that a sort of friend of mine had 2C-T-7 with him at the party. After a while I went to him and asked did he have the substance. He said no. I had also heard that he had a tryptamine called 5-MeO-DIPT with him, so I asked did he have that. He said yes and I bought 30mg of the substance.<BR>
<BR>
I had read about 5-MeO-DIPT before. I based my information on the books like TiHKAL and various websites on the net. After a while I put the two capsules (10 mg each) into my mouth and swallowed them down with some water. I knew that it was pretty high dose, but I also knew that I was going to handle it OK.<BR>
<BR>
After a while I started to feel something. That little itching feeling in the back of my neck, knees, elbows and wrists. I thought that I should get home and do some intensive research (notes, etc.) before the trip started for good. I managed to get a ride, but unluckily my ex-friend wanted to come with the same car. I thought that it was OK and we started walking to the car. <BR>
<BR>
While we were walking from the forest to the parking lot we went by a semi-large pond. As I told, it had just been raining and there was some steam over the pond. Trees were green and the atmosphere was a little bit foggy. All of a sudden, I started to hear voices of grasshoppers, parrots, insects and monkeys. It was pretty strange, because I live in Finland and there are no parrots or monkeys around here, but I knew that it was OK because it is known that 5-MeO-DIPT causes some auditory hallucinations. I smiled and kept going on, carrying a sleeping bag in my hand. We ran into some people who were going in the opposite direction (to the party, that is). I smiled to them all, huge grins. They were not so happy about that, because of the rain. They probably didn't enjoy the rain as much as I did.<BR>
<BR>
When we got back to the car I went to the back seat and I didn't talk until after about 25 minutes when we were at the front of my apartment. Then my friend did the thing that made the trip a nightmare. He had taken 10 mg of the substance and said that he couldn't go home, because he was too 'fucked up' to be straight. I was pretty amazed, because I was feeling pretty sharp although I took twice as much as he took. Well, I wasn't sure that I wanted him to come with me, but he kept on pushing and pushing and after a while he was at my apartment. I was (frankly) pissed, because I had some plans for the evening (as I said, I wanted to make notes, etc.).<BR>
<BR>
Well, he kept going on with loads of nonsense. He kept talking about things that I really didn't want to hear. TV programs, etc. (I don't even watch TV, I hate the whole thing.) I listened to him and told him that he would really have to go. He didn't leave my apartment.<BR>
<BR>
I put on a vinyl (The Moody Blues) to my record player. The auditory hallucinations were amazing. I tried to analyze them, but it wasn't easy, because of my friend. The visual hallucinations got stronger. I saw the pictures of the outlines of lotus flowers running thru various parts of me. They didn't appear on the walls or anything elsewhere. Just in my hands, legs, face (I looked into a mirror), and so on. I tried to find the ground zero of the 'flowers' but I didn't manage to find it, because I had to blink my eyes.<BR>
<BR>
As I said, I had tried LSD before. The 5-MeO-DIPT reminds me a lot of LSD. Only the auditory hallucinations are different. Because of my friend's stupid and annoying stories and so on, I came to the conclusion that 5-MeO-DIPT was a hillbilly brother of LSD. I felt myself so stupid at that moment. I can't describe the feeling, but it was awful. I was seeing pictures of hillbilly farmers in my mind and I really started to feel bad. I went to shower as fast as I could to remove the images of my friend and other hillbillies from my mind.<BR>
<BR>
I took off my clothes and looked into the mirror. Again, I saw lotus flowers all over my body. I smiled to my mirror image and went into the shower. It was fabulous. I thought I could feel every single drop of water on my body. And of course, the sounds were amazing. When I took some water on my mouth and spit it to the floor, the sound came about 3 seconds after I saw the water hit the floor. And the distance between my head and the floor seemed huge. Well, I washed myself, dried myself, put on some clean clothes and went back to my room, where my unwanted friend was still lying on my bed.<BR>
<BR>
I explained to him that my trip was going to be a bummer because of him, and told him that I could help him to get home. He said that he didn't want to go home. Well, I told him, we could take a walk. He didn't want to take a walk. I gave him lots of options, but he didn't like any of them. Then I just said that I really want him out of my apartment, because I was feeling really bad with him. He still didn't leave the house.<BR>
<BR>
After 3 hours, I finally managed to get him out of the house. But then, I was feeling so bad (mentally) that I tried to cheer up by reading some book. I read about 20 pages of physics and felt a little bit better. The time was 9 AM, and I thought I should get some sleep before I should go and do my laundry 12 AM. I was tossing and turning in my bed for about 30 minutes before I managed to get some sleep. I slept for 6 hours and woke up. I was feeling really bad. I was feeling all dirty and sweaty (I didn't sweat actually). I went to the shower again and I was feeling pretty OK, just a little bit 'numb', but OK.<BR>
<BR>
That was my 'not-so-great' 5-MeO-DIPT experience. I know why it wasn't so great. I had lousy set & setting and I was pretty tired during the trip. I still have 10 mg of the substance left in my freezer and I have plans to try the stuff out after a couple of weeks or so. On a sunny day, all alone. I think that the substance has a lot of potential of becoming the 'new' LSD. That actually scares me just a little bit. If the substance will spread all over the streets, it's going to be banned for sure. Let's just hope and act smart so that the social 'LSD effect' doesn't happen on this substance, because we have lots of studying to do.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks and have a great Independence Day,<BR>

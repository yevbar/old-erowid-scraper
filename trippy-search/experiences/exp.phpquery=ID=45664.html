In Sweden we all celebrate midsummer's eve, summer solstice, the longest day of the year. Usually we celebrate it by drinking ourselves silly. Personally I dislike binge drinking. I don't get sick very easily, but drinking myself into a stupor is not something I enjoy. But there was this one night when everything went a bit out of hand.<br>
<br>
I was down in the south of Sweden with my now ex-girlfriend, whom I'll refer to as B, and her brother, F. We were just hanging out in the countryside doing nothing, so when midsummer's eve came around and we were invited to a party in a nearby town we became real eager to go. F is a habitual hash smoker, and had brought with him his entire stash of really high-grade hash and a few nice buds of skunk weed. A few nights before midsummer's eve we had shared a joint of his most powerful gear. This might have influenced the events which follow.<br>
<br>
At midsummer's eve we brought with us one bottle of white wine for me, a bottle of vodka for us three (me, B and F) to share, and F brought a lot of hash and some buds. I can't really remember the night in any kind of chronological order, which is normal for me when drunk, but I think we started off just drinking wine and relaxing to some good music. Smoking a joint in the house where the party was at was out of the question, so we just kicked back and waited for an opportunity to present itself. Me and B finished the wine and started mixing our vodka with 7Up and lime.<br>
<br>
F disappeared upstairs with some girl, which made me a bit disappointed since I had been looking forward to smoking a joint soon. I thought he'd be gone for the rest of the night. Maybe an hour later I popped outside for a cigarette and sat down to watch some people practice fire spinning (poi) in the back yard. Suddenly F materialised by my side.<br>
<br>
'You wanna smoke a cocktail?' he asked with a goofy smile.<br>
<br>
I went inside and got B, and we ran across the street to the parking lot behind a hostel there. F mixed us a cocktail, a combination of weed and hash, and we started smoking. I had never done something so potent before. I choked constantly on the thick grey smoke. After two puffs my lungs started to feel like two bars of molten lead. Then it hit me. In an instant my mouth turned bone-dry, I lost every semblance of depth perception and my head started spinning. I had brought with me a huge cup of 7Up and vodka, and it tasted so good. It was the most amazing thing I'd ever tasted.<br>
I drank all of it as fast as I could. Mistake number one. There was a lot of vodka in there. F roached the joint (he had smoked maybe two thirds of it by himself) and we headed back to the party. By then everybody in there was blind drunk, so we fit in perfectly.<br>
<br>
This is where stuff really went wrong. I mixed up another drink, severely misjudging the amount of vodka I put in it. I drank it down in one big, thirsty gulp and proceeded to seek out some munchies. Meanwhile, F was chilling in the back yard watching the fire spinners, and B was lying on her back in a walk-in closet, tripping off the cocktail. After a couple of handfuls of tasty peanuts the alcohol hit me like a freight train. My head spun like some crazed gyroscope. It was hard even to stand up. My legs just wanted to fold themselves, my arms were out of control. Strangely enough I was completely unafraid. My body was messed up beyond recognition but my mind felt clear and sober.<br>
<br>
I staggered to the bathroom and slumped down over the toilet bowl. However I willed myself I couldn't throw up. Since I rarely need to I've never learned how to induce vomiting by sticking your fingers down your throat. But in the fugue state the cocktail had put me in I could visualize it, a clear vision of my mouth and my throat from the side, and where my fingers should go.<br>
<br>
It worked like a charm. After cleaning myself up and drinking maybe a litre of water I left the bathroom and met B and F who had been looking for me. Together we staggered to a bus station to catch a bus home. Along the way I threw up several times. Normally I hate doing that, but in the state I was in I didn't care. It didn't feel good or bad, it just happened. The bus ride home was completely uneventful. I think I must have fallen asleep. Getting off the bus and walking home left me feeling almost sober. When I woke up the next day I wasn't even that hung over. Just a little lethargic and clumsy.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't consider it irresponsible that I drank so much alcohol that night. It was more of a mistake. I didn't stop to think at all, I just kept on rolling. Not meaning to sound like a cliché, but marijuana is an introspective tool for me. After this night I realised that something that some people party on might be something that I'd rather meditate on. I think I'm wired like that. And this midsummer's eve last year really taught me a lesson about how my body works.<!--   End Body   -->

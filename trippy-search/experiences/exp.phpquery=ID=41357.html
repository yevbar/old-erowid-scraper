So I tried this stuff again...  see my first experience called 'White Knuckle Ride'.  That was with my girlfriend, this time a friend of mine, X, had heard all baout DMT and wanted to try it.  I wanted to have a hallucinatory experience, but nothing to the intensity of my first experience.  I halved the dose of that trip.  Here's how it went...<BR>
     <BR>
I weighed out 7 grams of syrian rue seeds, and 10 grams of mimosa hostilis bark.  I boiled the seeds in two cups of water with just a splash of some disgusting citrus juice, which I regret doing because it was horrible juice.  This tea turns brownish, like weak coffee but tasted like really bad coffee.  I filtered that and put it in the freezer to cool it down.  <BR>
     <BR>
I broke up the piece of bark into as many pieces and fibers as I could.  I boiled these in two cups of water with a splash of citrus juice.  This tea turns a dark red, a very nice berry color actually with not such a bad taste.  I filtered this and put in the freezer to cool down. When the teas cooled down to 'still warm', we put a little sugar in the rue tea and drank it down slow.  Probably over 10 minutes.  It took about a half hour to begin to feel warm and cozy and lazy.  Then we went to the mimosa tea.  It could be drunk by itself, but we added juice to make it more palatable.  I made sure to drink it over the course of ten minutes.  We have to take the DMT fast to get the rediculous onset, but if we spread it out over a few minutes, we would feel those nice wavees of insect buzzing at each gradual onset.  Though what seems to happen is that most of it hit me at once, then the rest slowly seeped in.  <BR>
<BR>
It was about 20 minutes later, when the first onset symptoms appeared.  The excitement and apprehension that is.  But my friend felt nothing.  I was just about to be blasted into hyperspace balls first when I realized that I didn't really feel like doing this today.  There was 10,000 things I wanted to get done, this wasn't one of them.  The hallucinations were nice, not so much audio this time, a little bit of volume swell of outdoor random noises with my breathing, during onset.  There was the typical prismatics and swirling, melting patterns.  I followed my daydreams for a little.  The music was just agitating no matter what I put on.  I found some Phish though, and I was in bliss.  I got up and walked around numerous times.  After an hour, I went to the commode and experienced La Purga once again.  It was no shock this time, and I heard myself in my head saying to get rid of all the bad feelings and negative emotions.  And I felt my stomach pause and reach deeper and work up whatevere else was there.  I opened my eyes and looked at my vomit, and the bubbles were so pretty, and numerous and multiplying into a geometrical pattern.  I felt tears from the wretching.  I made this noise when I purged, like trying to expel demons from deep within my guts.  <BR>
<BR>
The beauty of DMT is that I get weak and strong points during a trip, like a cycle, and every single strong point feels like the most tripped out point of my life ever and also the most memorable psychedelic experience.  I was going hard.  I went back into the living room and fell onto this nice cozy opened up fouton.  I put on headphones and hid under a huge blanket.  I was listening to Pete Frampton.  It was rediculous, the music was great but the CEV's were so intense I just kept asking to turn down the intensity.  It was just too much to enjoy.  It's akin to pretty lights being too bright and great music making your ears bleed.  It was just too much input.  And there's nowhere to go.  The rue made me so tired I wanted to sit in a trance with my eyes closed, listening to mtunes, but the DMT made me afraid to close my eyes.  The OEV's weren't so intense, phantom images and things' borders melting off.  The CEV's were usually patterns and the like and very little solid imagery or plot to follow.  I mentioned to my friend I would never do this again and he said 'yeah, that's what I say when I'm so tripped out'.   I wanted my xanax and he offered to bring me home to get it.  I told him by the time we got there the trip would be almost over though.  <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

We went for a nice pleasant drive to my house, about 15 minutes drive.  It was so nice, the sun was in and out, the snow would fall and not fall.  Hey that's how the weather is here.  It was a great day though.  Like I said, every high point is the best ever, and the car trip was nice because I got to escape and also the onset was over and trip was mellowing while the DMT was still coming in.  I was past the peak.  I crashed on my couch and listened to music after talking a mile a minute.  He watched basketball, felt virtually nothing... a psychedelic hardhead.  He decided to drive back to his hometown, 45 minutes away, at the last minute.  O wait!  He just IM'd me from his phone.  He said 'that was an interesting ride back!'  So I'm thinking it hit him a little bit on the way home.  Couldn't have been too intense.  But it sounds like he had fun.  Just took a couple hours to feel.  Anyway, 4 hours later, I'm alive, never took the xanax, feel good (just tired and lazy from the MAOI).  <BR>
     <BR>
Next time I do this, I am going to half the dose.  Also I am going to do the extraction with only water.  So there you go you psychedelic chefs.  No need to take longer than ONE boil to make your stuff.  I do it like this:<BR>
Crush my seeds in a piece of paper with a hammer<BR>
Shred the bark with coffe grinder, scissors, fingers or whatever<BR>
Boil each in separate pots<BR>
Cool teas<BR>
Taste, and modify taste<BR>

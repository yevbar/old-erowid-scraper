This is an account of the recreational use of Phentermine, which is supposedly similar to Amphetamines. The pills are 30mg. For this experience I am only taking 1 pill to see how my body reacts. Note: I have only had one experience with Methamphetamine and I was drunk at the time so I do not remember the feelings other than I could not go to sleep. Therefore, I have no real experience with stimulants to compare this to.<BR>
<BR>
11am – Have the day off so I decided to try Phentermine which my parent uses for weight loss. Decided to eat pizza first because the drug causes a loss in appetite.<BR>
<BR>
12pm – Took one dose of Phentermine 30mg orally.<BR>
<BR>
1pm - Not really feeling Euphoric, just a little “speedy” as I started to clean my room.<BR>
<BR>
1:30pm – Starting to feel a *very* mild sense of euphoria, a little mood uplift. Still cleaning room, it feels good when I clean.<BR>
<BR>
2pm - No Change – room is cleaned.<BR>
<BR>
3:30pm – Just played my guitar for an hour and a half still feeling the same, I have a feeling either this stuff is time released or that this is the “peak”. I am going to exercise now.<BR>
<BR>
4:00pm – Finished exercising, it felt great. I can’t tell if lack of fatigue was due to the Phentermine or just my muscles becoming more efficient. I still don’t notice much of a difference in mood. I am now going to study to see if I can concentrate better.<BR>
<BR>
11:00pm – Studying was a lot easier, my mind was able to absorb the information easier and I was able to concentrate better. Didn’t have an appetite (guess the pills work) but ate dinner anyway. I’m not tired but I need to force myself to go to bed.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, it was an interesting experience. I’m sure I had increased energy throughout the day not much euphoria but it would be interesting to increase the dosage to see if it brought about euphoric effects.<!--   End Body   -->

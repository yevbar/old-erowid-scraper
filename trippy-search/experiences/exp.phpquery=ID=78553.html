<!--   Start Body   -->


I had never gotten high on cough medicine until about 2 months ago.  I was bored and read that you could get high off cough syrup.  I went out and bought a 4oz bottle (300 mg) and drank it in my apartment.  It made me feel really comfortable and warm and happy, and it was fun to walk a little weird.  For two weeks I took 300 mg of DXM maybe twice a week until I started to notice that my body had built a tolerance to it, plus I was getting sick of drinking syrup, I just couldn't do it anymore.<br>
<br>
This is when shit turned bad.  I was doing research online and realized there were gel pills with DXM in them.  On a whim I went out and stole 2 bottles of them and took 600 mg before watching a movie with my dad, fully expecting the high to be as mild as the 300 mg high.  I was so wrong.  I got so messed up that I felt dissociation and when I tried to talk I sounded like a mummy and my dad thought I was just sleep talking when really I was trying to talk to him.<br>
<br>
Well, this experience was awesome.  I didn't know that cough medicine could get me as high as I had just been.  I continued to abuse.  For a day or two after each trip, I would feel “off”.  I would feel clumsy, forgetful, stupid, and not myself.  But I didn’t care.  For the next month and half I would steal Robo gel caps everytime I saw them.  I would be getting high 2, 3, 4 times a week, up to 900 mg at a time.  Several times my trip scared me so bad that I vowed not to do it again, but nonetheless, I couldn't help it, the experiences were just too intense and amazing.  I felt like I was tapping into my unconscious and finding the real me.  I became addicted to stealing.  I started stealing anything I could whenever I had the chance, in front of customers, at checkouts, I didn’t care.  I stopped hanging out with my friends because none of them were into drugs, especially not cough medicine.  Instead of hanging out on weekends, I’d take 700+ mg of DXM, crawl into the back seat of my car, put music on, and trip all night, stumbling back to my apartment hours later.  <br>
<br>
About a month or so into my abuse I knew that I needed help.  I have an addictive personality and my self-control isn’t the greatest, so I began to fear that I was going to get further and further into the abuse and end up hurting myself or even dying.  Then, things started to change.  I got arrested for stealing Robo gels.  I told myself this was what I needed and that I was not going to do them again.  That lasted a week (the longest I’d been sober in almost 2 months).  Then I went out and BOUGHT (for the first time in 2 months) my Robo and did 800mg.  The trip was ok, nothing special, but as I was sobering up, the most intense migraine I’d ever gotten hit me like a ton of bricks.  I was in so much pain that I was writhing and moaning and hallucinating.  I eventually passed out and woke up feeling fully recovered.  I laughed off my migraine and assumed it was just stress related.  <br>
<br>
Four days later, out of nowhere I got really nauseous and started to throw up.  My puke was a deep red, and looked like a mix between blood and robo gels.  This freaked me out since it had been so long since I had eaten anything red or taken Robo gel caps.  About a week later, I decided to trip again, but only 600mg this time.  Again, as I was sobering up, I was hit with another horrific migraine, this time worse than before.  I was literally tearing up and throwing up and buckled over in pain.  My vomit was the strangest shade of pink I’d ever seen, and was so overly salty that I knew something wasn’t right.  I took some Excedrin migraine and it helped.  I woke up again feeling perfectly normal.  <br>
<br>
It has been three days since that experience, and I am proud to say that I am done forever.  The migraines and vomiting have to be a sign that I am damaging my body.  It is a plea from my body to stop hurting it so much.  I am 22 and way too young to be destroying my body with a drug.  And this all happened in TWO MONTHS.  I don’t know what damage has been done but my memory is not as good, I am not as coordinated, and my stomach/appetite has not been right for some time now.  I hope my story will help someone in the future before they get too far into their addiction and have horrible consequences.  If they are going to abuse DXM, I am not here to stop them, just give advice.  I was once like those who read stories like these and thought to myself “that won’t happen to me…I don’t use as much or as often”.  There are people who use daily, far more than I have, for months and years at a time are seemingly “okay”, but who knows what damage there is that cannot be seen.<!--   End Body   -->

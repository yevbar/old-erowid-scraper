This past weekend I was lucky enough to try some d-alpha-methyltryptamine, AMT. This was my first experience with the drug, so I didn't know what to expect. I read over the previous trip reports on erowid, and me and W decided to take 40 mgs. <BR>
<BR>
We dosed around 6pm. Both of us were prepared for this to last 20 hours. Ingestion was done by gelcap. After ingestion, cannabis was smoked. I had no other chemicals in my body, and W had some allergy medicine he'd been taking. <BR>
<BR>
T+1 hour: I start feeling very speedy. We both sat on the porch and talked for the next hour or so. I was not only amped up, but I was very open to talk about what was on my mind. It wasn't the indepth stuff I like to talk about while on LSD or foxy, but rather just anything I had on my mind. I just wanted to talk. Very similar to an MDMA trip. <BR>
<BR>
T+2 1/2 hours: We moved down to the trip friendly basement, complete with blacklights and music (TOOL!!!!!!!!!). Then smoked more cannabis. At this point, the trip was turning very visual. My body went from being very speedy and X-like, to very visual, similar to LSD. My visuals continued to increase for the next couple hours. Everything was wavy. My mind was still very open to talking. At this point, I realize just how subtle this drug comes on. I was expecting for it to come on very suddenly and be very strong, but in contrast, the feelings just creep up on you, and never seemed to be very overwhelming. <BR>
<BR>
T+4 hours: My roommate gets home at this point, and takes some foxy, so he can trip with me and W. At 4 hours into the trip, I am on the verge of peaking, and am engulfed by visuals. Blacklight posters have lots of movement, and the ceiling is looking like water. W's experience is going similar. He too was surprised by the subtlety of the drug in showing its face. Music is also very pleasing to listen to. There does seem to be an auditory part of the trip, but not as intense auditory change as with foxy. After peaking I stayed at a full +++ for about an hour before declining. <BR>
<BR>
T+ 9 hours: At 9 hours into the new substance AMT, I decide to go to bed. I am a hardhead with most psychedelics and was skeptical of the 20 hours length of AMT.  So a very good 9 hour trip satisfied me. Most foxy or LSD trips never last anything over 6 hours. Laying in bed was very pleasing, as I had no anxiety about the chemical inside me or the way my body was reacting. <BR>
<BR>
Conclusion: This was a very positive experience for me. I had little to no negaitve effects. The visuals were great, and the mdma like first 2 hours were also very pleasing. My mind wasn't reaching to new depths, but the will to talk and release was worth it. I was in constant need to do something, and that something for us was smoking cannabis. I found cannabis and AMT had great synergy together. I encourage other tryptamine users to try AMT.<!--   End Body   -->

Just wanted to report on this trial...<BR>
<BR>
6:00PM<BR>
<BR>
After long day at work, began pyrolizing small amounts on tin foil (molded from a pill bottle) using lighter and glass tube.  Take your time...hold it in.  Effects come immediately...happiness, then within minutes, color amped up and some bubbling atmosphere.  Wait a few and finish 5-7mg.  Notice jaws closed tight but nothing like strong X and it diminished as I became aware of it.  Was able to go to the store (Asian), cool pastel and neon signs, cars, and, streetlights as I drive.  The whole reality is colorshifting, not paranoid.)<BR>
<BR>
Go back home and try out the instant cappachino.  Later I decide to watch a movie I had interest in.  THE MUMMY.... the love scenes were pubescent.  The effects were well playing out as I had imagined they would about 5 minutes before each event did happen.  The movie got me emotionally worked up.  During an intermission I dyed my eyebrows black (I am gay).  Started to feel some anxiety.  Mostly down from the experiment at 4hrs.  Hands cold, nausea, sinus drainage, cold, and dizzy.  Decided to go to friendly gay bar.  I got to top of steps leading to door and said...oh why...drove back home.  I played on the computer and was happy to chill at home relaxing now at 2hrs.<BR>
<BR>
The experience lasted much longer than I expected.  Colors and euphoria for 4 hours, then came the nausea and a cold uck feeling (anxiety attack).  This is not going to give me closed eye visuals like I see on very small amounts of shrooms (large amounts explode into fantasia).  It does however distort my body image pretty well for such a small amount that I tried.  Doesn’t make me horney like 4ACO DIPT.  Euphoria and good feelings lasted into following day.  Suggest taking it slow, a mellow show at the right dose.  Don’t pushit.<!--   End Body   -->

I have always had some symptoms of ADHD and at the age of 21,I decided to consult a psychiatrist. He gave me Efalex and later Xanax (alprozalam) in case it was anxiety. When both failed he prescribed Ritalin (methylphenidate) for me.<BR>
<BR>
The first time I took 10mg and after 30 t0 60 minutes, I started feeling my heart beeting a lot and after some time I felt euphoric. Everything seemed so good. I was doing exams at the moment and under the effect of Ritalin, I succeeded to study an entire four hours without stopping. I actually found studying a very pleasurable thing while under Ritalin ' s effect.<BR>
<BR>
The next day I felt the same with a 10mg pill. On the third day, I<BR>
again took a 10mg pill and felt the same. However when it's effect<BR>
finished I decided to take another one and it worked as well. The following morning I took another pill during the exam. It worked fine.<BR>
<BR>
However starting from the fourth day, Ritalin never produced its miraculous effect again. Instead of feeling euphoric, it started to make me anxious and restless. I increased dosages up to 60mg but it was even worse. I have tried paroxetine with it, alcohol, benzodiazepines, but it was all in vain. Ritalin never worked again!<BR>
<BR>
I started taking paroxetine everyday, and occasionally after having taken paroxetine (20mg/day) for a long time, I stop it suddenly. After a day or two I start feeling dizzy, and like having a fever. To my amusement during this SSRI withdrawal syndrome, sometimes Ritalin starts making me euphoric again (not as much as the first times).<BR>
<BR>
Can anyone explain this ?<BR>
<BR>
All I know, is that Ritalin intially seemed to be a panacea and the ultimate drug, but it turned out to be disappointing.<!--   End Body   -->

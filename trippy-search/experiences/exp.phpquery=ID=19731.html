I tried 2C-C at a small party that we held on a friend's birthday. There were approximately 10 people taking various substances in a relaxed and controlled atmosphere. I was the only one on 2C-C, though many of my friends were on 2C-I.<BR>
<BR>
The 2C-C came on gradually after about an hour. The exact point at which I noticed the 2C-C was obscured by a fairly intense Salvia experience, but otherwise the onset of 2C-C was simliar to an experience I had on 2C-T-2: nausea, agitation, and eye-popping visual disturbances. Fortunately, I had learned from prior experience and fasted for 8 hours prior to taking the 2C-C, so the nausea was not unbearable and I didn't vomit. <BR>
<BR>
The nausea subsided after half an hour or so, giving way to crazy open eye visuals. I wandered around the house wearing goggles & gloves and carrying an opened umbrella. The goggles somehow made the visuals that much more interesting.I had the vague impression that they had become the All Revealing Goggles of Truth and I tried to convince my friends of this. heh. <BR>
<BR>
After another half hour or so, the little elves tap-dancing on my optic nerves took a bow and vanished, and the visuals became less pronounced. It was about then (T+2:00) that the trip entered a VERY good phase. It felt a little like the nice numb feeling your spine gets on dexadrine, times 10^3 or so. All my muscles felt very relaxed, very tactile. I took off my gloves (gloves?) at some point and discovered to my delight that I had nerves on the tips of my fingers. This period lasted around 2 hours and fortunately coincided with the subsiding of my friends' trips. We all sat on the floor talking and laughing as we came back down to earth.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, I'd say that 40 mg was a little intense on the onset. 30 mg would probably be a better starting dose to calibrate with. I'd definitely recommend 2C-C to any enterprising experimenter.<!--   End Body   -->

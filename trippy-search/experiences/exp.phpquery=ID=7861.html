This was my second ayahuasca experience. The first about 2 weeks ago. This time i hadnt planned or prepared to do it. just decided to.<BR>
<BR>
I blended 1 rounded Tbl spoon Syrian Rue seed in a blender with about 20 Chacruna (P. viridis) leaves and 1 cup water. The seeds seemed to remain pretty much whole after this. Effects may have varied if the seed was more finely ground, I dont know. I then added another cup oh H2O, and a cup of pickle juice (i didnt have lemon juice and it was 3 AM).  I simmered it for about 10 minutes.<BR>
<BR>
It does taste pretty bad. Onset at about 15 min, with a heavy muscle stiffness and slight nausea. Things becoming 'odd'. Around the 30 minute mark I gave in the desire to hurl. After that, things rapidly increased.  walking was difficult and i was lying down most of the time. I quickly realized i was in salvia space.  I have smoked salvia extract several times  and while fascinating , it happens very fast and is hard to hold on to.<BR>
<BR>
Now ,presto, here i was in that same place, but with time to look around. Amazing. I realized it was the same because it is a real place. That was pleasant, but it was time to move on to another place. A place 1000 times more real and thousands of times more vast and amazing than my little monkey brain could have imagined.<BR>
<BR>
Here words get hard. but i was with 'them'. Whoever exactly 'they' were, im not sure. But it seemed that we had known each other forever, except for a few minutes while i was gone haveing a life on little ol planet earth. They were like children, and we played. These guys were laugh-a-holic merry makers. We played and played.  For no reason. Play was the ultimate.  They didnt need to do important, serious things.  It seemed that simple acceptance of existence  resulted in a joy  that manifested itself in its truest form in what i can only describe as play.<BR>
<BR>
When i say we played, i mean out there. Sometimes i would have to come back here and check in so to speak.  Like 'whats going on back there? is the house on fire? do i need to attend the needs of my body, like maybe i need to puke?' and then if i felt nausea, i would make the effort to get up and make the bathroom trek. But they would come back with me and still mess with me and try to play. And id be saying 'quit , quit' (cuz i need to concentrate to make it to the john) in a mock stern voice.  But you just cant help laughing at them. they are so funny. just an incessant barrel of monkeys showing funny crazy things.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So it was 2 or 3 hours out there , with 2 or 3 short trips back in. and it is so real out there. You are there. Believe that. While you are there this world seems so small, its like nothing.  Out there is like swimming in a sea of infinite aliveness.  Like this whole world is just a funny little insgnifigant blip on the vast cosmic radar screen.  Who knew? but, its real, and its right there. Drink some ayahuasca and you can see for youself.<!--   End Body   -->

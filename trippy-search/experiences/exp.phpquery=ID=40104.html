Tramadol Part 1: The First Trial<BR>
<BR>
Introduction<BR>
<BR>
I had read about Tramadol/Ultram as a synthetic opioid with fewer/less pronounced side effects than more traditional prescription opioids.  While traveling in Cambodia, I found myself in a “little boy in a candy shop” situation, the candy shop being a pharmacy/medical center with a very inviting pharmacist behind the counter...<BR>
<BR>
Originally intending to purchase effervescent Codeine lozenges, I was given free sway to the pharmacist’s small selection, and purchased several blister packs of ten capsules of 50 mg Tramadol at about $2(USD)/blister pack.  I also acquired two blister packs of ten blue tablets of 10 mg Diazepam for about the same price. <BR>
<BR>
Dose<BR>
<BR>
I considered myself to be well-acquainted with opioids – I was a regular user of Codeine, though I was accustomed to other higher potency opioids as well, in addition to several experiences with raw opium itself.  Thus, I felt 3 capsules (150 mg) might be sufficient for a moderately strong experience.  In addition, I took one tablet (10mg) of Diazepam which I let dissolve in my mouth (allowing a potentially quicker onset via sublingual absorption).  <BR>
<BR>
Set & Setting<BR>
<BR>
This would be my regular drug preference – a mixture of opioids and benzodiazepines; consequently I felt quite comfortable with the dosing and had no anxiety with ingesting a new opioid.  I was very relaxed to begin with – at the time I was living in Taiwan, and this was my first week of Chinese New Year vacation.<BR>
<BR>
I consumed my doses in the privacy of a guesthouse, and then my friend and I walked for about ten minutes to the beach.  This was a quieter and more secluded beach area in Sihanoukville, Cambodia.  A general lack of noise and people added to the peaceful setting, which was quite tranquil already – soft white sand, a clear and bright star-filled sky, the rhythmic surge of incoming waves.  A cool breeze came in from the Gulf removing the oppressive temperature and humidity felt in the town.  My mind and body were completely relaxed. My friend and I walked around the beach and rested on lounge-chairs set out in front of a few beachside bars and restaurants.  The occasional traveler would pass by, and usually nod in our direction.  A few food vendors came around selling bbq squid and fruit.  All non-threatening.  My friend consumed some alcohol, but was otherwise straight.  In the event of any problem, he would have helped out and/or protected me.  (There is a slight chance of potential danger with gun-toting locals in Cambodia, but being tactful and being in a group at night has always made things feel safer there).<BR>
<BR>
The Experience<BR>
<BR>
What transpired was an experience much stronger than I had expected...  <BR>
<BR>
Within 30 minutes: <BR>
I felt the mild but pleasant surge in my arms common to the onset of opioid drugs.  This was followed by an also familiar light-headedness.  At this point I felt “mildly high” in terms of a subjective high.  It was pleasant, and comparable to a large dose of pure Codeine.  I had heard reports of people describing a “rush” feeling in the early stages of Tramadol, but I did not experience this, perhaps due to the sedating effects of the Diazepam.  I was still able to walk, talk, and think clearly.<BR>
<BR>
30-60 minutes: <BR>
The pleasurable surge turned into a full body numbness and intensifying lightheadedness.  I was slightly dizzy, but I could still talk fluently, though my attention was shifted to the pleasantness of the night and I chose not to talk as much.  I was still able to think coherently, enough so to realize that this “moderate” high was probably still in the onset phase.<BR>
<BR>
60 minutes +: <BR>
I went ‘on the nod’.  I came in and out of this state for the next 3 hours or so.  I recall ‘waking’ several times and muttering all sorts of things.  My friend said I spoke about how beautiful everything was, and also said a lot of oddball eccentric things – as a writer, this would be somewhat typical of me.  While I was quite “opiated” as I like to call it, my friend noted that I was still speaking eloquently and intelligently, though more quietly, and with the characteristic “creaky” voice.<BR>
Moving from one area of the beach to another, I noted that I was quite dizzy, more so than with other opioids.  It was partially the high, though I’m sure walking in sand had something to do with this also.  <BR>
<BR>
We sat out on the beach for several hours looking at the stars, and occasionally talking.  Some kids came and talked with us for a while.  A woman selling squid came by – I ate some squid (unlike others, opioids have never subdued my appetite).  A very large long-horned beetle landed on me and I found great pleasure in watching and feeling it crawl up my leg.  At some point, I took off my sandals and walked out to the water and let the waves come in over my feet, which also felt very pleasurable.  <BR>
We walked back to our guesthouse and I had a pleasant sleep and felt fine the next morning.<BR>
<BR>
And In Retrospect... <BR>
<BR>
As mentioned, I was much “higher” than I had anticipated I would be.  The onset was quite pleasant, as was the plateau.  Those that don’t like the ‘nod in, nod out’ experience would not enjoy Tramadol, nor most opioids I would imagine.  On a subjective scale, I would rate Tramadol to have a similar onset, but lower-strength plateau than Oxycodone; however, the plateau lasted much longer than Oxycodone.  I would say the “high” was stronger than Hydrocodone, and slightly longer lasting.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, it was a great opioid experience.  Given the frame of mind and my location, I often think back to this night as one of the most beautiful nights of my life.<!--   End Body   -->

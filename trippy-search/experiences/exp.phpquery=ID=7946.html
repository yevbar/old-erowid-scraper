 I never really used the stuff for it's intended purpose, so once my eyes glazed over a small article about canned air being used as a cheap high, well, out came the can from hibernation which was my computer table drawer. I first read the cans ingredients wich was difluoroethane, presumably the active ingredient, read the warnings, then aimed the cans straw at my mouth. At this moment I pondered for a moment what I was about to do, previously my only drug use was cannibis, mushrooms,crack and cocaine but all in very moderate doses, (especially the last two). I said to myself we will try this once, gather information on it's effects and never fill my lungs with a substance i can hardly spell again. Then I depressed the trigger and cautiously inhaled the first breath, there was a slight shifting of the objects around me but nothing compelling, so i then inserted the straw in my mouth and releasing the air I filled my lungs to capacity and held. <BR>
<BR>
The resulting effects were like nothing i've ever done before, dizzy and light headed, relaxed but still focused, then I went for broke and took three more giant intakes holding each one for about five seconds with no breaks in between, I'd exhale and go right back on the straw, while holding the third charge in I became weak and laid back in my chair, the room was shifting and blue and white dots were consuming my perephial vision, the sound of my air conditioner was oscillating going, wu wu wu wu, then tunnel vision followed by a near blackout and extreme euphoria, waves of pleasure rolled through me as I fought to remain conscious. This was the sweet spot of the trip, once I got the timing right I would straddle the fine line between blackout and reality warming the can between my bare thighs between breaths. <BR>
<BR>
Finally after the can was three quarters empty I threw it on the floor and said that's enough. My lungs were burning as I collapsed on my bed and stared at the ceiling, deep thoughts about my life were being played in my head, I remember thinking about writing my mother a letter, telling her that because of her paranoia and panic towards anything out of the ordinary in the everyday pattern of life, I was being constrained by phsychological barriers preventing me from moving foreward and evolving as an adult, I also thought that I had inflicted irreversable brain damage on myself for the buzz seemed to take forever to wear off. <BR>
<BR>
Eventually I passed out and woke up with a slight headache and some mild nausea, accompanied by general lethargia and dull brain activity. I will probably never use inhalents ever again solely because of the severe damage to the brain.  Some RAM was definitely lost, along with some pride. I don't recommend trying this but if one were so inclined, one should exercise caution and have a sober friend present... later.<!--   End Body   -->

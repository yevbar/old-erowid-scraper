This is an account of my first, and so far only, mushroom experience.  Prior to this experience, I had been worried about my social addiction to marijuana, as not a day went by when I didn't yearn to get stoned.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, after discussing mushrooms with a friend who had previously tried them, I said that I was curious to try them sometime in the future.  A few days later, I got a call from that friend who told me that we could try them within a day.  After much indecision, I agreed, and headed off to his place, with the company of a few friends.<BR>
That night, I ended up eating a gram, as did my friend and two others.  I only really knew 2 of the other three trippers, and I hated one of them.  <BR>
<BR>
I guess it was about 15 minutes after eating that I suddenly realized that I was feeling a bit weird.  My feet went numb and I began to feel like I was a conduit for spiritual energy.  I had to move around a lot, because the spiritual energy shifted, and I wanted to stay in the flow.  I also began to see swirling geometrical shapes on the floor.  One of my friends, who was sober, asked me what I was looking at, and if I was hallucinating.  Although it seems odd to me now, I didnt think that I was hallucinating, that the patterns had always been there, I had just never noticed them.<BR>
Shortly afterwards, I had begun to feel energetic, and went downstairs to play the piano.  After a short discussion with the piano, I proceeded to play, and the music sounded so . . . euphoric.  I felt the sensation that someone was laughing just over my right shoulder, although no one was there.  I looked over my right shoulder and saw three spiritual entities, whom I assume to be manifestations of the universal conciousness (god, if you insist).  Oddly, I didnt pay them any attention, didn't attempt communication (I'm still kicking myself), and continued to play the piano.  <BR>
<BR>
After an incredible surge of energy which blasted me back to reality some 2 hours and thousands of anecdotes later, I had a moment of self reflection.  During the trip I lost my claustrophobia, lost my fear of spirits, lost my fear of dark, and lost my flinching reflex.  (Usually I flinch when someone snaps their fingers two blocks away, but during the trip I was immune to external stimulus.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now here comes my moment of pride:  After the trip I no longer even think about marijuana.  It went from the center of my life to just some waste of time that occasions me rarely.  It is now almost 3 months later and I have only been stoned twice, and only because I am apparently really fun to be stoned with, so my friends talked me into it.<BR>
<BR>
Aftermath:  More spiritual<BR>
            Lost several addictions (computer games included)<BR>
            Feel more confident, artistic, and creative.<BR>

Used: Peruvian Torch Cactus Cuttings boiled in 1 liter of water along with 1oz of powdered Peruvian Torch cactus.<BR>
<BR>
Method: Chew and Swallow.<BR>
<BR>
-------------------------------<BR>
| Began Ingestion at 5:04pm    |<BR>
| Finished at 5:19pm           |<BR>
-------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
5:53pm - Notices lights brighter and such.<BR>
<BR>
6:21pm - Head begins to get tingly, moving aross shoulders.<BR>
<BR>
6:31pm - Notice a light sense of giddyness.<BR>
<BR>
7:02pm - Somewhat blurred vision. Altered state of mind definately present, series of goosebumps all over        body quite often.<BR>
<BR>
7:59pm - Christmas tree flashed red and then back to green (the tree itself/without the lights), floor        looked, and moved like water.<BR>
<BR>
8:37pm - Computer screen wavey, lining of anything straight edged is moving...<BR>
<BR>
9:22pm - Visuals are definately present now. 'Breathing Walls', colorfull patterns, yet my mind still        seems clear-headed.<BR>
<BR>
9:58pm - Very intense now. Pulsing vision (objects growing large, then small in a pulsing fashion.) Hard        to type, or make out what is being typed.<BR>
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
[December 24th - The Next Day.] - This is where I was unable to continue updating the experience report live. So I am having to come back now and fill in the gaps.<BR>
<BR>
After my last entry, things became quite intense. I experienced what I would call a vision of sort. I saw three beings, or entities. One I understood its name to be 'The Everseeing Eye', and looked like a floating eyeball with eyelid turned on its side with a brownish-green aura around it. I understood it to be sort of the witness to the experience of mescaline. Like whether it is a good or bad experience, it is there to watch you. <BR>
<BR>
Another was what I understood to be, 'The One' and I understood it to be sort of like a judge over whether or not you will be blessed with a good or bad experience. It looked like some sort of Hawaiian ritual mask or something, a floating one that is.<BR>
<BR>
Then there was the last entity, the one I understood to be known as, 'Sin'. I understood it to be what 'The One' uses to grant you a bad experience if it deems you deserve it or not. 'Sin' looked like a completely black head with a cut in its forehead and one, red, menacing eye.<BR>
<BR>
These entities are what I understood to be the entities of the cactus. Before I had ingested the cactus, I said a quick Shamanistic Prayer, if you will to grant me a good experience and sure enough, I was given one.<BR>
<BR>
I spent the entire time after this vision drawing the entities and writing down everything I could remember from the vision before I was overwhelmed and forgot or something.<BR>
<BR>
After writing down everything I could remember, I put on some KoRn and listened to music for about 4 hours. <BR>
<BR>
The effects are still felt even as I type this. Mescaline is a very strong drug and should not be taken lightly.<!--   End Body   -->

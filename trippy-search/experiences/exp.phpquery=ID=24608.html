For some time I've wanted to try 2-cb, on Wednesday may 28th I finally got the chance. It came during a day off from work full of looking for a new place to live and weary feelings of not knowing if my girlfriend and I would be up for a trip at the end of the day. Eventually the end of the day did come and we decided to jump into the world of 2-cb in anticipation of what it would bring us. At 9:53, even though I was tired and hungry, moments later I found myself licking the off white power off a piece of tin foil. The taste was bearable if only it was not for a nagging aftertaste that crept up my throat. <BR>
<BR>
After my bitter chemical licking face wore off I found myself beginning my customary pacing about and tinkering with random things which accompanies me when trying a new compound. I was first thumbing through books, then checking on plants, walking around in circles, and trying to pick out some music. Finally I decided to get on the computer and make some music myself. <BR>
<BR>
At this point some 20 minutes into the trip I began to notice my first alerts. A kind of clear headed sensation somewhat akin to having a shot of vodka sailed along with me as I pointed and clicked my way through my favorite noise programs. This loosening of the gears of the mind lead me to some interesting musical ideas up until the point the 2-cb started to push further. <BR>
<BR>
My sense of vision had become somewhat agitated due to this enhancement. For the most part the computer screen had become very uncomfortable to look at. My sense of hearing had also become rather agitated, soon I could concentrate on nothing and got off my computer. What next? Painting? Reading? Massage? Sex? Nothing sounded interesting to me. <BR>
<BR>
I just sat there wondering what to do, waiting and listening for a voice to tell me what to do to relieve myself from this unmotivated place. The voice came in the form of my fan. Normally I'm very sensitive to sounds and I take that as a blessing but God Damn it was loud! It sounded as though there were three more fans in my room so I turned it off. A little better now, but what's this other noise I hear? It was my Windows computer. Blasted thing. It was so loud it was jarring my nerves just to sit next to, so off it went, but I left the Mac running.<BR>
<BR>
Soon my quest to eliminate all household noise had been completed and I lay next to my girlfriend who was quietly enjoying herself whilst reading a book. I got under the covers where slight patterns began rippling through my vision. Feeling content to lay back and dive into myself I began an attempt only to have it thwarted by a bright ass light!!! It was piercing through me, almost so bright that it was eating my inner most core. I needed darkness. <BR>
<BR>
Much to my relief my girlfriend kindly lit a candle only to have some sort of karmic trick played on me by having my room mate come home from a drunken potluck. I just wanted peace and quiet, but he brought loud guitar playing and singing. Normally I don't care as long as he keeps it down, but under the influence of 2-cb it sounded as though he had been turned up to eleven. *Sigh* Set & Setting right?????<BR>
<BR>
I sat there annoyed and stewing in my own juices. Half hiding my ears and eyes under a blanket and half holding a conversation with my girlfriend about equanimity and karmic law. This continued brooding let out quite a bit of negative emotions and memories. This state had reminded me of how it felt to be locked in the trunk of a car as a child, trapped with no way out. I knew pharmacology would have to take its course eventually, but I couldn't wait that long. I could already feel a negative afterglow settling in on myself for days to come.<BR>
<BR>
I had been toying around with the idea of taking some Methylone. For me Methylone has had rather good success as a very useful therapeutic tool. Yes, it has some similarities to MDMA but the overall feel of the chemical is quite unique. With MDMA I always feel a running urge to get as most out of the experience as possible before my time is up and I'm shoved back into the crumby world of reality. Methylone gives me none of the urgency or sense of rush. I'm simply content to lay there and enjoy. The funny thing is this lack of urgency stays with me for about a week after taking Methylone. You might even call it an Entactogenic-Antidepressent, which is certainly what I needed at the time. <BR>
<BR>
Heres to science!!!! I got out a capsule and decided to go with the nasal route since I was already high and almost out of methylone. I laid out about 100 mgs by candle light and added some yopo snuff to my so-called chemical antidote to help heal myself. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! That BURNED! My nose throbbing, I lay back on my bed. Soon the world began that strange undulation that only yopo can produce. Yet when I realized this I felt as though my sinuses were melting. I could feel them shifting and moving as if they were burning away. I became quite frightened at the fact of doing some type of permanent damage to myself. I then breathed in and heard a strange pop, much to my surprise I could breath much better than before I snorted the line. <BR>
<BR>
A voice in the back of my head soothed me that if any damage had been done to me by the powder it was purely the results of my own actions and I was ok with this. Under normal circumstances I would be poking and prodding, trying to get to the exact reason why I was ok with it, realize it, and move on. However I simply just let it be, it was what it was and there is no more hope in trying to extract any more reasoning out of it. This growing sense of acceptance is something Methylone has helped me out with a lot, now it's simply up to me to keep it that way. <BR>
<BR>
The guitar was still going strong in the next room. Although now I was somewhat detached and I still couldn't properly focus. Music was called for. My girlfriend kindly brought my disk-man and I put in one of my favorite CD's. The music soothed me with its familiar lyrics and attitude of positivity. Alone with my own inward focus the music brought about some rather profound insights. Unexpected insights as to my immediate plans of work and housing, which over all, boil down to where I want to be in life.<BR>
 <BR>
The negative emotions were still there however. It was as though I was watching them fly about like fireflies caught in a jar. At this point my girlfriend turned on the light and began filling out a job application to Starbucks. I told her my thoughts on the Starbucks job and we both agreed they suck ass although she was still going to take in the application because were poor as dirt right now. I told her my state of mind and all I've been thinking, she understood. We lay there for sometime cuddling. Eventually it evolved into something more, but I wont go into the exact details. <BR>
<BR>
We had both peaked from the 2-cb and I largely down from the Methylone. Let me say that with all the reports regarding the sexual stimulation of 2-cb the both of us thought it almost non existent. Maybe the language of the drug must be learned a bit more before that type of activity can be explored. However, what did unfold was one of the most amazing and heart warming sexual experiences of our lives, not purely physically, but mentally. It was as though our fireflies were being let out of that jar one by one, with all those negative emotions coming out in our sweat and tears. In the end, both of us laying on top of each other in tears so strong it can only be described as a mental orgasm. Although I got around to having a physical orgasm it nearly felt like an act to end our experience. <BR>
<BR>
On a whole I was a little bewildered by this trip. My girlfriend really enjoyed 2-cb and would willingly take it again. For me however, I will proceed with caution and careful attention to atmosphere if I should get the chance. I think I also have a higher tolerance to 2-cb and given a repeat would probably go with about 30 mgs seeing as how most of the time I felt as though my 6'5, 200 pound frame was half in the experience and half out. As for the yopo I didn't get enough to really feel anything beyond the initial rush. As for the Methylone, it put me back on track. I know from previous trip like the first half of this one, with all my inner problems clamoring on the sewer system of my soul I would have a negative afterglow for days or even months. In fact during the trip I was beginning to dread the upcoming weeks appointments, meetings, work, etc. I think Methylone has some real promise as a therapeutic aid and perhaps as a antidepressant which would go by a weekly dose not every three hours. For the most part I'm still not sure what to think of this experience. Perhaps an introduction? But, it was a very interesting and memorable one at that.<!--   End Body   -->

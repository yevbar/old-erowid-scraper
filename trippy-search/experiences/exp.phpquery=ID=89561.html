I normally smoke hash almost every day, but I have no cravings and go by happily without it every now and then. I Used to be a heavy cocaine user, but overcame and have not used it for more than ten years.<br>
<br>
About six months ago I scored some high-grade crystal meth. I had tried meth before and liked it, but hadn’t used it for more than 20 years. My previous use had always been casual, limited. I thought the risks and after-effects outweighed the rewards. This time was different; the meth I got was really strong and pure, with little to none undesirable side effects, and with a very high capacity to cause euphoria and fiendish behavior. Soon I started taking it intravenously, on a weekly pattern of abuse. <br>
<br>
When I realized that things were getting out of hand, I decided to quit. After a month without taking meth, the cravings were constant and intense. I started to look for some kind of replacement, something to fill-in the gap. That’s when I found butylone, along with other legal stimulants ‘not for human consumption’. <br>
<br>
The first time I snorted butylone, I though it felt a little like cocaine on the nose and back of the throat, but without the numbness and with far less euphoria. Soon after I discovered it could be injected, and that 50-100 mg I.V. gave me a mild rush, similar to 10-20 mg regular speed (d-amphetamine), but without many of the bad side effects. Below I try to clarify, in a very objective way, how butylone works for me, and compare it with other common stimulants:<br>
 <br>
Substance: Butylone HCl (purity = 99.7%)<br>
Appearance: Very fine white powder, looks like refined wheat powder<br>
Source: Legal research-chemical laboratory<br>
Price: US$ 35 / gram<br>
Dose: 50 – 150 mg IV or inhaled (snorted) at 1-2 hour intervals, in sessions lasting 12 to 48 hours.<br>
<br>
Effects: <br>
Inhaled: mild stimulation starting after 5-10 minutes. I feel energetic and talkative, more sociable, patient and creative. The effect peaks after 20-25 minutes and a 30-45 minute plateau is followed by a very gentle 20-25 minute comedown. There is almost no sting or burn sensation in the nose and the drip is mild, almost pleasant. I feel like drinking more alcohol (especially very cold beer) and am able to drink much more than usual without feeling drunk or sick. Euphoria is present, but it is very mild. Snorted butylone is for me the closest I ever got to a pure stimulant. Cognitive functions of association, linear thinking, mathematical calculation, logic and memory are not affected or slightly improved. Appetite is diminished but not suppressed, and it is possible to eat almost normally, although it becomes more of a choice than a necessity. There is no urge to redose, and I lose interest spontaneously after consuming three or four lines (150-600 mg). Although it does not affect my interest for sex, it is a great pleasure enhancer; erection is fully achieved and maintained; orgasm is slightly delayed and greatly intensified. Pupils are dilated, heart rate is slightly increased and blood pressure is not affected. Normal sleep is possible 2-3 hours after the last line. Mouth and throat are dry, but not as much as with speed. Very few external signs of intoxication are present, being perfectly possible to deal with people (even close friends and relatives) without anything being noticed at all.<br>
<br>
Injected (I.V.): An intense rush takes place 5-10 seconds after injection, with the same speedy intensity of a smaller dose of methamphetamine, but with much less euphoria. It is hard to stay seated, and a landslide of thoughts and insight invade the brain. This is the only period in which a good observer could possibly notice something. The rush only lasts for 5-10 minutes, followed by a moderate and pleasant high of 30-45 minutes. After an hour or so, there is some urge to redose, which I did many times in a row. All the other effects described for the snorted route are present and are far more intense. Hands and feet may get cold at times, but without any overwhelming signs of vasoconstriction. Tolerance is rapidly built: 50 mg got me a bit jumpy and scared on the first day of my longest run – a 72-hour binge with no sleep and little food – but 150 mg felt very mild at the end. There are no ‘tweaking’ behaviors such as putting appliances apart or organizing clothes in alphabetic order, but I felt tired and disorganized after two sleepless nights. Most importantly, I didn’t think of crystal meth while taking butylone.<br>
<br>
48 hours have passed after my last shot. I have been able to sleep fairly well, but my sleeping pattern is still affected – I am on a sort of chemical jet lag. I feel no cravings for either butylone or meth, but I do consider buying more of the first one after I am fully recovered, which I don’t think will take long. In fact, if not for my twisted sleep cycle, I could say I feel perfectly normal and healthy right now.<br>
<br>
In my experience, butylone is a safe stimulant, with addictive potential much lower than methamphetamine and with some potential for use on meth replacement and rehabilitation.<!--   End Body   -->

I heard about 1,4 while searching for a non prescription sleep aid that did not interfere with the natural stages of sleep. Indirectly I found out that 1,4 was used recreationally and a larger percentage of it activates the natural production of GHB in the body. <BR>
<BR>
Never having tried GHB, and hearing 1,4 was very similar i decided to purchase some. It ended up being very cheap - $70 for 1 pint ( somewhere around 450 ml ). <BR>
<BR>
My plan was to use the readily availible & cheap 1,4 as a relaxing agent to take in conjunction with psychedelics during the come down or during a bad trip. I have heard of many other people doing this with good results.<BR>
<BR>
I couldn't find much about the dosages on the internet except from reading personal reports on the psychedelics newsgroup. What I found out was that a normal recreational dose for 1 person could mean coma for another. I determined that a good starting dose to gauge how sensitive you are to it was 1-2 ml of pure, undiluted 1,4. <BR>
<BR>
So one night at about 10pm, 2 of my friends ( J & D ) and I decided to test the waters of 1,4. I went out and bought a liquid measuring syringe (can be found at any grocery store near the pharmacy or baby products aisle). This allowed me to accurately measure single ml doses. I measured out 2.5 ml for myself, and 2 ml for my other 2 friends. We dosed up at about 10:30 pm.  I put mine in a little shot glass mixed with soda. It didn't taste that bad, a little thick like cough syrup but much better than vodka. About 20 minutes passed and we all started feeling affected. <BR>
<BR>
The first effects we felt were slightly impaired motor coordination & relaxation. J was feeling about twice as effected as we were. I forgot to mention earlier that i took it after a full meal. D & I decided to take 2 more ml at about 11:50.<BR>
<BR>
The relaxation feeling and impaired coordination grew, also a euphoria started to come about,  but we wanted more so  D & I decided to take 2 more ml at about 1 am . J decided to take 2 more ml totalling to 4ml for the night. After about 30 minutes passed D & I were both feeling very messed up. Bodily we were drunk, but mentally I was experiencing a clear mind, I wasnt mentally intoxicated or stupid like on alcohol. My friend D was experiencing mental impairment, but not as much as he would on alcohol. He said if he wanted to he could go to sleep instantly by laying down and closing his eyes. I did not feel that tired. It wasnt as good as a sleep aid as i'd heard from various peoples. 1 50mg Diphenhydramine hcl ( dramamine ) deemed to be a much better sleep aid for me. Now I was on 6ml of 1,4.<BR>
<BR>
At about 2:00 am D fell asleep on his bed. J & I watched tv while enjoying the intoxicating, very enoyable euphoric and rexlaxing effects of 1,4. J was experiencing slight nausea. At about 2:30 am D ran to the bathroom. He threw up around 4 times. He then asked me to watch him to make sure he didn't throw up while passed out. He fell asleep again. I watched him for a couple hours to make sure he was okay. The effects started wearing off at this point for me so I decided to take 2 more ml of 1,4 at 3:00 am. After waiting about 30 minutes I didn't really notice an increase in the effects. I decided to go to sleep. I experienced a very restless and uncomfortable sleep and woke up at 1pm still feeling tired. From what i've read this is unusual for 1,4. Most people who take 1,4 for sleeping say it has no lasting effects in the morning and produces an extremely restful sleep. <BR>
<BR>
From this experience i have learned the following - 1,4 does not work for me as a sleep aid. 1,4 is one of the most fun, cheapest, convenient social drugs I've done so far. Mixing it with a psychedelic during the comedown would eaze the tension and restlessness but not as much as a benzo ( valium, xanax ) or a lot of other relaxing sleep inducing drugs.<BR>
<BR>
Make sure you measure out your doses correctly. Don't do an untested high dose alone, its very possible to pass out and choke on your own vomit. Start out at 1ml to be extra careful. Do not jump into a high dose. The effects seemed to last a total of 2 hours. I thing I didn't notice was the emotional or music enhancement people claim to get that is similar to MDMA. I hear people calling GHB liquid E. I do not see very many similarities between the two.<!--   End Body   -->

One Summers night out of work, me and my girlfriend got in a car with this couple we knew and headed out for a weekend camping.<BR>
<BR>
Sitting silent on the back seat staring out the window, looking for reassurance in the passing scenery, individually contemplating the journey ahead.<BR>
<BR>
My anxiety was natural, it was the product of an unnatural life. Seperated from myself just after birth, I'd ended up working in a mindless, faceless corporate sweat shop, processing processes. I wanted, needed,  a reunion, my only misgivings were wether what I had planned was going to aggrevate the schism.<BR>
<BR>
We arrived at seven, pitched our tents, ate dinner.<BR>
<BR>
An hour later I took one pill.<BR>
<BR>
We went down by the riverside, sat down on cooling earth, the smell of chlorophyll and sweat, like when I was a kid.<BR>
<BR>
Within 20 minutes I was feeling the beginnings.After 30 I was siezed by panic and it was evident from my sweating and cracked grin that I was struggling. Thankfully my friends left me alone.<BR>
<BR>
Whilst they carried on their conversations I sat trying to come to terms with my condition, all I could do was stare out over the river. Slowly, over a few minutes my heart rate dropped, my sweat dried,cooling my skin. Staring at the river, the reflections, the persistent gentle flow, the greatest calmness I have ever felt descended on me,like all sense away from man revealed an endless coming into being. <BR>
<BR>
(I spent the rest of the evening with my girlfriend).<BR>
<BR>
I get angry at the unthinking, knee jerk, demonising critics of MDMA who seem unconcerned at the truly demonic aspects of a ruanway society with it's excessive demands, it's lonliness, it's greed, where we are all mentally ill, in an acceptable way. I suggest that this is a neccessary tool to combat the mental hardship inflicted on us by the unreasonable demands of a society which we can not control and which is, in fact, controlling us with threats.<!--   End Body   -->

There seems to be quite a bit of interest regarding the combination of SSRIs with psychedelics.  I took zoloft daily for about a month and sometime during the middle of that month I tripped with some friends off an eigth of P.cubensis mushrooms on the beach in Del Mar.  We are all experienced trippers and it is my belief that if the right precaustions are taking when using mushrooms or any psychedelic they can be used for healing processes.<BR>
<BR>
The mushrooms were great quality.  Grown by a local hippie I know in San Diego.  At about twenty minutes after ingestion we all started to get giggly and we headed down the street from my friends house to the beach.  As we walked down the beach to find a good place to set up camp I was tripping (about T+25 min).  The white sand cliffs that lined the beach looked like giant silver sirens coaxing me along my way down the shore.  We found a spot and most of my friends ran to the ocean and started swimming in the waves (this was around 9 or 10 pm too, lol).  I was pretty much curled up into the fetal position on the sand with the most amazing body high I have ever experienced (a different type of body high from ecstacy but very intense).  My body felt so good it honostly felt like I had a two hour orgasm and for some reason I was seeing very erotic visuals.  Closed eyes especially, but even when I opened my eyes I would see figures in the clouds like a movie was being projected up to the sky.  Even before I took SSRIs I would get a very intense body high on the come up, such that I usually have to be sitting or laying down while I come up.  Open eyed visuals were such that white lights appeared to have a prism effect around their edges.  I could cleary see the ROYGBV rainbow which to me is an interesting phonemena because these different colors simply represent different energies of electromagnetic radiation.  <BR>
<BR>
I started wondering what effect the chemical could be having on my brain that allowed it to perceive white light as a separation of the specta that is represents.  Patterns were the dominant open eyed visual as colors didnt seem  as spectacular as I remember them being on shrooms.  My friends faces had crazy lines all of them and when I went to piss on the edge of a sandy dune everything started to distort and swirl.  I had just seen the movie, I heart Huckabees, which asks a lot of questions about metaphysics which I find very interesting, especially with conscious altering substances.  I swear I could create my own reality and even make things in my visual field move from one place to another even though they were totally inanimate.  These thoughts resulted in a very positive trip.  <BR>
<BR>
At one point I looked up and could see the ocean breeze moving out towards the ocean.  I could actually visualize the convection currents of the wind moving because there was condensation in the air that allowed me to see every movement of the wind.  It was amazing and I wondered if I could ever see that if I were not on mushrooms.  I think the mushrooms gave me the sensory perception to see things that have always been there, but I simply cannot see in my uninebriated state.  The trip was quite intense, but short lived.  At about T-4 hrs I had returned to my old functioning self.  We all went back to my friends house and smoked some reefer and I would space out get some strange visuals looking the carpet or wallpaper.  I'm not sure if the SSRI caused the trip to be short and intense or if it was just the mushrooms we got.  <BR>
<BR>
The most important thing that I will say about using an SSRI with mushrooms is that it made it a lot harder to have a bad trip.  Everything seemed perfect this time.  Usually with shrooms I can get disoriented and paranoid or scared, but this trip is probably my favorite of the 7 or 8 times I have tripped.<!--   End Body   -->

For the longest time I tried to score some good quality cocaine as I've heard so many good stories of it from a lot of people.  I read quite a bit on it how it stimulates the pleasure centers of the brain and I wanted to experiment with that.  Finally, after some time I found myself a solid connection for a decent price and good quality.<br>
<br>
The first time I did it, it was around a gram done in a span of 3 hours.  I broke it up and there must've been around 10 good lines or more, don't really remember.  I was expecting euphoria but instead I got a numb tongue, mouth, nose and throat.  No euphoria.  I was totally disappointed and thought it might be some junk coke.  Three other people have tried it and got totally messed up off it so I know it's good.<br>
<br>
Two weeks later, I got myself another 1.5 grams and did that in a span of around 6 hours.  Afterwards, I would eat something and go to sleep without much effort.  I do have a low tolerance for most drugs; couple vicodins knocks me out into extreme euphoria, 5 or 6 puffs of mary jane gets me high for 3 hours and if I had not had a cigarette for a few days, the first few puffs give me a buzz.  I guess for some people, cocaine doesn't work as advertised.  I wouldn't turn it down if offered as the numbing sensations and the act of breaking it down and sniffing it up is fun but to get addicted to it, no way.  I went through some severe addictions and know what they're like.  Coke, to me, seems like a waste of money.  I'll stick to opiates.<!--   End Body   -->

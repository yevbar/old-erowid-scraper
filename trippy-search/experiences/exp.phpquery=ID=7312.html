I had found a very large bottle of Hydrocodone/APAP (Acetaminophen) pills in my parents' medicine cabinet and decided to grab a few to see what they did.  Before I tried them, I gave 3 to my friend who took them and told me that it had been a very enjoyable experience that was almost like an LSD trip.  So today I decided to try them, taking 3 as well.  <BR>
	<BR>
I took them at about 11:45 and started feeling the effects 20 or so minutes later.  It felt just like a codeine high at that point but I knew it would get quite a bit more intense.  At that point me and 2 friends, J and L, decided to leave campus and walk to a nearby park (we were in school).  On the way there about 10 minutes later, the effects were still coming up, and becoming more surreal.  We were walking up a hill and I had the feeling that we were climbing a very steep mountain and that we would never get to the top. My legs got tired and I had to rest once (even though it was quite a gentle slope), and when we got to the park at about 12:35 the effects had gotten pretty intense.  <BR>
	<BR>
The three of us smoked one bowl of some fairly strong weed, then hung out in the park with 2 other friends we had found there.  At that point it was definitely more than a normal codeine high.  I kept claiming I was different animals and kept mistaking normal objects for other things (for example I thought this tree was a 'cow with a big horn that starts out small then gets all big' etc).  I had a nice body feel, but my skin was all cold and clammy, and my arms were pretty numb.  <BR>
	<BR>
We walked back to school and by the time we got there, both the weed and the hydrocodone had reached thier plateaus, and it was a fairly heavy trip.  On the way back, we were of course walking downhill, but I was convinced that we were still walking uphill which was very confusing because we walked uphill to get there.  <BR>
	<BR>
When we got back was when the most interesting part of the experience happened.  I started just rattling off poetry, it just kept flowing from me for about half an hour.  A couple of the friends I was with are very good poets, and they said that the stuff I was saying was some of the best poetry they had ever heard (even though I have always sucked at writing poetry).  I wish someone had been able to write what I was saying down, but no one had a pencil and paper.  I just kept talking in poetry for quite a while, and after a while I realized that I wasnt even able to talk in anything but rhymes and poetry, it was quite wierd.  Everything I was talking about was very surreal too, I wish I could remember some.  <BR>
	<BR>
The effects lasted until about 5:00.  Overall it was a very very enjoyable trip, something I would definitely want to do again, but this time have a taperecorder with me.  Someone told me my voice was very different, calmer, smoother and mellower.  The one bad part of it was that at one point about halfway through, I suddenly totally flipped out on someone for like nothing at all, I was yelling and kicking over trash cans and stuff.  After I calmed down, for about 10 minutes, I had this horrible wave of depression and sadness and I almost cried for no reason at all but after that I was fine.<!--   End Body   -->

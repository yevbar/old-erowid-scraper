This past Saturday I had my best trip to date. It was an Indian summer on this Saturday in December, it was 60 degrees and sunny when it would usually be in the 40's. My best friend C and I would be taking 1 blotter each once we woke up. I put the hit on my tongue at 7:20 and C dosed about 15 minutes later. The anxious buzz that I experienced on mushrooms and my first LSD trip was present after 30 minutes. I listened to Ariel Pink as I waited for the effects to kick in. Generally, when I trip, I get a restless feeling and cannot sit still, and this soon started to kick in.<br>
<br>
I headed upstairs to hang out with C who was starting on his trip project, which was to paint his bedroom. I soon began to think of everything I wanted to do and experience while I was tripping so I could get the most out of this rare psychedelic. I got dressed to go outside and put on the most colorful clothes that I owned. I put my big padded headphones on, started 'The Six Parts Seven - Silence Magnifies Sound' and headed out the front door.<br>
<br>
Everything was bright and beaming from the unrestricted sun. The day was absolutely beautiful. I started to feel extremely excited and I couldn't hold back the smile on my face. I walked throughout our big yard and ended up in the backyard. I stood at the end of this big opening in our backyard and looked out over the grass, which was partly green and tall and also brown, short, and dying. This is when I noticed the first apparent visuals. The grass was swaying, dancing, and moving side to side. Everything was alive and dancing in front of me. I got the effect of everything being underwater and swaying. The sun was shining in my left eye as I gazed out over this amazing landscape. The Six Parts Seven album I was listening put me in the perfect mood, the ambient-melodic instrumental music was the perfect soundtrack. It was incredible, a word I would use A LOT during this trip.<br>
<br>
I pulled a big wooden chair to the back of the yard and sat down to soak in everything on this beautiful Indian summer. After about 10 minutes I returned inside to tell C that he HAD to go outside and experience all these wonderful things. C was busy and focused on painting his room. He was certainly enjoying every bit of this experience like I was. He was singing at the top of his lungs and was beaming with happiness. When I told him to go outside and check things out he said that he had been going outside to wash brushes and such and was very aware of the wonder outside. I then looked out his window and saw the tall tree that held our tree platform. It was glowing in the sunlight and looked amazing! I was so stunned that I had to go out and climb it.<br>
<br>
I headed downstairs and got sidetracked. I felt like I should eat something so I could keep up the energy that the LSD required. I made a TLT sandwhich (Tofu, Lettuce, Tomato) and ate half while sitting at the dining room table, looking out the window. C would be passing by, busy as a bee, going here and there to finish little tasks. I left my sandwhich and headed to the tree in the backyard. I began to climb the tree, which I was very familiar with since I had climbed it so many times before. When I got half way up I looked out of this clearing where there are no branches to obstruct my vision. I felt like I was on the side of a HUGE tree looking down 50 ft., when I was really only about 20 ft. in the air. I climbed the rest of the way up, laughing and smiling, I was having the best time possible.<br>
<br>
Sitting on the platform in the tree, I was within talking distance of C's bedroom window, where we relayed how awesome we were feeling, and how great of a time we were having. By this time it was about 10am and we were still coming up. I saw my other roommate driving down the road on his way home, so I climbed down the tree to tell him about what I was experiencing. He came inside and I asked him if he would want to play some music with me. He was down for playing guitar, so I sat at the drums. Up until this point I never really considered myself able when it came to the drums, but as he started playing some ambient-psych rock, I just started playing. The drum head on the snare drum had a swirling pattern on it, which I just stared at as I got into the rhythm of playing the drums. The hi-hat cymbal had the rings running around it and they were all bending and twisting. The letter etching on the cymbals were all being distorted, it was almost making me loose focus on playing the drums. After our ears started ringing, we stopped, R had work to do around the house. I got up from the drums and went to finish my sandwhich.<br>
<br>
I went upstairs to hang out with C and R since their rooms are very close to each other. When I got upstairs they were both partaking in a pipe of some mids that C had. I was weary about smoking since I had gotten paranoia from smoking while on shrooms before. They explained that it calmed them down a bit and that once it wore off it was back to the full boosters of the LSD. I obliged and they told me to smoke it in the closet so I could see some patterns that only showed in the dark, also that is where my cat was hiding out. I entered the walk-in closet and took some hits and I started to feel like I was peaking more. I enjoyed the grass and walked out to go draw while listening to The Beatles - White Album and Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band.<br>
<br>
I had previously bought a large sketchpad after my last LSD trip, where I felt like I was unprepared in the art dept. I had also found some pastels that I had never used before. I began drawing with some paint pens while I was sitting on the couch in R's room. I had never really gotten into the Beatles before, but listening to Rocky Raccoon made me appreciate them for the first time, it was really incredible the feelings I got. C was in his doorway painting away and I was sitting on the couch a few feet away in R's room hysterically laughing and smiling. We both couldn’t contain all the joy that was in us. C then exclaimed 'I FEEL LIKE I’M FULL OF FUCKIN' JOY!' I knew exactly how he was feeling and I had to agree. We were both beaming and feeling awesome. I was laughing so hard that I couldn’t focus on what I was drawing. I finally gave up on using paint pens and moved onto some charcoal pieces that I had never used before this day. I did some exaggerated drawings of faces and used some brightly colored pastels. It was so satisfying drawing and using this new medium.<br>
<br>
After a while of drawing, we hit the homemade vaporizer and got ready to canoe to a state Park that was close by. While getting ready I put on some sunglasses and looked out the back door at the sky. The clouds were swirling and making these really intense patterns. They were moving frantically and were twisting and swirling. I was so fascinated by the sky that I stood motionless at the backdoor for 5 minutes or so, marvelling at the sky. C and I headed out the door to go canoing over to Seashore State Park once we gathered all the things we would need. While we were heading down our street with the canoe on our cart, there was A FUCKING FIRETRUCK IN THE ROAD. The lights were blinking in random patterns and it was incredibly shiny and just blew me away. We walked right by it and were within a foot of it, and I got to look at all the controls on the side and everything. C and I were both laughing and were excited that we had this rare opportunity. The firetruck was idling and sounded like a big cat purring.<br>
<br>
We looked at all the trees and everything looked different, yet the same. The trees were so vibrant and detailed. Colors were bold and the weather was beautiful. Soon we reached the boat launch and we were off. At this time we were about 4 hours or more into the trip, but past what I would consider the peak, which happened while I was listening to The Beatles and was drawing in R's room. The water immediately caught my attention and it looked like wine in a green bottle. Even though I have been canoing in that bay many times before, this felt like it was entirely new. C and I began to talk about the role of the individual in the world, and about how we felt like little organisms on this big creature called Earth. Maybe we were supposed to be helping out the Earth, in the same way that white blood cells help our human body, so that the Earth remained a thriving place for all life. I began to feel like I was part of this big system, and it felt incredible.<br>
<br>
After canoing along for a while we reached the end of the park, docked the canoe, and headed to this secluded meadow. We climbed a tree and shared a pipe of grass. This would mark the farthest reach of our trip and from then on would be our return home. The stillness and quietness that I experienced was relaxing and just what I needed.<!--   End Body   -->

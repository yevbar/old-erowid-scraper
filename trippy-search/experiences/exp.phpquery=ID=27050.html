I recieved my supply of Kratom today in the form of crushed, nearly powdered leaves.  this was disappointing considering the current situation with false Kratom permeating the market.  i had hoped to be able to confirm the identity of the substance despite the level of trust felt for the supplier that i had used.  <BR>
<BR>
From what i could figure, considering the limited information i could find on the substance, 650mg of the crushed plant material was about equal to two medium sized fresh leaves at .43% mitragynine content. At 1:10 pm i began to chew on the .65g, i kept it in my mouth for about 5 minutes slowly chewing before i finally swallowed.  It tasted like generic dried plant material (if that standard exists) and had bitter undertones.  I noticed that it made parts of my mouth a little numb for about 10 minutes. <BR>
Being a bit impatient and starting to lose faith in this plant's potential, i ate another .4g at 1:35, 25 minutes later.  I felt little or no activity over the next 25 minutes and so I decided to pack a very small amount of marijuana in a bowl and fill the rest with more kratom, probably about .07g - .1g and smoke it. <BR>
 <BR>
Very shortly after I began to feel lazy.  This progressed to a very pleasant sedation, i was severely calm and kind of tired.  My mind was still functional and so i walked to a friends house on my way to my 3:00 class.  Socializing was fine, i felt as though my soft voice tone and sluggish movements brought my vibe to my friends at the house.  i felt the muscles around my eyes softened and my lids a little heavy, the last thing i wanted to do was go to class.  But I, of little foresight, didnt give myself the choice and slumped my head in my hands for an hour and a half during my extremely bland U.S. civ. class. The pleasantness waned due to the setting and i laughed to myself thinking about the articles that i read suggesting that kratom gives it's traditional taiwanese users the urge to work and helps them through the day.  The discrepency in those effects reported and my experience could be caused by dose, but from the inside of my experience the notion of wanting to work seemed ridiculous, reaching for a remote was a chore.  It's 5:45 now and the sedative effects are on thier way out, just in time for my 6:00 class.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, It is definately an active substance but almost like an anti-histamine in that it seems like a simple and empty drowsyness more than anything else. I had a mild euphoria and it was fun i suppose. I will repeat the experiment a few more times but so far no insight or particularly interesting qualities and no high hope for any in the future.     p.s. take it AFTER class.<!--   End Body   -->

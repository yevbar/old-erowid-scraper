After trying a variety of medications prescribed and non-prescribed; most being quite unpleasant and usually not very effective, I went back to sceletium which previously I had noticed barely any effects from at all. <br>
<br>
For the first few days I swallowed two 50mg pills and was distressed because of the lack of effects but for some reason was sure there was potential in this plant. The change happened when I decided to hold the contents of the pills inside my mouth for 30 minutes or so instead of just swallowing. Within 30-60 minutes I began feeling a lot of commotion in my brain, strange, not extremely unpleasant though. I felt as if my brain was being restructured and rewired. About 4 hours later I felt calm and slightly euphoric but was unsure if this was the exercise I had done or if it was the pills.<br>
<br>
Next day I took 100mg sublingually again to see what happens. I noticed the effects coming on just before I swallowed; my brain being reinforced furthermore, I felt peaceful, happy and connected with my peers; able to just sit outside for hours thinking about the world. This stuff works very well.<br>
<br>
Sceletium changed my life in that it has enabled me to actually feel at ease and content with things instead of the near constant dysphoria before. Now each morning I take 100mg of Sceletium Tortuosm. The effects have become permanent which always amazes me. What conventional SSRIs take 2 weeks to do and with less effectiveness and a variety of unwanted side effects, sceletium did in a few days.<!--   End Body   -->

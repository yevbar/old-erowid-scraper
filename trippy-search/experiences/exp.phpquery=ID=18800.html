After reading so much information about the liquer known as 'Absinthe', I became very curious about its main herbal constituent, wormwood. I ordered a large 1/2 lb. bag of dried wormwood foliage and a one ounce bottle of wormwood extract from an online vendor. Here are some of my experiences with the substance.<BR>
<BR>
First, I tried smoking the dried foliage (roughly 1/3 gram). I did this alone on a quiet evening. There were no other drugs or alcohol consumed for my first experiment, and I was in a tranquil state of mind. I dimmed down the lights and relaxed, and then packed a bowl of the wormwood into a small ceramic pipe. I drew in a small hit. The first thing I noticed was the taste...very much like dried hay, but not terribly harsh on the lungs. After finishing the bowl, I just sat back and relaxed for a bit, hoping to feel some effects. There was a slight calming of my mood, but that was about all I noticed. I must say that I was somewhat disappointed with my first experiment.<BR>
<BR>
The second experiment was similar to the first. It was just a few nights later with a similar mind set. The difference is that I smoked much more of the substance, this time in cigarette form. It was probably at least a gram of material. Once again, I felt very little effect from smoking the wormwood. I even consumed a couple of beers afterward to see if this would enhance the effects, but there was no noticable difference. I concluded that smoking wormwood was really not worth the effort, since the taste is not particularly pleasant and the effects almost too mild to notice.<BR>
<BR>
The third experiment again involved the dried wormwood foliage. This time, I decided to try the herb in a tea form. I had read that this was a popular way to consume wormwood. I again chose a quiet evening alone to brew my tea. Since my smoking efforts had been so disappointing, I figured that a much larger amount of herb was needed to achieve any psychoactive effects. I placed roughly 15 grams of wormwood into a perculator, and brewed the tea for about 10 minutes. After the tea had cooled, I poured some into a mug and tasted it...HORRIBLE!!! I found it to be extremely bitter and unpleasant to drink. Even with this setback, I managed to eventually consume the entire batch of tea (it took about 45 minutes). Unfortunately, my perseverence did not pay off...I still found the effects to be negatable.<BR>
<BR>
By this time, I had become frustrated with the wormwood foliage and shelved it for a while. Even though it seemed to have a mild calming effect, it hardly seemed worth the effort of smoking the herb or drinking it in a tea. I still had the bottle of extract, but was not certain how to make use of it. The final experiment happened a couple of months later, when a friend was visiting from out of town. My friend is a heavy drinker, and has a particular fondness of vodka. While we were reading about Absinthe online, an idea came to mind...why not pour the wormwood extract into a glass of vodka? <BR>
<BR>
We realized that this was not the same as 'Absinthe', that is why I have submitted this report to the wormwood vault. We were hoping that we could at least get a 'sense' of what the real Absinthe would be like. Late in the evening, we each poured ourselves a stiff Vox on the rocks (we only drink high quality vodka). We then put about 3 dropperfuls of wormwood extract into each drink, turning the vodka dark green. I had predicted that the flavor would be awful, but was surprised that it was not as bad as the tea I had brewed previously. This is not to say that it tasted good...we had regrets about using such expensive vodka for this experiment. <BR>
<BR>
It was after a couple of these 'cocktails' that I began to get quite buzzed. I believe it was mainly from the alcohol, but I did notice a slight difference...it seemed as though I was more stimulated than usual. I was a little more talkative and jovial than I usually get when drinking. After a third 'wormwood cocktail', I started to get a bit tipsy. I felt a warmth in my body that is not typical of three drinks. I cannot say that there was anything 'psychedelic' about this state, but it was not a normal drunkeness. <BR>
<BR>
All this time, I kept asking my friend is he had any effects. He did not seem to be getting the effects as profoundly as I was, though he was enjoying himself. We ended up using the enitire bottle of extract. The next morning, I awoke with the worst hangover that I can remember having in many years. I was dehydrated, and my head felt as though it was clamped in a vice. It seemed a bit odd, since I normally do not get hangovers when I drink. It took me the entire day to recover. <BR>
<BR>
Here is my conclusion based on my experiences with wormwood: It is simply not worth it to me. I have tried about every method of consumption possible, and have found the results not worth the efforts. I am glad that I experimented with this herb, however, and would love to try real Absinthe some day.<!--   End Body   -->

I would like to relay to you all the experience I had last night with morning glory seeds. During the day I purchased a beautiful pepper grinder and 9 1.5gram packs of Burpee heavenly blue morning glory seeds. I got home, cleaned the grinder, washed the seeds, and began grinding. <BR>
<BR>
1 hour and 15 minutes later I was finished - what a tedious chore. I now had sitting in front of me a large plastic cup with a fine powder of morning glory at the bottom - 13.5 grams to be exact. <BR>
<BR>
I poured 8 ounces of distilled water over the seeds and covered the cup with plastic wrap. I then set the cup in the refridgerater - making sure to shake every 15 minutes. <BR>
<BR>
2 hours and 15 minutes later I strained the liquid and discarded the seed pulp. Bottums up. <BR>
<BR>
I quickly downed my brew, it didn't taste nearly as bad as I had expected. I drank a glass of orange juice to wash it down. <BR>
<BR>
I began to feel light headed and very 'full' after 15 minutes. I began getting tingles. These tingles advanced to what I would call 'hella tingles.' Shapes started to morph and shadows shook - as when you have a candle lit. I saw a tree in the middle of my living room and it disappeared after some strange animal jumped out of it. At this point I was quite apprehensive, for I was starting to trip hard and it was only 30 minutes into the trip. <BR>
<BR>
I was nauseous and getting cold flashes so I turned up the heat and went into my room to listen to music and lay in my bed. After some time of arranging the light content of my room to a comfortable level I laid down and tried to avoid throwing up. <BR>
<BR>
I was getting out of bed and going to the bathroom to urinate literally every 10 minutes - laying in bed wasn't working, I was still cold and had to get up to often to piss. I thus came up with the idea to lay in the bathtub. <BR>
<BR>
I was very proud of myself for choosing the bathtub and felt almost as though I had discovered something wonderful. In the bathtub I was able to control my temperature easily, urinate without having to move and throw up - if the need arose - without ruining clothes and sheets. <BR>
<BR>
The water felt magical on my body and at times it felt like the droplets of water running down my back were cold fingers. The nausea was gone and I was in a state of tranquility. I found my thoughts were dancing around my head - not racing, but dancing. <BR>
<BR>
After some time of contemplating life and reality in the tub I came to the following conclusions: <BR>
<BR>
1. I can sleep on my head<BR>
2. I am cat<BR>
3. I am a big ball of dirt<BR>
4. I am a water molecule floating about without a care in the world <BR>
<BR>
I got out of the tub and went back on the computer where I entered T3P IRC chat. The insanity was obvious. Everyone was everyone else yet all one. People were speaking of hilarious yet mind blowing things. <BR>
<BR>
Here are some of the things I said in #dxm last night ( thank god for logs ): <BR>
<BR>
[02:35] the dentists are rosebushing christianity<BR>
[02:35] lol<BR>
[02:35] you are fun<BR>
[02:35] people<BR>
[02:35] of earth <BR>
<BR>
[02:36] you are all one big mutant murple being the color of fun man <BR>
<BR>
[02:40] i turned into a water molecule and went into the ocean<BR>
[02:40] then turned into a phish fishing for balls of dirt <BR>
<BR>
[02:42] i am a cattitucas monkeiest ballio dirtobal <BR>
<BR>
[02:44] you cant trip on jaguars<BR>
[02:44] the car maybe<BR>
[02:44] but not cats <BR>
<BR>
[02:52] jesus rises again. to the beat of viagra<BR>
[02:52] and loves all the children <BR>
<BR>
[03:11] same here koma<BR>
[03:11] but my balls are being fucked by mimes <BR>
<BR>
At this point I left the channel and went to IHOP. There was a football team there preparing for the superbowl, I think they were the Baltimore Ravens. I tried to eat but got very nauseous and almost vomited. I went home and went to bed. I went to sleep at 5 am. <BR>
<BR>
Overall I learned that morning glories are a tool. It is obvious why Native American cultures used them - they can be fun, but only after you learned the lesson they were meant to teach.<!--   End Body   -->

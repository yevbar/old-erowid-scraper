00:00 - Two large serving spoons, roughly 20ml. <br>
<br>
00:30 - After about a half hour or so I felt my innards go numb. I was hoping for a euphoric state, but did not feel one.<br>
<br>
01:00 - I took a swig, drinking roughly about 15ml because I was not satisfied with the effects. I noticed a strange sensation in my nerves, however. It seemed that I was easily startled. My nerves would jolt at unexpected noises or movements.<br>
<br>
01:30 - Still not satisfied with the effects, I took another 15ml swig.<br>
<br>
02:00 - Still I felt nothing short of sleepiness and inner numbness. There was also mild head high, and I was still easily startled.<br>
<br>
02:30 - I was really sleepy, so I decided to lay in my bed. I dozed off almost instantly.<br>
<br>
08:30 - My mom wakes me up for dinner. I eat then go back to bed.<br>
<br>
11:30 - I wake up because my girlfriend calls. I feel very irritable. I get in an argument with her over something meaningless. After talking with her I decide to do my homework. I do it and go back to bed.<br>
<br>
The next day was awful. I had terrible anxiety all day. I freaked out about meaningless things, and continued the pointless argument with my girlfriend. I was also still being easily startled by everything. I jumped in the morning when I took a drink and the water touched my lips. I jumped when my neighbor touched my shoulder in English class. Any physical contact with anything seemed to cause my nerves to jolt. I was starting to worry if I had permanently damaged myself. I hoped it would wear off with sleep. The day after the anxiety ended, but I still felt the effects on my nerves, however they were much milder. I didn't jump at every instance of physical contact. But still, I jumped at unexpected contact. The third day it finally went away. <br>
<br>
In all the experience wasn't enjoyable. It wasn't terrifying tough either. I'd probably never do it again, simply because it didn't really produce any favorable effects. Hydrocodone cough syrup is a million times better.<!--   End Body   -->

Setting: My darkened NYC apartment on a cold winter night.  No music.  Wife (an experienced voyager) present as sitter, along with sleeping dog. <BR>
<BR>
Set: I had not consumed any other psychoactive substances since a heroic dose of home-cultivated psylocibe cubensis three weeks prior.  I was feeling rather listless, and I was very excited to try this plant, despite several friends' failure to have a breakthrough experience with Salvia over a  period of several weeks.<BR>
<BR>
Dosage: 100mg (accurately weighed), smoked in a water pipe.<BR>
<BR>
Experience: Loaded the bowl with 50 mg, and placed the other half of the dose in a folded rolling paper beside the pipe.  With sweaty palms I fired the bowl until the leaves glowed cherry red, filled the chamber and took in all the smoke (which was quite pleasant, actually).  While holding in the smoke I reloaded the bowl, then exhaled and repeated the process.  I recall glancing up at my curious-looking wife, then opening my mouth to exhale and tell her about the curious taste and the beginnings of a prickly, heavyweight body load, then...<BR>
<BR>
Liftoff.  There was virtually no transition: the room broke up rapidly into hard-edged, earth-toned (green and yellow) patterns, and my conscious ego was instantly erased.  I had no idea whether my eyes were open or closed, and I had absolutely no recollection that I had, just seconds before, smoked something.  In fact, there was no sense of self whatsoever; rather, I felt as if my body had atomized (this was, I think, due to the initial prickly body load, as if my molecules were merging into those of the sofa) and I was part of the swirling mass of universal matter.  Plainly put, I felt like I had died, and it was the most exquisite terror I have ever experienced.  I was strongly aware of an Other, an ambivalent observer who was, I felt, chastising me for what I later realized was disingenuous motivation: the desire for a thrill.  The Other was a kind of cosmic trickster, who seemed to be saying: 'You want to know what this is?  I'll show you, and I don't think you're ready..!<BR>
.' I cannot think of any analagous experience, drug-induced or otherwise.  The feeling was almost unbearably intense, and I felt utterly alone, merged with a kind of universal energy stream beyond our earthly dimension, a kind of agnostic reincarnation detached from any religious significance.<BR>
<BR>
This phase lasted about 90 seconds, according to my wife (my head was lolling on the sofa, eyes were open but unfocused). Over the next 2 minutes or so, my ego began its self-defensive reconstruction, and I was gripped by an incredible existential horror: I began to remember that I had once been someone, a being with physical form from a wonderful place, and I desperately wanted to get back to that place.  The room began to reappear, but in pieces; at this point I stood up and began to stumble around the living room, trying to find my way back.  It was all a big joke, this reality thing - I knew that it was all illusion, a shabby movie set of our collective devising.  I saw my wife but didn't recognize her...I just wanted to be back.  <BR>
<BR>
When I returned I was standing in the bathroom doorway, grabbing the doorframe and sweating profusely.  I stripped off all my clothes and paced about the room.  My wife was fairly horrified, and I began giggling and saying 'Oh my god  oh my god oh my god...' like a madman.  At T +15 minutes I was more or less 'normalized', but still perspiring heavily.  Vision slightly blurred until T +40, at which point I was able to recount the whole experience to my wife.  Slept incredibly well that night, with unusually vivid, pastoral dreams.<BR>
<BR>
Observations: Salvia is an almost unbearably powerful teacher plant.  I can say without exaggeration that it seriously altered my worldview, and I am now, two months later, still pondering the signifance of my encounter.  I am not a recreational drug user, but I think that my cavalier attitude towards the salvia experience resulted in a trip that was perhaps more intense than it might have been had I approached things with a more respectful attitude.  Also, I'd been reading a lot of pop science (James Gleick's 'Chaos' and Brian Greene's 'The Elegant Universe'), which I think tinged the experience with a distinct materialist/agnostic feeling, although I certainly can't explain the presence of the Other/Overmind.  It was neither good nor evil, but rather profoundly ambivalent.  I have since begun a reassessment of my thoughts regarding religious experience and the afterlife.  <BR>
<BR>
Recommendations:  A respectful attitude is essential, as is a sitter: I could have very easily stumbled out of my apartment and into the street while trying to 'find my way back'.  Prior psychedelic/entheogenic experience strongly advised.<!--   End Body   -->

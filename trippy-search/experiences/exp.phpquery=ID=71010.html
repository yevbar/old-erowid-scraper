This report is based loosely on a shorter, stream of consciousness reflection I wrote the day after the experience, using some notes I took at the time of the experience.  The remaining information is based on my recollection. <br>
 <br>
Substance: ~23 mg of white, crystalline powder in a clear gel capsule, sold as 4-AcO-MIPT and weighed out from a plastic bag with a white label typical of research chemicals bought over the internet<br>
 <br>
Date: February 10th, 2007<br>
 <br>
Set: I was excited at the idea of trying a rare psychedelic research chemical.  I’d already tried some more common research psychedelics (2C-B and 2C-E) and was looking forward to my first tryptamine experience since October (5-MeO-DMT).  I tried 2C-E a few weeks earlier and felt mostly back to a normal mindset, although cannabis continued to bring back subtle residual effects of the phenethylamine.  I had my first major feeling of depression over the previous Christmas break, during which time I smoked quality bud almost every day — the first period of extended heavy smoking in my life.  Cutting back on pot and my positive 2C-E experience had brought me back into a balanced mindset for this trip.  I was a nervous about MC'ing a party later that night but thought that being altered would help to overcome any lingering anxiety.  I also wanted an alternative perspective on some issues in my life so beforehand I wrote down some things to think about.<br>
 <br>
Drop time: 7:45 pm <br>
 <br>
I came up evenly, sitting in a quiet room in a library, looking at an orange/black/white floweresque abstract painting that filled one wall.  I had a small notebook and my mp3 player.  I listened to Vivaldi and then Matisyahu.  This heavily Judeo-Christian music lead me to think about how Christianity has been perverted over the centuries and theorize about why people love Jesus.  Once I felt I had come up, about an hour after drop time, I decided to head back to my dorm.  The effects were quite strong and pleasant, like mushrooms colored by the speediness of LSD.  Euphoria deigned that I dance to the music on my mp3 player on the way back to my dorm.  <br>
<br>
I talked to some friends, who found my musical choice strange but were going out for a stroll and a joint, so I decided to join.  I was having little difficulty with social interaction at this point, but this encounter brought me back to earth a bit.  Walking around the neighborhood surrounding campus, my first feelings of paranoia emerged after a few hits of cannabis.  I found my friend’s behavior creepy in respect to an aquaintance who was with us.  The cannabis was intensifying the trip greatly and I had a strong desire for solitude.  Crossing the street seemed much more dangerous than I normally consider it.  I stopped to wait for a car to pass while my friends passed in front of it with no problems.<br>
 <br>
Once I got inside I dropped off my coat and talked to my roommate and a few others who were passing by my room.  Then I went to the dining hall, where it was dark and there was no one milling around, sat down cross-legged between the wall and a table, and peaked.  ”Brief ego-loss.  Fucking incredible.  I am a member of the cult of creation,” I wrote sloppily.  I felt like I connected directly with the concept of creation, divinized by popular religions as Yahweh and Brahma.  It was intensely blissful — a transcendent mindspace.  I had a vision like a spinning flower coming out of a black hole.  It was an incredible, dynamic representative visual, like a mandala, and seemed to represent my conception of the creative process.  I was up around that level for an indeterminate amount of time; flowers, stars, crosses, crowns, eyes and pyramids danced behind my eyelids, reflecting my thoughts and the music I was listening to.  <br>
 <br>
Once I started coming down from that himalayan peak, I got up and went to the bathroom.  With open eyes I was experiencing incredible visual patterning: the bathroom seemed to breath with me and the yellow speckled turquoise carpet in the lounge became distinctly patterned, like a vine with long and elliptical leaves transposed on the carpet in two dimensions, the entire hallucinatory organism interconnected.  It was like an open-eye version of a closed-eye visual I had on salvia.  At the time, about a year earlier, I could only describe it as an infinite marching zipper with reptilian features.  Naturally, my pupils had overtaken my irises.  <br>
 <br>
I sat in the lounge for a while listening to a friend play piano; my RA came and sat across from me, asking politely for my permission.  He said that watching the play of emotions on my face from across the room with the music in the background was like watching the opening credits of an existentialist film.  His presence didn’t bother me much, although I had difficulty with lucidity and social interaction starting after I smoked cannabis and lasting for about an hour after my peak experience.  Sitting in the lounge, I had some social insights that made me more comfortable with emceeing a party in a friend’s dorm room as I had promised to do.  Most people at this party were aware I was tripping and I felt uncomfortably self-conscious under their gazes.  <br>
 <br>
I fear I did a bad job emceeing the party, as I was not nearly lively or engaging enough to make our Greek symposium theme any more than an excuse to drink sangria and pour libations into a cavernous mixing bowl at random intervals.  The party was popular, though.  The room was comfortably packed full, I poured everyone generous drinks, we bribed the student security personnel with bacchanalia, everybody got drunk and eventually left to go to house parties or pass out.  During this time I had mostly come down, drinking sangria and conversing.  Past the party my memory is foggy.  As far as I remember I ventured out to a house party, talked to a few people, got bored and went back to the dorm, now more drunk than tripping.  The 4-AcO-MIPT experience lasted around six hours, with some residuals coming back after smoking a bowl in the early morning.  The next day there was a dull pain in my mind from consuming more alcohol than was wise and a mild, trippy afterglow.<!--   End Body   -->

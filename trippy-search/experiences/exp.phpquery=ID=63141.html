I have been a relatively frequent (multiple times a week) marijuana smoker for the past year or so of my life, but only recently have I ventured into other drugs such as ecstasy and prescription meds.  Just for informational purposes, I'd like to add that I'm fifteen years old.<br>
<br>
About a week ago a friend of mine had acquired sixteen pills of Percocet, each containing 10 mg of oxycodone and 325 mg of acetaminophen, and bearing the imprint 'Watson 932' on them.  I purchased all sixteen of them, and I took two the very next day, along with three small bowls of weed.  It was my first experience with any form of opiate, and the effects of the Percocet itself were hard to identify past the high from the cannabis, so I decided the next Sunday to do three before school on Monday.<br>
<br>
I took the pills about fifteen minutes before first period began (7:40 AM) with a small bottle of Orange Juice, my drink of choice.  Ironically, we were discussing the dangers of drug use in my first period (health class).  About half an hour after taking the pills I felt a warm tingling in my abdomen, but attributed this mostly to psychological effects.  Around forty five minutes into the trip was about the time I really began to feel anything.  I am generally a happy person, but I noticed a considerable mood lift and I became very relaxed, thought not in the 'couch-glue' kind of way weed tends to induce.  These feelings continued to increase until about 9:15 AM, when I peaked out during Science class.<br>
<br>
Because the peak is undoubtedly the most interesting part of any trip, I feel it is especially important to detail that part specifically.  I remember walking into class around nine o' clock, a grin on my face and my body buzzing quite pleasantly.  I had to talk to the teacher about a late homework assignment, or something of that nature, and I had trouble conjuring words to fit my thoughts.  Similar to cannabis, I could think up what I believed to be brilliant ideas or well-constructed sentences, but when I tried to speak it all became jumbled.  The teacher suspected nothing and I went quietly to my seat.  The peak consisted mostly of what I would expect from smoking a half a gram or so of really good indica.  A very pleasant body buzz, along with feelings of relaxation and sedation.  I am typically very carefree, and this was further amplified by the drug.  I swear I could have seen something in the room spontaneously explode and have given it no more than a passing glance.  I wasn't what I would call 'euphoric' but just pretty damn happy all around.  Also, I noticed the analgesic effects of the oxycodone the most during the peak (makes sense doesn't it?).  I did what I sometimes do when I'm drunk, slapping my face lightly a few times, just to see how it feels.  Sure enough, it didn't hurt hardly at all and I found the feeling to even be a little bit enjoyable.  I continued slapping myself (mind that it wasn't very hard) until the teacher became irritated and demanded that I stop.<br>
<br>
Around that time I began to come down.  I have done ecstasy twice, and both times the comedown (which is notoriously harsh) wasn't all that bad.  That being said, perhaps I am not as prone to after-effects as some other people (if that is scientifically possible, I'm no expert after all).  The oxycodone set me down very gently.  From about 9:20 AM to 10:30 AM I began to feel less and less of the mood lift, but the relaxed feelings remained for the remainder of the day.  Throughout this time I became increasingly itchy all over my body (if I had to pick a spot where the irritation was most constant, I'd say it was around my back and shoulders).  Truthfully this did not bother me at all.  Much like slapping myself, itching felt rather good.  By noon I can fairly say I was back to a mostly sober state.  During PE, my last period, I was a little bit slower (in both reaction and agility) than normal, but not to the point where functioning was significantly impeded.<br>
<br>
The rest of the day, between waking and going to sleep for the night, were uneventful (at least in relation to the oxycodone).<br>
<br>
I woke up the next day feeling normal.  I smoked before school so I could have the pleasure of giving my health presentation on illegal drugs while baked.  I skipped my last period of the day to smoke a pretty hefty joint with a friend, and I was home and napping by three in the afternoon.  I woke up around four or five, still feeling okay.  I lay in my bed, letting my mind wander around various subjects, for about half an hour.<br>
<br>
Soon I began to feel irritated.  My room appeared to be very messy.  Several years ago I was diagnosed with mild obsessive compulsive disorder, so spontaneous urges to clean my environment are nothing new to me.  This, however, did not feel like a normal OCD bug-out.  I felt very depressed and angry.  I wanted to scream, 'MY FUCKING ROOM IS DIRTY!' over and over again, but I didn't want to alert my dad, who was home from work by that time.  I began to clean, feeling more and more depressed as time dragged on.  By nine o clock I had tuckered myself out just picking shit up around my room, and I settled down to bed to listen to Pink Floyd's 'The Wall', which is great music for when you feel angry or depressed.  Sure enough, it seemed to help, and I fell asleep within a few tracks.<br>
<br>
I cannot say it for sure, but considering that I had smoked weed that day and that I am usually a very happy and chilled out person, I assume what I experienced was a mild oxycodone withdrawl.  I had done 20 mg on a Friday, and 30 mg the following Monday, and had my 'withdrawl' that Tuesday.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I would like to say that while oxycodone is a great drug that is a lot of fun to do, I will be cautious about how often I do it.  I cannot say for sure that what I experienced was a result of withdrawl symptoms, but I would say it is better to be safe than sorry.<br>
<br>
That's all from this here kid, stay smoky everybody,<br>

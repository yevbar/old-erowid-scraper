Trazadone is not really for recreational use, since it is nothing but a powerful sleeping aid, but if you're looking for a long and deep sleep, Trazadone is what you're looking for. I have taken this drug on several occasions, and it's great for sleeping. The pills I take are 50mg each. Here is a little chart of what each amount of Trazadone will do.<br>
<br>
50mg-100mg: Within an hour of taking the pills, I will feel tired, but not to the point of passing out or anything. This amount of Trazadone will usually give me a good night's sleep without waking up during the night. Dreams may be clearer than usual, and I may remember them with more accuracy than usual.<br>
<br>
150mg-200mg: After taking 3 pills (or 150mg), I will feel the tiredness feeling come on slowly. Within an hour, I will be very tired. Four pills (200mg) will make me feel extremely tired, almost to the point of passing out. Taking 150mg-200mg of this drug usually causes me to have very vivid dreams, and I am usually able to remember them much clearer than I normally would. I haven't had a lucid dream while taking this drug as of yet, but I would imagine it is very possible. When I take Trazadone, I usually sleep at least 8 hours. One time when I took 4 pills (200mg) I slept for around 11 hours.<br>
<br>
When I wake up from sleeping, it takes me an unusually long time to get fully awake. Also, my eyes always are red, almost bloodshot, for about 30 minutes after I wake up, which is a clear sign of deep sleep (which is good, considering this is a sleeping pill). The day after taking Trazadone, especially after large quanties of it, I feel very drowsy and tired. This doesn't really occur with dosages of 50mg, but it will occur with higher dosages.<br>
<br>
Positive Effects: Works wonderfully as a sleeping pill. It makes me very tired about an hour after taking it, and gives a great sleep with vivid dreams.<br>
<br>
Negative Effects: The day after taking Trazadone is always clouded by drowsiness. I just feel tired and uninspired for a large portion of the following day. Some caffeine or some other kind of stimulant should take care of that.<br>
<br>
Overall, this is not a recreational drug. It is a sleeping pill, but a powerful one at that. If you are having trouble sleeping, I suggest you take Trazadone. I don't use this drug on a normal basis, just every once in a while, so I have not noticed any negative physical effects.<!--   End Body   -->

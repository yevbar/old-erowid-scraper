Although I have used Soma several times this report will detail my highest dose experience (4 350 mg tablets).<BR>
<BR>
Background: Being faced with another boring school day and wanting to get f'cked up, I decided to pop my remaining stash of Soma. I had taken two OO size pills of Yohimbe that I had made with fresh ground bark about 36 hours ago. No other meds had been taken. Pills were taken on an empty stomach. (It's noted that the Soma's were generic-being white and imprinted with a italic v and the pill code (sorry I didn’t pay much attention to the numbers at the time.).)<BR>
<BR>
The Experience: <BR>
<BR>
[8:35 am] From past experience, I know that the pills take about 2 hours to take full effect, so I proceed to the bathroom and ingest the first 2 pills. Mindset at the time was happy and relaxed. The pills are hard to swallow due to the size but I managed and returned to class.<BR>
<BR>
[8:45 am] Ingested 2 more pills.<BR>
<BR>
[9:15 am] Slight intoxication, most likely placebo.<BR>
<BR>
[9:30 am] Intoxication gone. Must have been placebo.<BR>
<BR>
[9:45 am] Peak is felt 45 minutes early, something that has never happened with me taking Soma. Beginning to feel moderate intoxication, which consists of extreme muscle relaxation, a need to move and talk, and some mild euphoria.<BR>
<BR>
[10:00 am] Muffled hearing is experienced, along with 'slow-vision' when I turn my head (everything coming to view a second late, somewhat like nitrous) and a distinct distortion of distance (everything appearing and feeling much closer than normal).<BR>
<BR>
[10:15-45 am] Effects keep building...no new effects noted as of yet.<BR>
<BR>
[11:00 am] A odd effect that I have never experienced started, somewhat like slow-vision except slow memory. Can only be described as doing everything at normal speed but having the mind focused on a few minutes ago, by the time it catches up I am already a few minutes away again. Quite odd...<BR>
<BR>
[11:15 am] What I believe to be the peak. Feels much like being drunk. Feels great to just move in circles or to walk around. I have noted that while walking its difficult to stop where I plan to, making me end up closer that intended to objects or people. Hearing is extremely muffled, making it hard to have a conversation with someone even at close range.<BR>
<BR>
[11:30 am] Schools out, somewhat tricky to walk down stairs but I manage.<BR>
<BR>
[11:45 am] First meal, consisting of a small sandwich and soda. Pills showing no sign of wearing off quickly like previous doses.<BR>
<BR>
[12:00 pm] Tiredness felt, a first for me on Soma.<BR>
<BR>
[12:30-1:45 pm] Nodded off. Woke up and could STILL feel intoxication.<BR>
<BR>
[5:00-ish] Went for brief walk, could feel pills wearing off with each step.<BR>
<BR>
[5:45 pm] Back to baseline.<BR>
<BR>
Summary of effects:<BR>
(In order of appearance)<BR>
<BR>
-Mild relaxation   )<BR>
-Somberness - Placebo??<BR>
-General Euphoria  )<BR>
-Disappearance of all previous effects<BR>
-Relaxation, Somberness, and Euphoria return<BR>
-Feeling of drunkenness (Peak)<BR>
-Pleasure in movement & slow-vision<BR>
-Distortion of distance and time & slow-memory<BR>
-Difficulty walking<BR>
-Gradual comedown, then total absence of effects<BR>
<BR>
Pill effects appear to increase in the beginning by ignoring them. I've used Soma about 10 times and this is the only time where distinct effects were felt before the 2 hour mark, but then I have a high tolerance to pharms in general. Separating the dosage times and eating apparently affect absorption and excretion time. Also water was drunk at regular intervals of about 20-25 minutes, however I barely had to use the bathroom during the trip. Generally effects last only 30 minutes to an hour for me with a slight tapering of effect followed by total sobriety, sometimes mid-sentence. Soma is definitely one of my favorites, possibly comparable with alcohol or small doses of Oxycodone.<!--   End Body   -->

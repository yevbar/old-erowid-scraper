To fathom Hell or soar Angelic<BR>
Just take a pinch of psychedelic<BR>
-Osmond<BR>
<BR>
Introduction:	I have been an avid user and lover of marijuana for the past year and a half, although I tried it for the first time a few years back. The drug’s effects are very calming and therapeutic for me. Before 2C-B my drug use was somewhat limited, consisting of cannabis, vicodin, nitrous oxide, muscle relaxers, and alcohol. Three month’s ago I decided to try some new psychoactives, officially beginning my “experimental phase.” Recognizing it as such, I made sure to do thorough research on anything I was considering trying beforehand, checking it for permanent effects, addictiveness, and possibilities for allergic reactions. I believe that if a person is thinking about experiencing a new substance, they should make an educated decision based on logic after weighing the pros and cons. Since 2C-B looked safe and enjoyable, and a friend just so happened to have some ready to sell (does $20 for one pill seem a little steep?), I decided to try it.<BR>
<BR>
T + 0:00	I had just gotten out of my morning Anatomy class and was done for the day. The time was 10:15 AM. I had eaten a full breakfast about three hours ago and was a little hungry.  With nothing else to do and eager to experience a new psychoactive, I took the one 20mg, red 2C-B pill I bought from my friend (I’ll call him L) earlier that week. About five minutes afterwards, he came to my room and told me that I should smoke some cannabis to help relieve the nausea associated with the drug’s effects. We smoked about 2 grams of dank between the both of us and went down to the cafeteria to get something to eat.<BR>
<BR>
T + 0:45	I was beginning to feel nauseas despite the marijuana (which usually clears up everything from headaches to hangovers for me) and did not think eating was a good idea. At this point I began to feel a body rush, as though I was accelerating very quickly. The cafeteria was full of people and was very loud, which was not the environment I wanted to be in while awaiting the effects of a new drug. We went up to L’s room to watch some television. After about five minutes of this, the screen began to swim and the wall was sort of pulsing. I could feel my train of thought changing and became confused and paranoid. I excused myself and went to my own room.<BR>
	<BR>
T + 1:00	When I entered my room, I did not recognize it. I walked through it, telling myself out loud “This is my guitar, this is my bed, this is my desk,” and so on, just to comfort myself. I shut and locked the door, peering through the peep hole a few times as I was still paranoid. I felt sicker than before, so I turned off the lights, closed the shades, played the soundtrack I prepared for this (mostly live Pink Floyd tracks), and laid down. Immediately, the nausea left me and I experienced intense open-eyed visuals. My white, blank ceiling looked like water and oil mixing together, swirling around with colors. I flipped over and closed my eyes and it appeared as though I was criss-crossing over red and green pillars. Not only this, but the body rush I felt, which was now more powerful than before, seemed to follow the motions. Everything I looked at was swirling and moving around. Around this time I also started to feel over-heated, a feeling that was not too uncomfortable but persisted throughout the experience. My roommate walked in, and I told him that I was going on a trip and should be back in a few hours.<BR>
	<BR>
T + 1:30	The visuals were now even more intense, and about as intense as they were going to get. My roomate told me afterwards that I looked paralyzed and was staring at my ceiling without blinking. When I closed my eyes again, small images and scenes were going through my mind very quickly, about one every five seconds, and I was a little disappointed I couldn’t dwell on and explore them. My mind was racing so fast that I was having trouble listening to my music, it somehow felt more frustrating than calming so I got up and turned it off. Standing over my computer, I looked around my room and realized I could not remember anything from my life, particularly my daily life. I remember thinking to myself, “Is this how I live day to day?” It all felt very dull and boring. Around this time I began feeling very sexual, but this was accompanied by a strange feeling of guilt and pain. The hornier I got, the more spiritually disgusting I felt. Eventually, I found myself praying to God as hard as I could, asking Him to forgive me.<BR>
	<BR>
T + 2:00 	I looked in the mirror for the first time on the trip. My pupils were huge (which explained why everything seemed so bright) and I was very pale. Eventually my reflection began twisting and turning the same way everything else I looked at was, which disturbed me a little. I went back to bed and experienced some very interesting geometric and fractal hallucinations. My mind was racing faster than ever and time was going by very slowly. This made it very hard to relax or concentrate on anything. I would watch 5 minutes of TV, turn it off, listen to 5 minutes of music, turn it off, lay in bed for 5 minutes, get up and walk back and forth.<BR>
<BR>
T + 2:30	 L came by and asked how I felt. I responded that I felt like I was thinking inside-out. Although I can’t explain it now, I remember that’s how it seemed to me. It was as though I was aware of my brain’s programming and it was changing. He asked if I wanted to smoke a cigarette, so I went to the bathroom to wash up. I felt like a giant in the bathroom, as though I was standing tall above the sink and the person next to me. The walls were breathing in and out in unison. I put on sunglasses and we went outside. Sitting out in the shade with a cigarette proved to be very relaxing. This was the first time during the experience that I felt really good. I felt calm and intensely at peace with my inner-self. After twenty minutes of this we went back up. (The elevator trips up and down were also interesting. Again, I felt like a giant and the walls were breathing in the same fashion as before).<BR>
<BR>
T + 3:00	For next hour and a half, all that I felt was euphoria. Visuals were much less intense, although still present. I mostly just sat up in bed thinking about my past, present, and future, and was completely comfortable and at peace with it. As my roommate put it, I was staring off into space with a “big goofy grin on my face.” Everything just felt real good. There isn’t much else that can be said about this part.<BR>
<BR>
T + 4:30	By this point, I was starting to come down. After half an hour, I was mentally exhausted and mostly void of thoughts or feelings. I was hungry for the first time since I took the pill, so L and I went to Hardies (smoking weed along the way.) I could barely interact with the cashiers. I must have stood staring at the menu for five minutes without actually reading it until I finally blurted out “Number five and coke.” It was the best sandwich I ever tasted. I was really tired by the time we got back to the dorms but was unable to sleep. I’m not sure if this was from the pill or my general insomnia, but I popped two muscle relaxers and drifted off into a long, deep sleep.<BR>
<BR>
Reflection:	After 2C-B I believe that I now know the difference between experiencing a “high” and experiencing a “trip.” In my opinion, drugs like cannabis change the way I feel, while drugs like 2C-B and mushrooms change the way I think. When used responsibly, I don’t see why these psychoactives cannot be used as a tool to explore the inner-working of one’s mind and spirituality, as well as for recreational purposes. Having been raised extremely conservative and Christian, I am glad that I am thinking for myself and coming to my own conclusions, and suggest everyone to do the same through self-reflection. Some of my friends have told me that after their first hallucinogenic experience, their entire perspective changed and their lives completely turned around. While I would not say the same is true for me, I do look at some things differently now. For instance, I take my future more seriously, focusing more on what makes me happy. All in all, I am glad that I took 2C-B (although I don’t see how Europeans party on it) and feel ready to try other hallucinogens, namely mushrooms and eventually LSD.<!--   End Body   -->

I was eager to finally try a pure isolate of lagochilin that I had finally sourced. I had been involved with getting lagochilus earlier than this experience, and consumed the herbal product a year or so ago. I had been ripped off a substantial amount of money initially by an inept Albanian doctor who sent me kilos of the wrong material. So I was very eager to push the envelope of dosage of the reputed desired psychoactive component, lagochilin.<br>
<br>
It was around 11pm after work. I had taken some daily opiate dosages earlier that evening, and a few hits of cannabis a few hours prior, but being a regular user I was pretty much baseline. I am perticularly interested in diterpene pharmacology, and thus so far have rounded up several plant species that contain active diterpene compounds, one is even a kappa opioid agonist, and a beta endorphin type agonist. looking at the reports of usage and effect available on lagochilus I considered that diterpenes similiar in structure found in lagochilin might perhaps be a gabba, benzo, or opioid agonist in nature of effect. So after work I vaporized 20 some milligrams of this lagochilin in a clean glass ginseng bottle, the material harsh, and raspy but not too bad tasting. Mildly floral, the scent was noticeable I think in the smoke of the whole plant.<br>
<br>
What I considered might be a mild effect seemed to creep over me, a mild stimulating feeling, clarity of mind, but nothing strong. So I layed out 3 20 some milligram piles of the material and insuffilated roughly 20 milligrams. The material burned ever so slightly, and seemed to dissolve and saturate very quickly. After waiting 5 minutes, and sitting in a relaxed mode in my basement study, I finished the last 40 some milligrams.<br>
<br>
10 minutes later I find myself feeling pretty good, comfortable, and mildly stimulated, the amount of plant material in my nose was about gone, and I noticed a general feeling of well-being. As the night went on, around 1 pm I started nodding off at the computer, which is NOT a normal thing for me to do, even when taking my moderate daily dosage of a pound of poppy seeds, 150 milligrams of tramadol, and a 3rd of a gram of 50% alkaloid kratom extract throughout the day. I sat and nodded and scanned the internet in a very relaxed and interested state until sleep got the better of me, and I woke up at 3:30 am and went to bed.<br>
<br>
I felt no hangover in the morning, like higher dosages of opiates will do to me, and no hangover like taking large amounts of gaba might. I will try higher dosages probably. I am very glad to have had the experience of searching out an unknown and finally getting the chance to experience the material. I have moved my main interest on to other plants that are very rare or non existant for all I know in the united states, mostly opioid in nature, and some with real 'potential'. I think lagochilus should be taken up as a possible medicinal herb, it has already been profiled by the American Botanical Council as such, seems like ethical harvesting and supply/price is all that is holding back lagochilus as a herbal supplement.<!--   End Body   -->

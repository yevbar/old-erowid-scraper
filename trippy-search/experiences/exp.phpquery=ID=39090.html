<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: 15 grams of mushrooms is considered an extremely high dose, see Mushroom Dose Chart]</FONT><br>
<br>
Well, first of all, I am an exceptionally experienced user of psychoactive drugs, as well as most other drugs around.  I have an exceptionally high tolerance to hallucinagenic properties, an example is after ingestion of an eigth of mushrooms I get no visual experience whereas others I do drugs with get very good visuals.<br>
<br>
So, the night began and my friend, Kyle, came over and suggested we pickup an eigth each and take them at about 8pm.  Well, no coincidence my roommate had 4 eigths laying around he was waiting to get rid of and 2 were supposed to be for Kyle and I.  So, we took them and proceeded to just mess around and do our own thing till the shrooms started to kick in.  After about an hour (9pm) I noticed the usual odd (and actually I hate this) body high that one gets off shrooms, and also very clear perception of the world.<br>
<br>
For the next hour we were in and out of my house walking around just generally enjoying our trips, while I had no visuals everything had a very clear look and it was just very defined.  Well, after that we sat down and just decided to watch Resident Evil, so after watching the movie I started to come down as it was ending about 3hours after ingesting the original eigth.<br>
<br>
Just then my other freind Jake said we should go smoke.  This was at about 11pm.  So I decided to kick the shrooming up a bit and go smoke with him and his friends.  I ended up takeing 1 hit out of a 3 foot bong, and we passed around 3 bowls between 4 people.  I do not smoke much so the weed hit me pretty hard.  The whole time we were watching the butterfly effect which just turned my mind into some twisted world.  I began questioning my own existance and so forth.  <br>
<br>
Well, after we were done smokeing Jake said he wanted to get some shrooms too and his friend grows them, we left at about 12am.  So we went to his friends place and for $35 he gave us 3/4 of an ounce.  We sat there and I was pretty messed up and running my mouth talking about paradigms, paradoxs, and some other crazy stuff, the whole time just chomping down shrooms.  Well, after about 15-20minutes the whole bag was gone between my friend and I, and I had ingested the better portion of the bag (about 3 to 3.5 more eigths) at which point both of them pointed that out.  This whole time I had been, in the back of my mind, been proving my existance over and over again, and everytime I would disprove it and have to go farther to prove it.<br>
<br>
Well, about 20-30 more minutes went by and I got hit by a brick wall while playing a bit of Halo.  I start to blackout a bit here due to excessive ingestion of the poisonous mushrooms, but we were at this guy's appartment for about another 30minutes ad I remember the two guys I was with started changing in my perception.  I looked at their faces and I could notice distinguishable 2x2 blocks on their faces, but it was like it was part of them.  Well, this is where things begin getting extremely foggy.<br>
<br>
I do not remember leaving this guys appartment, nor do I remember how we got back to our house, but suddenly we are in Jake's room (and apparently I was there for about an hour) sitting in complete darkness aside from a blacklight.  I only remember being in there for about 5minutes of which my whole time was spent reclining his couch, then standing up, sitting down again reclining it, in a repeating cycle.  I do not remember much of what I was thinking, except that I was most likely on the same track of questioning existance.<br>
<br>
Then I 'shroomport' as we like to call it (due to excessive blackouts when I take a goodbit, I sort of teleport around) out into the hallway walking towards my room.  At this point I notice that my vision is absolutely horrible, I see only a very very small area in front of me partially clearly, it was like looking thorugh a telescope lense, without things being magnified.  The vision outside this 'lense' was extremely blurry and I could barely make out that it was the real world.  So, through all my screwed up thoughts, I finally realized I was way too messed up and regained a bit of conciousness with which to walk to the bathroom and attempt to throw up.  Obviously I wasn't thinking too clearly as it's been about 2hours since I ingested the rest of the mushrooms.  Well, I knelt infront of the toilet and jammed my fingers as far down my throat as I could with no response, I did not even gag, whereas normally I would have thrown up at even a slight bit of my fingers in my throat.  <br>
<br>
Well, after failing at throwing up I attempted to stand in and fell inside the toilet and was swimming around in there for what seemed like an eternity.  Finally I got out of that little visual and teleported into teh hall again and then another time into my bed to lay down.  My freind Kyle was sleeping on the floor and my roommate in his own bed, so I laid down on my bed and attempted to sleep.  Well, for the next 4hours I had the most intense mushroom trip of my life.  It was the greatest and worst experience I ever had.<br>
<br>
As I was laying in my bed soon everything began forming into 2x2 blocks and eventually the world ripped appart into long verticle strings of these, they were the 2x2 stacked upright one each other  and between each one of these verticle beams was space and time.  The verticle beams began spinning as if that was time in motion.  All at once I began whirling through time seeing lives, some in teh past and some that were to come.  I could not distinguish who these were or what was actually going on in these lives except a small (what seems like 2minute) exerpt from one life that was definately a past or future life I would live.<br>
<br>
I was wheel chair bound with no legs or arms and in some sort of hospital, I have no idea what I looked like beyond those physical deformations, but I could tell it was or would be me at some point.  At some point, I came a slight bit back to consciousness as if forgetting about myself completely and asked if my friend Kyle was alright, after he said yes and went back to sleep I began tripping again.  Right back into the fray.<br>
<br>
Another visual I had was of the 3 of us in our room (my roommate, kyle and I) and everything was overtaken by a haze of pink, everything was tinted it seemed even the air itself.  Well, apparently we were all homosexual from what was said by my roommate (I will not actually type what he said but suffice to say it confirmed my feelings that we were all homosexual) and by what I was thinking at the time.  Also, I knew this for certain was a punishment that would be to come after teh trip was over if my life was deemed unworthy.  After a few minutes of seeing this (although it could have been 10seconds to 3hours long for all I know, time had no meaning at this point) it left with a quickness and I was back flying through space and time witht eh spinning wheels.  <br>
<br>
But now, they weren't so much wheels spinning vertically as they were almost diamond shaped.  They were still spinning vertically but they seemed to be going downward to some unknown point.  I don't know if I noted this before but every spinning diamond was one life, and they seemed huge and to go on forever.  At this time a 'voice' spoke to me and told me that life does matter and that if I live a good life I will be rewarded, but if I do not I will be punished, and I was being given a second chance at this point to make some good of my life, at which point I felt a warm sensation, which I now know was me urinateing myself, but it felt like my soul was being placed back in my body. And at some point, possibly the end of the world or when everyone finally lives a good life, I do not know, we will come to an end that either ends in us discovering truth or we will restart the cycle again, I do not know the prereqs for either, but only that it will happen. <br>
<br>
At this point I fell asleep for approximately an hour and woke up around 6:30-7am to my roommate and kyle leaving for work asking if I was ok.  I said yes, and that I had a crazy night and would talk about it later.  They left and I went to bed for another hour, woke up and vomitted for about 20minutes straight all this brown liquid.  Later I talked to my roommate about the night and apparently for the 4-5hours I was having that intense trip I was screaming at the top of my lungs.  Also another thing I forgot to mention was that I was spinning my right arm, no doubt the physical representation of myself flying through the 'diamonds' of time, and my jaw was jacking something fierce and it felt as if my face was being torn appart.  I remember thinking at some point during the night that I would have a dislocated shoulder and a broken jaw if I ever woke up from the trip.<br>
<br>
Another thing my roommate told me is that at some point during the night I stopped screaming incoherantly and yelled out a 10 sentence string of obsenities and hit kyle in the back of the head, which I have no recollection of.  He also told me that at one point he was affraid I was tirpping so hard that he was affraid I was going to be locked into some psychotic state for perhaps my whole life because I was completely unresponsive and just out of my own mind and body the whole time I was in my bed.<br>
<br>
There was a bit more to it, but after a bit of time what I do remember is fadeing and also there is about 30 more paragraphs I could write but it would just make this even longer and more boring.  This was like a harsh LSD trip and I would not trade the experience for the world, but I would not like to go through it a second time.  It was something to learn from, and a new way to look at the world for me and I would not trade it for anything even my own mental health.<!--   End Body   -->

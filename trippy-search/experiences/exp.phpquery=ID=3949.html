Synthesis: 20mg 2C-T-2 HCl was dissolved in ~5mL dH2O.  To this solution was added three drops of 10% ammonia.  The resulting 2C-T-2 freebase was extracted with methylene chloride.  A small amount of NaCl was added to the remaining ammonium chloride/water solution and another methylene chloride extraction was performed.  Approx. 16mg of 2C-T-2 freebase (with maybe some NaCl in there too) was successfully extracted.<BR>
<BR>
I smoked 9-12mg of the freebase; the smoke tasted terrible.  At twenty seconds there was a bodily alert, and in one minute the psychedelic effects began to present themselves.  I found myself relatively clear-headed, with an increasingly intense body buzz and visuals characteristic to the 2C family.  At 5min, I threw up and felt somewhat better.<BR>
<BR>
My senses were sharpened very noticeably by the drug; I exited the bathroom to be bombarded by the smell of pizza from the kitchen.  I decided that pizza was not what I wanted to smell (my stomach was still shaky) and retired to my room.  I stayed there for about 45min, listening to music in the relative darkness.  Open eye visuals were pretty; no closed eye visuals were noticed.  Mentally, I felt pretty normal. It didn't feel much like an oral dose.<BR>
<BR>
I got up and took a walk with my friends, in the cold night air.  I felt much better and over the course of the hour felt the 2C-T-2 fading. By 2.5h, I was nearly down and by 3h I couldn't notice any effects other than a slight headache that the 2C-Ts tend to give me in their aftermath.<BR>
<BR>
Smoking 2C-T-2 was certainly effective, but I don't think it had much to say to me other than 'Your walls are pretty' and 'I taste like shit.' I think I'll stick to oral administration.<!--   End Body   -->

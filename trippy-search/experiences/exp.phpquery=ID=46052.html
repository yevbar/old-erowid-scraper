<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</FONT><BR>
<BR>
All the research chemicals I've received have been very pure, clean and glorious. Except one: A gram of 5-Meo-AMT. I ordered a gram of 5-MeO-AMT for $135. I was expected to have some of the greatest experiences of my life on it, as it is probably my favorite drug of all time(and I have done probably  around 100 different drugs, believe it or not, including all the drugs that I have mentioned so far in this report, as well as marijuana, alcohol, cocaine, all opiates, LSA, mysticism, Salvia, LSD and just about every other drug imaginable(mainstream and mainly unknown).<BR>
<BR>
My first dose on this batch of 5-Meo-AMT was 13-13.75MG. It was the day after I received it. It had been nearly a year since I had used it (I had been avoiding it due to how addicted I am to it).<BR>
<BR>
Mindset: I had dosed on 25MG's of 2c-E at 8:30am the morning of this experience. I had an amazing trip(since I hadn't done any 2c's in about two weeks. I had thrown out over $1000 worth of Research Chemicals at that time vowing I would never do drugs again, but look where I am just two weeks later.) I was baseline by 7:00pm. I was a little worn down from the 6-7 hour 2c-E trip but overall positive and excited. Let me state for the record I like 2c-E more than 2c-I. I experienced no cross-tolerance during the 5-MeO-AMT experience later that night.<BR>
<BR>
My experience: I'm not going to get to detailed into the positive effects, although I will talk about them a bit. The main purpose of this story to tell of the misery bad batches of chemicals can cause.<BR>
<BR>
7:00pm: I dosed on 13MG of 5-MeO-AMT. I had it in the bottom of a small glass in my car. I poured water into it and drank it, I then repeated this a few times to make sure I got all of it. I didn't get off work till 9:30pm; WHAT A MISTAKE! I had eaten a lot of food that day so I figured it would take a while to kick in; What a miscalculation! It's odd the way sometimes drugs kick in 15 minutes after I dose on a full stomach, and sometimes take over an hour with the same drug on an empty stomach, and vice versa.<BR>
<BR>
7:00pm: Feeling fairly nauseous. Visuals already kicking in.  I feel like I'm on ecstasy. Everything going well so far, nothing too intense yet.<BR>
<BR>
7:45pm: Tripping nicely. I work at an Office Supply store(I was a cashier that night). I was struggling to pronounce words and getting caught in stutters. Extreme nausea is coming in waves, almost unbearable at times. Visuals are becoming more and more intense. I'm having difficulty walking already. I start to become scared but then I realize whatever happens I'm not in control of at this point. I consider purging but decide not to.<BR>
<BR>
8:30pm: I'm battling puking. I'm trying my best to convince myself I don't really have to puke, it's barely working. I am SO UNBELIEVABLY nauseous. Visuals are amazing. All my co-workers faces are swirling and warping. <BR>
<BR>
9:05pm: Still battling with the nausea. Knowing I will puke soon if I don't get to my car and smoke some Cannabis. Visuals are just out of control. I am having extreme difficulty walking straight. I am excited as to what is to come that night. We are closed now and I ask to please leave early. Everyone knows I'm on drugs so they know I will be of no use and allow me to leave, at least I think they all do.<BR>
<BR>
9:15pm: Take a hit of marijuana on my way out the parking lot. Pull down a side street and smoke a bowl. Ahhhhh, partial relief from the nausea, although I don't feel the weed at all somehow. Luckily I don't have far to drive home, and my mom is at her boyfriends house tonight. Driving is about as difficult as after drinking at least 2/3 a fifth of 100 proof alcohol. I make it home by 9:30pm.<BR>
<BR>
10:30pm: I'm starting to plateau. Absolutely amazing. It feels like I'm on a ton of PCP, with 5 hits of acid, some ecstasy, DXM, benadryl and 2c-E all in one. The visuals are out of sight, better than any drug. A lot of emotions in this place, much laughing and crying. The scariest, yet most amazing parts of the trip has been when I got sad, mad or had bad feelings. I heard witches screaming, see them right in front of my face, see them take weapons and swing them at me. <BR>
<BR>
I watch my blood streaming everywhere, feeling their contact to me. I see demons, rotted bodies, and people that have robbed and abused me in the past. I hear witches scary HAhaHAhaHAhaHA in that screeching childhood way. It seemed so scary although I had never been scared of it before. <BR>
<BR>
Every fear I've ever had in my life, even if I didn't have them anymore faced me that night. I don't think my fiancé got any sleep between when she went to bed at 10:00pm till I fell asleep at 7:00am. I kept running to her to comfort me when I would get scared. I kept expressing thoughts and theories about death, life, society, anthropology, philosophy and everything in between. I kept expressing my extreme love towards her. I could NOT STOP talking to her. I drove her absolutely nuts. In between all this I would have profound spiritual and amazing experiences, some indescribable. This drug is pure 'infinite bliss', as I once heard someone describe it as. It's the best drug ever. Music is profound on this compound.<BR>
<BR>
11:00pm: This is where the trip gets bad, REAL bad. Over the past half hour I've started to itch VIOLENTLY. I go into my bedroom(where my fiancé is sleeping) and beg her to scratch me. She rubs moisturizing and anti-itch lotion all over me for hours. None of this helped, it was like the itch was coming from inside my body, underneath my skin. I take shower after shower hoping it would ease the pain. I am tripping so intensely yet its hard to pay attention to at this point. <BR>
<BR>
At times I become dissociated and have a great experience for a few seconds, only to be overwhelmed by itching again. My whole body feels like its falling apart. I have never felt an itch like this, not from any drug even the most extreme of opiates. I don't know what could have caused this reaction. I smoke weed continuously hoping to ease the pain.<BR>
<BR>
1:45am: I am out of weed and haven't smoke since about 12:00am. I am still in the plateau of the trip and make an amazing stupid decisions to drive to the heart of the Detroit Ghetto to see a drug dealer. I am swerving from lane to lane. It's like I've drank a fifth, smoked weed, Taken PCP, Acid and DXM. The visuals were so intense I couldn't see street lines and could hardly see other cars. I somehow made it home okay. By the way before this week I hadn't smoked weed in almost a year (drug tests). I'm going back to jail so I said fuck it all. I'm going to sneak research chem's in through my ass. I continue smoking cannabis, taking showers, rubbing lotion and itching UNCONTROLLABLY. I don't think I have ever been so uncomfortable. This body load is not normal on 5-MeO-AMT, something is terribly wrong with this batch of it.<BR>
<BR>
3:00am: Still peaking and fighting the horrible body load.<BR>
<BR>
4:30am: Start to feel the intensity tapering off, although still tripping hard and itching horribly.<BR>
<BR>
5:30am: Have come down a little bit more, although still tripping strong.<BR>
<BR>
6:00am: Smoke almost all the rest of my weed in hopes of falling asleep and sleeping through this madness.<BR>
<BR>
6:45am: This is the last time I looked at the clock. I believe I feel asleep by 7:00am. I was itching and fighting a sick body load up till I feel asleep. <BR>
<BR>
12:00pm:(5 hours since I fell asleep): I wake up to my alarm. I have to be at work by <BR>
<BR>
12:30pm. I reset my alarm for 12:20pm in a moment of pure stupidity. I wake up again at <BR>
<BR>
12:20pm. I am EXTREMELY TIRED. I am still itching. I decide I need to dose on more drugs in order to get through a grueling 10 hour work day. I take 10mg's of the 5-MeO-AMT(how messed up is that, what an addict). I rationalize in my head that since the tolerance will be there it will just give me a nice energetic edge and not itch me that much. I also dose on 15mg's of 2c-I, 20mg's 2c-E, and about 400mg's of caffeine. I don't trip hard at all. I itch ALL day at work and sweat profusely, just as I did the night before at work(I forgot to mention that[the sweating]). <BR>
<BR>
11:00pm: I get to my fiance's house. I cry for an hour, pop 4 benadryl to help me sleep and drift into a sleep. <BR>
<BR>
Retrospect: I take it again 2 days later. I take 25mg's to cover the tolerance. Thats what I hate most about most hallucinogens, the tolerance is overwhelming and comes in a matter of 1-2 doses.<BR>
<BR>
I dose 25mg's 2c-E two hours after dosing on the 5-MeO-AMT. I trip fairly hard, not nearly like I did in my last trip. The itching kills me again, although not as bad as before.<!--   End Body   -->

Alright... For those of you who have tried high doses of 5-MeO-DMT, you will understand how it is almost impossible to summarize it all into one short trip report. Please bear with me, this is very hard to explain.<br>
<br>
Dosage - Unknown, all I know is over 20MG.<br>
<br>
Setting - A dark room with a scented candle.<br>
<br>
Method of administration - Vaporized.<br>
<br>
8:00PM - I have been waiting for this moment for a while now. This is the moment that I dose up. I put about 5MG in my lightbulb with a little foil scoop-like thing that I made. There is also the resin from the DMT last night in there, which is a bitch to get out.<br>
<br>
Everything is perfect. My parents aren't home and nothing can bother me now. At least that's what I thought!<br>
<br>
8:10 - After talking to my friends on chat for a while, I finally get the candle lighted and wrap the tape around my lightbulb cap.<br>
<br>
I phone a friend of mine so that I can talk to him during my trip.<br>
<br>
I light a scented candle, and use that to light the DMT. The same thing like last night happened when lighting it, it turns to liquid and crawls up the sides of the bulb. This pissed me off.<br>
<br>
8:15 - The lightbulb is full. I take a deep breath and am extremely confident. I take my hands off the holes and inhale everything, slow but steady.<br>
<br>
The smoke is very harsh. It sure doesn't taste like the nice grape smell this drug has. It taste like terrible plastic fumes, irratating my throat.<br>
<br>
8:15:30 - It has been about 30 seconds. My hit is still deep in my lungs, yet I am forgetting what a 'hit' is. I am forgetting what everything is.<br>
<br>
8:15:45 - I finally let the hit out. As I let it out, I am in a 'daze'. Everything seems like it is a dream. I am coming up extremely fast! My head falls back onto my chair and I drop the bulb. I find myself gazing at my textured ceiling. It is melting down on me and swirling all around my room.<br>
<br>
I want to be amazed, but I forgot how.<br>
<br>
8:16:30 - I am almost fully up now. I have no idea what is going on, I can't even tell if my eyes are open or not. The visuals are so stunning, yet that is not what i'm concentrating on. I am concentrating on the body high. It is so amazing! This is what I imagine Heroin as. The body high itself is as if I am in a freezing cold snowstorm in the middle of nowhere, and stepping into a bubbling jacuzzi extremely slow.<br>
<br>
Within the last minute I must have fell off the chair, because when I finally open my eyes, I am on the floor.<br>
<br>
8:18 - I am laying face flat on the floor, gazing into the universe, not knowing what to think... Not knowing how to think.<br>
<br>
8:25 - I finally get myself back on the chair and manage to grab the phone and start talking jiberish and mumbling to my friend. I have no control over my body. I sprinkle about 17MG more into the bulb. I didn't know what the hell was happening, but it wasn't me loading this bulb up and taking this hit. I was trying to stop myself, but my body just kept on going.<br>
<br>
8:26 - I finally give in and take the hit. I hold it in for about 25 seconds.<br>
<br>
8:26:30 - At this point, I can't really remember much. I think I had multiple Out of Body Experiences. I could astrally project myself anywhere. I had no idea where I was. I didn't know what was real and what wasn't. I think my eyes were closed.<br>
<br>
The word 'Closed Eye Visual' doesn't even come close to describing what is going on with me right now. This is not no CEV, this is real. I am really in these places. I find myself in a gorgeous Japanese garden. I find myself floating by a star in space. <br>
<br>
... I find myself staring into infinite.<br>
<br>
Above is the only way humanly possible to describe a 20MG 5-MeO-DMT trip. I cannot even come close to summarizing the next 30 minutes.<br>
<br>
Approximately 8:50PM - I am still full-on tripping, though I have regained the ability to type and think more straight. I finally find the phone and try to explain with words what is happening to me to my friend. I later realize that whole time I was pretty much mumbling the whole time.<br>
<br>
The rest of this trip is not important, and if I were to try and type it, it would take up a whole page. There were some bad moments in this trip which I would rather not mention. There are so many miraculous events and things that happened during this trip which I just can't put in words, no matter how hard a try. And belive me, I tried.<!--   End Body   -->

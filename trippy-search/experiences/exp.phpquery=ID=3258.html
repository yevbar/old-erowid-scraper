Friday, October 6, 2000 12:31 PM <BR>
<BR>
(+0:00) At 12:30pm, I swallowed approximately 25.7mg of a white powder received from a trusted source that is known to be 2C-E.  I dissolved it in orange juice and drank it down.<BR>
<BR>
I am home alone today and do not expect any interruption until between 8 and 9pm.  I woke up this morning feeling good about the world.  By the time I was done with breakfast, I was improvising a little tune about how I'm in love with the world.  So... it's a good day.  My set is good.  I'm in the house I share with my lover.  It's a warm place for me and I feel wonferfully at ease in every room in the house.  <BR>
<BR>
The only pre-conceived notions I have about this substance is what my source told me from Hir experience with it.  SHe said it reminded Hir of mescaline, and that Hir experience was very internal.  SHe said that if SHe had had any healing to do when having this experience, it would have been done.  I have some healing to do.  I have been recovering slowly from a bout with major depression that had me debilitated completely for two weeks and had been building for 6 months prior to that.  It's been 4 or 5 months since that episode, and it does take a long long time to explore the psychological forces that contribute to such a condidion.  I'm hoping this substance will be good for such exploration.<BR>
<BR>
Other medications that are in my system:  I take 400mg of an antidepressant called Serzone (nefazodone).  Serzone is not an SSRI or a MAOI, but exists in a class of it's own.  A friend who researches such things says it's a '5HT2 Receptor Blocker'.  It does have Serotonin reuptake action, but also appears to block postsynaptic serotonin receptors.  It is prescribed as a mild treatment for depression & anxienty.  I take 200mg in the AM and 200mg in the PM.  i have taken my AM dose today.  I also took my once-daily dose of Wellbutrin (Bupropion 150mg daily) which is also to treat depression and is often used with Serzone.  Aside from antidepressants, I took Allegra (Fexofenadine hydrochloride) extra-strength, a decongestant called Enomine (guaifenesin/phenylephrine/phenylpropanolamine).<BR>
<BR>
For breakfast  I had a bowl of bran cerial with soy milk at around 10am.<BR>
<BR>
(+:11) It's 12:41 PM.  <BR>
I feel that initial mild neck and head buzz that i always get shortly after taking any substance.  I believe it's more of a psychologically triggered reation of anticipation.  but it is a feeling unique to taking a psychoactive substance.<BR>
<BR>
(+:30) 1:02 PM <BR>
Starting to feel the slightest alarms consisting of a noticable change in my sense of balance.  Time for a shower.  <BR>
<BR>
(+1:08) 1:38 PM <BR>
There is no doubt that I am on the rise now.  It feels a good bit like 2c-b at this point.<BR>
<BR>
(+1:21) 1:51 PM <BR>
I feel quite a bit like i ate mushrooms or something.  similar visuals, body feeling, desire to lay down<BR>
<BR>
(+1:36) 2:06 PM <BR>
It feels a lot like mushrooms but with a different 'taste'.  I find myself thinking about friendships a lot.  I would also describe it as having a quality like 'black pepper' which is also how I have felt with Foxy.  it's a buzzy burny feeling as if my main 'energy channels' had a touch of heartburn.  Not severe, but present.  It's quite pleasant overall.  Tortoise's album TNT is ... i cannot think of a more perfect album for this mellow and thoughtful headspace.<BR>
<BR>
(+1:58) 2:28 PM <BR>
I've had two brief friendly phone calls, and both were fairly easy to navigate.  Tho, i still get a sense that this substance is still developing, or 'coming on.'  I'm basically very relaxed.  I'm thinking a lot about how I treat people.  My tentency to judge myself harshly on such fronts is relaxed, tho I do still find myself feeling sorry.  Very sorry for treating people, especially my sweetie, harshly in little ways.  Little dismissals.  Little digs.  Little lashouts.  This substance is good for 'digging in the dirt' as they say.  I'm finding myself getting some of the 'work' done that I wanted to do.  it's happening very naturally.<BR>
<BR>
(+2:32) 3:02 PM <BR>
I've been stretching and I'm energized & half-tempted now to go jogging.  The day is nice for it.  But for now, jogging in place will suffice.  I feel as if I have emerged from what was the head-trippy segment of this experience.  I spent a lot of time curled in a ball on my bed  feeling out events of my past, and trying to imprint some more positive approaches for my future.  Now that I think about it, I could easily fall back into that fetal position and resume course, as it were.  I have been, for the last few minutes stretching and bouncing around.  I feel good.  I feel whole, in tune with my physical container ('my body').<BR>
<BR>
(+3:36) 4:06 PM <BR>
Came back from short fifteen-minute walk and went right back into that headspace.  Had some memory come up that caused me a big startle.  I awoke out of whatever trance I was in with a exclamatory shout, disturbed, looked around, and then I could not remember what it was I had remembered that caused me a start.   It seems as if the memory came up, was painful and was supressed again immediately.  This is the 1st time I've had such a close look at such processes as they happen.  I can't for the life of me remember what it was, nor could I a second later... but I know it was something and it has a 'on the tip of my tongue' quality to it.  It was quite disturbing, but only in that moment.  Once it was 'buried' again, I retained only the memory of the intensity of being startled that way.  It's intriguing.  I hope I get to brush up against that memory again.<BR>
<BR>
I feel like I am off peak now.  This is a pretty intense substance.  I like it VERY much and would do it again.  I have been getting a lot of 'work' done today, I feel.  So while i'm off peak now... I'm still very much still up.  I feel happy and energized and like getting up and DOING SOMETHING!    I often feel this way after the heaviness that the 1st few hours a mushroom trip has.  Overall, i would say that this 2c-e is comparable to mushrooms... in many ways.<BR>
<BR>
(+4:29) 4:59 PM <BR>
I'm feeling tired.  I was able to eat a pb&j sammich, which eased some hunger.  I've. been able to do little more than lay down and listen to music since.  I'm definitely feeling tired, and a bit more prone to thinking sad thoughts.  I'm also feeling rather cold.  Cold sad and tired, huh?  what a combo.  It's not as bad as it sounds.  It feels like a natural aftermath.  But then again, laying down i can sink back into that headspace again.<BR>
<BR>
(+5:05) 5:35 PM <BR>
I stood outside on the front porth watching the rain, which was sometimes torrential.  I'm still feeling a tiredness.  I'm still thinking about things and working through personal issues peacefully.  I'm still definitely under this substance's influence.  I still feel  the body effects.  My vision is still 'affected' tho it's hard to describe exactly how.  I can read decently well.  I feel alert and mellow, not particularly energized, but not down or sad at all.  <BR>
<BR>
(+7:54) 8:26 PM <BR>
I'm not totally down, but mostly there.  The down-swing has been slow and gentle.  My vision is still affected, but only subtlly.  It's been a potent day.  <BR>
<BR>
Some Final Thoughts:<BR>
I would definitely enjoy experiencing the effects of this substance again.  The ~25mg dose was very solid.  I might push it a bit higher next time, but not too much.  Maybe I would try 30mg.  I have not tried mescaline, but I have had some powerful mushroom experiences.  I find similarities between the two.  I felt very in touch with my thoughts and feelings, and able to examine and map some uncharted mental teritory.<BR>
<BR>
I remember having some interesting closed-eye visuals now and then, while laying on the couch listening to music in the headphones.  The visuals were not nearly the center of my experience, however.  I found myself easily falling into an open relaxed state like that which hypnosis sessions have taken me to, and I value that more than visuals anyway.  I experienced no real 'ego loss' in the bewildering and confusing way that LSD can cause me, but I found my inner dialog absent when not directly interacting with certain memory-emotional triggers.<BR>
<BR>
I would love to explore this substance more, less for the fun of it than for the reflective and open headspace it provided me.<!--   End Body   -->

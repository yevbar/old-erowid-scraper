Description:<BR>
male, 20 years aged<BR>
Have tried mushrooms 7 or so times previous, as well as other psychedelics.<BR>
Never tried caapi or rue or similar substance before.<BR>
<BR>
Preparation:<BR>
I had a 30g bag of ground Banisteriopsis caapi. I did not feel comfortable with the idea of mixing it into water and drinking the solids. Most of the extraction recipes called for mixing it with some sort of acid and water, and straining the mix with cloth. I thought it would be a good idea to use a coffee maker. Though, I had to buy one, and it has only been used since for this occasion. I crushed some vitamin c pills (the pure kind, not the rose hips type) and mixed it into the water for the coffee maker. Normal water can absorb some of the alkaloids, but an acid helps it absorb more. The coffee maker makes 10 cups, and I used about half the bag (15g). The amount of water was enough for four cups, but two cups worth evaporated/absorbed into the caapi during the process.<BR>
<BR>
The amount of mushrooms I took was not enough for a good level 3 trip, but I expected quite in increase of potency due to the MAOI chemicals in the caapi. Also note, I did not eat any meat or protein foods that day. I expected an upset stomach, so I did not eat dinner that night.<BR>
<BR>
Another person was there to share the experience, and a roommate was home, but I did not expect him to join us or even be awake for much longer.<BR>
<BR>
Experience:<BR>
The mushrooms were placed in the yellowish liquid, and I nauseatedly drank it between 9 and 10pm.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the trip itself was not too different from others. The come up was not different, nor were the visuals. The potency was noticeably increased due to the caapi, but it was not above my experience. It seemed to be for my friend, who had jaw spasms and uncoordinated movement. I learned that he had coffee throughout the day, which I thought would be bad for him, but after a bit of food and water, he seemed fine.<BR>
<BR>
The roommate joined us in talking and doing whatever random things we did that night. I don’t talk much, but I listened enough to compensate, I suppose. I would say that my short-term memory was much worse than the average mushroom trip. Self-introspection came easily.<BR>
<BR>
Then it was 3am (5-6 hours later), and I had left reality behind me. It happened in a flash. It was somewhat logical, however. I suddenly saw signs everywhere -- in front of me and from my memories -- that this world was only temporary. For example, my shirt said “Close the world, open the next” on it. I realized the world was made to hold unenlightened people until a soul learns of his position and leaves the body to go to some sort of heaven. Quite a change in belief from an atheist…<BR>
<BR>
Shortly after my friend left, I ran after him, thinking that he was going to take me from this world to a higher plane of existence. I had conversation with him that seemed to prove all my new ideas. When we started walking back to my apartment, I realized that I was not going forwards, but back into my life, which was hell in comparison. So, I started running from my friend.<BR>
<BR>
He chased me down, and I stopped a few times to listen to him, but I was too set on the idea that he was keeping me from heaven. He was now a demon after my soul. I escaped by running down a street, and I noticed a house on the street. The porch light was on, so for reasons unknown to even me, I started to bash down the door with my shoulder. It finally gave in, and I stumbled right into the dining room. A male teen came out into the hall in front of me, who then asked what the f*ck I was doing. 'I need help! I'm sorry- I don't know what I'm doing,' I managed to reply. I assume he went into a room behind another guy there to get a phone, but then I suddenly thought they were more demon-humans. I noticed a bike on the porch, and though it a good idea to use it to get away.<BR>
<BR>
My mind raced with nonsense about how my life's near end will transport me to heaven. While shouting, 'I need help!' at the dark houses on the street, I crashed the bike, and I fell into the street's gutter. But, I don't stop there! I run the hardest I’ve ever had in my life, up to another brightly lit house. I amazingly used the doorbell. I remember a middle-aged man answering the door, and I'm pretty sure I told him I needed help.<BR>
<BR>
There is a gap in my memory, probably from the lack of oxygen my run caused. I turn around and walk to the middle of the yard to the small birdbath. I basically fell over, and knocked it over like a domino. My head hits the ground again, and the fountain rolls onto my arm, capturing it. I screamed 'God, why me!?' and a few obscenities.<BR>
<BR>
The teen from the previous house caught up with me and put his leg on me to hold me down. “I got you now,” he said. I didn't try to get up, but it was only a couple seconds later before a cop pulls up. I found out later my friend got the police, and I don’t blame him for doing so. Though, one of the worst deductions in my life was that I thought the cops were yet more demons, trying to capture my soul.<BR>
<BR>
I didn’t try to get up, and I didn't resist when they handcuffed me, but it became apparent that I was going to have to endure a lot of pain before going to heaven this night. As I hopelessly fought the handcuffs, I looked around and saw many police officers while the man in the house and the teen stared at me. To make a long story short: It took more than a few cops to tie me down to a gurney and haul me into an ambulance. <BR>
<BR>
I arrived at the ER, and I played with the officers and ER crew, not giving any information (I did not have my wallet/ID with me). I remember an officer asking me how I had grass stains on my underwear, which he then added, “maybe I don’t want to know...” Wouldn’t I like to know! Also, the doctor told me at some point that my heartbeat was 140bpm.<BR>
<BR>
I  was calming down from the lorazepam they IV'd me, but my beliefs were still strong. I found out what a catheter feels like that night. Not too long afterwards I passed out. My next memory was walking into a jail holding cell, where my friend was in. I was completely out of it - from the drugs and the sedative. I couldn't even think, so I passed out again. I woke, and I realized my left arm was in a sling, and I was wearing hospital scrubs. My friend was gone, but I was released that day.<BR>
<BR>
Conclusions:<BR>
<BR>
Bad.<BR>
<BR>
My advice is never leave the area of your setting, especially when trying a new substance. And, always keep in mind when you’re incapacitated that you are in fact incapacitated.<!--   End Body   -->

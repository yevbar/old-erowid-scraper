I had just re-organized my collection. Within a locking briefcase in a refrigeration chamber, there are four folded plastic bags, labeled ‘T’,‘P’, ‘E’ and ‘O’. These subdivide my  collection into four categories: ‘Tryptamines’, ‘Phenethylamines’, ‘Ergotamines’, and 'Others'. I withdraw from container ‘T’ a series of much smaller individually labeled baggies, containing six different compounds in two to three different dosage options per compound. 5-MeO-MiPT and AMT were recently added, and 4-AcO-MiPT should arrive soon, which will expand the 'T' class up to seven options.<br>
<br>
My 5-MeO-MiPT powder came in a small trade done with a friend, no money involved.  I received a vial containing a fine white odorless powder, similar in appearance to 5-MeO-DiPT. Some reports have described Moxy as more mentally profound or more physically benign when compared to Foxy, either of which would be encouraging characteristics.  I decided to give it a try.<br>
<br>
Timeline:<br>
<br>
Saturday, Noon: I swallow a gel capsule containing six milligrams of 5-MeO-MiPT powder. I wash it down with some soda and watch a video on my computer while awaiting the onset.<br>
<br>
T+0:15: There are already alerts. Energy is forming in my stomach and moving throughout my body. It's sort of pleasant, but it makes me dizzy. My heart is starting to flutter. As it becomes increasingly difficult to monitor my own heart rhythm, I am reminded of the feeling of coming up on Foxy.<br>
 <br>
T+0:25: The heavy feeling in my heart retreats and the discomfort seems to pass. The focus of the substance’s physical effect shifts from the internal to the external. I feel it in my skin now… goosebumps are forming on my arms. I feel a little warm.<br>
 <br>
T+0:30: The body energy picks up with a vengeance. A second wave of dizziness accompanied with irregular heartbeat descends. My blood pressure increases noticeably. For a few minutes my stomach tightens up and I border on feeling nauseous. Then the stomach tightness passes, but the increased blood pressure remains.<br>
<br>
T+0:35: There are little waves of euphoria, a few odd grins. Good appreciation of music as I listen to one of my favorite old bands from high school. The excellent musical appreciation may be the strongest trait of this substance. I'm still breathing heavily. <br>
<br>
T+0:40: A change in my vision is starting to occur. I see the walls ripple for a second, then it stops. I see shifts in color tone and hue, and subtle textures with my eyes closed. But nothing continuous. Just hints that come and go.<br>
<br>
T+0:45: My pulse is rising and falling unpredictably.  My skin feels strange… sensitized, yet sort of numb. Most of my muscles are tight. I strap an electronic blood pressure cuff on my arm and determine that my pulse is up to 95 from its resting rate of 75. Somehow it seems much higher than that... possibly due to time dilation, though my ability to judge the speed of moving objects in my field of vision seems normal. There is little or no tracering. My torso feels very heavy.<br>
<br>
T+0:50:  It is difficult to focus on anything for long. There is not much tactile enhancement, but a strong head rush. I wonder if I should have started with a lower dosage. I also wonder how much of this substance it would take to cause a disaster for the human heart. <br>
<br>
T+1:00: I'm clear-minded enough... this substance could be good for analysis. But all I can bring myself to analyze at the moment is how inferior the 5-substituted tryptamines performance compares to that of the 4-substituted tryptamines. <br>
<br>
T+1:15: My pulse has risen again, to a little over 100 beats per minute. It somehow feels much higher than it actually is. I want this out of my system. But it’s too late. I kind of wish I could vomit, to purge out the bad and hasten my return to normality. It would be impossible, though, as the substance is completely non-nauseating at this point.<br>
<br>
T+1:20: Pulse drops again, slightly. I'm getting the chills, though. Shivery and shaky.<br>
<br>
T+1:30: I take my temperature. It reads 95.6 degrees Fahrenheit, about a three degree drop. That explains the chilliness. <br>
<br>
T+1:35: I get into the shower, hoping the warm water will help me relax.<br>
<br>
T+1:45: Getting out of the shower, my discomfort ebbs. I continue checking my pulse and temperature periodically, and look forward to their returning to normality.<br>
 <br>
T+2:00: Pulse is up to 107 bpm and temperature is 96.5 degrees (still slightly reduced). <br>
<br>
T+2:25: Very slight visuals continue to come and go. Shining and shimmering, like the dazzled eyes of a wanderer stranded in a hot jungle. Just the slightest hints of color change. Nothing too interesting or unique.<br>
<br>
T+2:30: Pulse is still at 105. I can't believe some people find this substance 'erotic'. I'm glad I just had some meaningful sex the night before because no eroticism could be possible right now.<br>
<br>
T+2:35: I am drinking lots of water so I can flush my system out. I alternate between listening to music in my den and watching TV in the living room. <br>
<br>
T+2:40: Temperature is 96.7 F. Pulse is down to 98 bpm. Breathing still feels labored.<br>
<br>
T+3:00: My pulse drops a little... back down to a gentle 92 beats per minute, a definite improvement.  Every slight drop in pulse rate feels very relieving. My temperature is slowly rising again; currently it is at 97.2 F. <br>
<br>
T+3:30: There has been a significant drop in effect over the last half-hour. My pulse is back down to 85 and I'm feeling pretty damned decent. There are vague mental effects: My thoughts wander and a certain playfulness of thought finally manages to develop. A pleasantly-intoxicated headspace emerges, clear-minded enough for easy communication, yet spontaneous and silly. There are still faint traces of visual activity. <br>
<br>
T+4:50: The substance tails off slowly. It is almost completely gone now, but not quite. I have been watching television with my girlfriend and enjoying it. She noticed how agitated and uncomfortable I was acting earlier, and is glad to see my mood improve. My pulse is down to 82 bpm.<br>
<br>
T+5:30: Back to baseline.<br>
<br>
Conclusions:<br>
<br>
By the end of the day, 5-MeO-MiPT left me feeling pretty good. I ate dinner eagerly, and stayed in the apartment for the entire day, joining my girlfriend for the later part of the evening. I slept well and operated normally the next day. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, both the come-up and the peak with this substance were uncomfortable. I felt physically exhausted from a half-hour in to about the three hour point... labored breathing was a very predominant trait. The effect on breathing was reminiscent of smoked 5-MeO-DMT experiences, but drawn out over a longer period. The visuals were subtle, natural, and organic: Reminiscent of the slight visuals one would get when they were extremely exhausted from many hours of outdoor hiking. Or perhaps comparable to the tricks the eyes play when one is extremely tired but strains to remain awake. <br>
<br>
I can see how this substance combines the traits of 5-MeO-DMT and 5-MeO-DiPT. What surprised me about this particular analogue was its great potency. Both 5-MeO-DMT and 5-MeO-DiPT require at least ten milligrams before they start to produce significant discomfort for me. 5-MeO-MiPT is surprisingly powerful with only six milligrams.  Perhaps I should have heeded TIHKAL dosages and started with four. <br>
<br>
I'm inclined to think the 5-substituted tryptamines are not worth the trouble, particularly the oral isopropyl analogues, Foxy and Moxy. And particuarly with so many wonderful 4-substituted variants of the tryptamine molecule available as alternatives. The heart-related side-effects are too pervasive and the psychedelic effects are too subtle. I probably will not explore 5-MeO-MiPT any further. It’s just not my cup of T.<!--   End Body   -->

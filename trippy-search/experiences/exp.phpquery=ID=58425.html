<!--   Start Body   -->


Starting around age 35, I started having severe bouts of fatigue, which would typically hit around 1pm. This was causing me to lose productivity at work - and it was noticed. Even though I was sleeping a good 6-7 hrs a night, the fatigue became a monster that would absolutely rob me of any ability to be productive for a few hours every afternoon. It took all my might to stay sitting upright in my chair pretending I was figuring out programming problems on the computer at work. It was painful. Usually starting around 4pm or so, the fatique would slowly recede and I'd rush to get the work done that I was supposed to get done that day. Sometimes I'd have to stay late to get it done.<br>
<br>
I went to the doctor, and told him about my problem. He was quite unhelpful. After a blood test, he said everything was fine, and simply recommended that I stop eating foods and drinks with sugar in them.<br>
<br>
Yea well - I went ahead and stopped drinking soda pop and avoiding candy bars. And the fatigue did lessen - a little. But it was still there. Instead of a 10 ft. tall monster, it was a 9 ft. tall monster. <br>
<br>
I eventually lost my job due to poor productivity. But I found another job - telecommuting. I could crash in the afternoon, and then pick up again after I got back up, and finish the rest of my work at night. But I was still not happy about losing 3-4 hours out of every day due to my afternoon fatigue.<br>
<br>
Then I read about modafinil. I got a package of Modalert soon in the mail. 200mg pills. Even though I read that it was helping people, I was not optimistic about it. I had resigned myself to a life handicapped with fatigue, and I really felt hopeless about it. So, when that daily fatigue started setting in around 1pm, I took half a pill. 5 minutes nothing. 10 minutes nothing. Then a wonderful thing began to happen. The fatigue was dissolving! I could feel it going away. And in about 30 minutes - I was wide awake - and eager to continue with my work. If I was religious, I would have dropped to my knees and thanked God for this miracle.<br>
<br>
This stuff works for me. No more fatigue in my days. I've settled on a schedule of 1/2 pill around noon, and if I need to continue working into the night, I take another half-pill around 5pm. I tried taking a whole pill once, 200mg - and I didn't like it. I was TOO awake, much too easily distracted by sounds and things.<br>
<br>
I have no intention of using these pills to stay awake for 'days at a time'. I sleep everynight, and it even seems that I've been sleeping better since taking these pills. <br>
<br>
Now - instead of stressing over not having enough time to get my work done every day, now I'm in the curious situation of having all my work done by 6pm, and then sitting around wondering what to do with the rest of my day. I've got various projects I'm working on now, besides doing my work.<!--   End Body   -->

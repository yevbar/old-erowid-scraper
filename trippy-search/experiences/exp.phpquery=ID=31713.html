This 2c-i trip is only to account for 8-10 hours out of 4 STRAIGHT DAYS of partying (no sleep whatsoever). I'll first give an overview of the array of things I was on and currently feeling BEFORE I took the 2c-i. It started Thursday with the consumption of a 10 mg Valium about every 30-45 mins or so. Me and a few other friends began to sniff away at the 8-ball (3.5g) my friend had recently purchased. Several MDMA pills were acquired and I then ate 3, all at the same time as I have noticed how weak and inadequate MDMA tends to be nowadays. By this point in time, I had between 90mg-110mg of Valium pumping through my veins...this being the most prevalent feeling of all that has been consumed. I’m then offered a so-called 20mg (I’m not sure how they weigh to that degree on the scale they had) capsule of 2c-i. <br>
<br>
I am feeling the MDMA a bit, but not much, this can probably be contributed to both facts of A. the amount of Valium and B. the weakness. After about an hour after the ingestion of the capsule of 2c-i, a strange new feeling is coming about me, starting with a warm body effect...similar to that of shrooms, but amidst the effects of the other drugs, its hard to tell what exactly was doing what at that point. <br>
<br>
It wasn’t until about an hour and a half to 2 hours after ingestion that I was positive I was feeling the foreign substance. The paint on the wall (which is intentionally supposed to look like the paint was splattered on) was the first thing I noticed starting to move, in fact I could see something to the effect of several ferris wheels covering every inch of the wall...each about 8 inches in diameter all right next to each other. They were spinning in place very fast and looked as if they were raised off the wall a bit. Everything was crystal clear, as if it was actually there, but unlike other hallucinogens I’ve taken, my mind ALSO remained clear, although working at a VERY slow pace. <br>
<br>
I couldn’t help but laugh at the things I saw as I had never seen anything like it before in my life. All the while that the wheels are spinning, its as if blue and green and red windows are placed in front of my eyes making the whole room look that color. I then look down at the dinner table. The dinner mats on the table raise what looks to be a foot off the table and begin to all simultaneously rotate around the outer edge of the table below them. The table (white colored in reality) is shifting colors the whole time. 'Want a line?' I hear while staring at the absolutely amazing visuals, I wasn’t sure if I did or not, I knew mixing coke with actual lsd only made me feel strung out and feel like shit, but this being a totally different chemical, I felt I should try. <br>
<br>
What luck, I take a nice sized line and get this...IT INTENSIFIES IT!!! Well, it intensified the visual aspects incredibly. After doing that line, a friend of mine, asked how I was doing, I looked at his face, and it immediately started to fall apart, his forehead was melting down to where his mouth was, his mouth and chin disappeared, I could see the trails from the movements he had made several minutes before. I told him how I was feeling...quite possibly the best I’d ever felt in my life. I was the guinea pig for the 2c-i so no one else was on it, but they do know what tripping is like, and even so recently one even was willing to try 2c-i himself. <br>
<br>
I then had a sudden urge to smoke some weed, so I packed a fat bowl and began smoking...my god 2c-i mixes with everything really well!!! One hit on the pipe intensified both mind and body so much that it took me a good 4-6 hours to smoke 3 bowls of weed, and I am not a slow smoker when not so heavily intoxicated. As instantly as I breathed the smoke out, a new visual would reveal itself. This time I’m in a room that is too dark to notice how the paint is painted, and I see patterns, best described as Shulgin describes it as Persian rug patterns, only they work their way around the room from one corner to the other, the color tinting of the whole room has yet to decrease and its been 4 hours now, if anything it kept getting more intense until about 4 and half hours...where it began to plateau...alas my peak, what a peak, the mount Everest of peaks. <br>
<br>
And still with every pull from the pipe or line that I take it would be magnified for the duration of either's high. (We ended up doing +1oz of coke that day easy) as I was coming down I was staring at the walls endlessly in hope that I wasn’t coming down, I was told by the person we got 2c-i from that it lasts 4-6 hours, and by the 6th hour, I wasn’t tripping anymore, and the body high was reduced from the 2c-I significantly...the MDMA wore off, I was reduced to the toxicity of the valium and coke. <br>
<br>
Anyways, since then I have been unable to obtain a trip quite so intense as this. Even after having just come down from doing 40mg of 2c-I just this past night. Since then I have had the chance to take 2c-I alone, and have found it to be quite pleasing although it could never touch that first time, I haven’t yet had the chance to do the same mixture again, and frankly doubt that I will…at least to the magnitude of that night. But I have tried 2c-I 4 times again since that day, 3 of those times I mixed it with coke and weed and I stand by my first statement, as my friend would also agree that coke intensifies 2c-I in a pleasurable way. <br>
<br>
Anyways that was my experience. I know lots of you are saying “Damn what a druggy” but I’m saying right back I’m no druggy…I’m a connoisseur whose hobby happens to be outlawed.<!--   End Body   -->

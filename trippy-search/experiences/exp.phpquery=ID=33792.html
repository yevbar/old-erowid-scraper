It was only yesterday that I proudly submitted my report of my first psychedelic experience in over 25 yrs (ID #33744).<br>
<br>
That report consisted of no less than three pages (on my WP program) dedicated to my reasoning for revisiting these chemicals as well as an exhaustive explanation as to how I went about ensuring that I measured my dose so exactly that I would stack my method against the measurment someone could get from a lab scale calibrated to .002mg.<br>
<br>
Today I decided to continue my exploration with the chemical 2c-i.<br>
<br>
I received one gram of 2C-I.  Although I do not have a scale I thought I had done an excellent job of  breaking down the quantity I received into 4 equal parts and then subdividing that amount so that I had created a dose of 10mg.  Well I was off a bit.  I was off by a factor of 10.  <br>
<br>
<br>
What I did for myself by choosing to ingest 2C-I was ……. Well there are no  words to end that sentence.<br>
<br>
I am 46 yrs old.  <br>
<br>
T+ 0:00 Ingested what I thought was 10 mg of 2C-I. At about 7:40pm.<br>
<br>
<br>
T+ 0:30  Came on with some visuals that were awesome.  Though my main reason for returning to psychedelics is not the groovy colors and moving walls and hearing light, it was a great side benefit.<br>
<br>
T+ 1:00  The intensity is awesome.  I am starting to see life and the Universe for what it is.  It IS!<br>
<br>
T+ 1:20.…Something is wrong,  Did I miscalculate the dose???????  Oh shit I did.  I took 100mg not 10.  Shit it could have been 150!!  Took 10 mg Valium<br>
<br>
T+ 2:20  Yesterday evening at 10pm I met God.  I have gone through life wanting so hard to believe and yet I never really knew for sure that a Creator exists.  Last night I learned that there is a God and that I am him and am not Him.  I saw what the universe is made of and how everything in that universe IS.  Just IS.  That God whether knowable or not knowable IS.  And that the Universe is a choice.  <br>
<br>
I understood and comprehended the meaning of the term dissociation and insanity and sanity and was at once sane and insane.  Man and God, Life and death.  Created in God’s image as He is created in mine.<br>
<br>
I saw time. I was time and time was all and nothing.  I am capable of all and nothing.  I saw the beginning of the Universe and time and chose to come back.  I saw humanity for what it is and for what we may become.  I SAW women for the first time in my life. We are so much the same and so different. <br>
<br>
I will know love and be able to love physically, mentally and spiritually now because love IS.  IT always has been and yet I never saw that.   I know love and peace.  I am love and peace.<br>
<br>
At T+ 5:00 I felt that re-association might be possible if I chose to do so.  Should I?<br>
<br>
T+7:00  I choose to re-associate.<br>
<br>
I must warn all that read this.   I nearly chose to not come back from sanity.  I nearly chose to stay at the beginning of the Universe.  I nearly chose to not live.  I nearly chose to not breath. I nearly chose to give myself back to God.  <br>
<br>
I took a dose of 100mg of this chemical.  And as my margin for error could surely have been 50% or greater, it is possible I took a lot more.  I had no sitter,  I had no partner.  No one knew what I was going to do.  I own no scale and thought I had a foolproof way of measuring a dose, I was a fool.<br>
<br>
I have a medical background and luckily I had medication on hand.  At 8pm I took 10 mg of Valium and did so again at 1pm and 3am.  Please understand that when I use the word “I” in this sentence it is applicable today as I write this note, but it was not applicable when I was on my voyage.  There was no “I”.  I was completely disassociated from T+ 1:00 until T+ 5:00.  I could just have easily chosen to take 10 valium at 8:00 and 10 afterwards 10 minutes earlier and 10 after that 10 minutes earlier.  For of course time was a choice at that point too!.<br>
<br>
Buy a scale.  Buy a .001mg scale.  If you can’t afford that buy a .005 mg scale.  If you can’t afford that buy a  .01mg scale, it is better than nothing.  If you can afford to purchase chemicals like 5-meo-amt or 2C-I than you can afford to purchase a .01mg scale.  IF you choose not to, use a liquid measurement method. The info. is there, that is where I learned how to do a liquid measurement.  If you choose to eyeball a 10 or 15 or 20mg dose of powder from a gram or half gram vial, may the Universe be with you and may you come back.<br>
<br>
IT is a truly wondrous gift.  It is a life changing responsibility.  I understand now what people mean when they say that they will need time to assimilate their experience.  I will need some time myself.<br>
<br>
I am forever greatful to the chemist whose expertise allowed me to be who I am today. I hope one day our paths will cross and I can properly thank him.<br>
<br>
My scale is on order.  It cost me about what a vial and a half of 2C-I costs,  I will revisit this chemical again.  And if I choose to return from my visit I will append this note.<br>
<br>
Peace.<!--   End Body   -->

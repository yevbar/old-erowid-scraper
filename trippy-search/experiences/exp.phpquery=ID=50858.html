This was my second time experimenting with acid and also most intense. I bought two blotter hits from a friend at band practice. it was a very thick deeply blue colored paper. I dosed 1 hit and had band practice which was the most amazing thing ever. it increased my musical ability 10 fold! After that, everything went down hill.<br>
<br>
It was winter and it was night time. We were driving to a friends apartment very close by but only made it down the street before crashing into a ditch. Typical. Since that happened, I kept asking myself and one other person I was walking with if we had crashed and died. He said 'Yeah, your dead.' to fuck with me, which turned out not to be a good idea. When we got to the apartment, 4 other people were there we knew. and everyone was on acid at this point.<br>
<br>
I dosed my second hit 45 minutes after the first, which was a big mistake. I underestimated the strength of my dose. Thinking I was dead this whole time, I now thought I could do anything I wanted without consequence. I almost raped my friend's girlfriend that was there (who was the only sober person) right in front of him thinking we could hook up cuz I was in fantasy world. I had extreme personality dettachment and ego dissolution. <br>
<br>
I preceded to trash my friend Dans apartment for no reason. I was dumping full ashtrays onto the floor, throwing videos at the door, knocking over tables and trying to break a window with a chair. He gave me a warning to leave but I could not communicate with anyone. I was totally disconnected from reality. He then punched me in the face and I flew backwards a number of feet slamming into a door. Although I did not feel one ounce of pain!<br>
<br>
I scrambled to my feet and ran outside and away as fast as I could. I then started breaking windows of random houses and running away into a main road with heavy traffic nearly getting demolished by speeding cars. My insanity was inconceivable. I thought I was in my natural element and was free. But in reality I had pissed my self and removed every article of clothing I had on, including my shoes, and was running down the street naked. <br>
<br>
The cops surely came and slowly rolled along side me talking to me. They asked me if I had taken any drugs and I told them I took LSD and thought nothing of it. I tried to run away but they tackled me and brought me to the police station. I also spit in the police officers face inside the squad car after him asking me a reasonable question. Being in police custody was physically painful. All I could think about was losing my sanity for the rest of my life and be institutionalized. After being processed at 4:30 in the morning, a cop took me home. I regained my sanity but was having extreme visuals on the way home. <br>
<br>
My little adventure had made the newspaper and everything. Days and weeks afterward I was depressed and extremely embarassed for what I had done. Try explaining that to your girlfriend who is the sister of the girl I tried to hook up with!!! All in all, worst day of my life. Still paying off lawyer debts.<!--   End Body   -->

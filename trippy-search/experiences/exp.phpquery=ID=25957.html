Sunday August 3rd, 2003<BR>
<BR>
18:00<BR>
<BR>
Substance: 4-AcO-DiPT, cannabis<BR>
<BR>
Dose: unknown<BR>
<BR>
Set: Things have been chugging rather smoothly lately. I seem to have gotten myself out of the 'bad trip space' I was in since my 9 gram mushroom experience. My trip for the 4th of July and the one 2 weeks later were both very pleasant, if mild, due to having to interact socially. <BR>
<BR>
This morning I visited a friend that I haven't seen in months. Then this afternoon I went to the pub for a meeting of local psychedelicists. And, finally, this evening I got to visit yet another friend I haven't seen for months. All this cavorting has my spirits in a thoroughly uplifted mood.<BR>
<BR>
This is my first time taking this substance, so I plan to start small. Plus, I am taking it at my 2nd friend's house ;-).  I am familiar with 5-MeO-DiPT and wonder how similar, if at all, the two will be. My inclination is there will be some.<BR>
<BR>
Setting: At my friend's house in the city. It is a beautiful, sunny day and the house is a magical place, decorated splendidly. Another friend from home is with us as well. I'm the only tripping today. I had a cheese-less salad with balsamic dressing and hot chocolate for lunch at the meeting 5 hours prior to ingesting the substance. I'm a bit tired; I was falling asleep on the way over to my friend's house.<BR>
<BR>
Report: [T+0:00] I eyeball out a small dose into a juice glass. In retrospect, guessing from the amount of material, my trip and the dosages listed on Erowid I probably had 10-15mg, but when eyeballing you never do really know :-/. I lick the substance from the tip of my knife, so that I might more fully know it. Its taste was mild, milder than anything else I've tasted - even 5-MeO-DMT. I don't find it repugnant at all and would have no problem holding it sublingually. However, today I choose to take it in some cranberry juice. I drink my juice over the course of  2 minutes, just as if it were a normal glass of fruit enhanced water, but of course it is not =). <BR>
<BR>
[T+0:11] I have the urge to ask what time it is. I'm not tripping, but I'd say the first, slightest alert. It’s just long enough, perhaps a second or two, to catch my attention, but too vague to really get a feel for how to describe it.<BR>
<BR>
[T+0:15] I feel a definite alert now and again ask the time. This alert starts slowly ramping up in intensity almost as soon as I notice it. It is some slight body energy and mild mind-alteration, perhaps equivalent to the hit of cannabis when effects are first felt. The effects keep growing as I sit on the futon. I get comfortable and start smoking some cannabis.<BR>
<BR>
[T+0:25] I'm definitely tripping now. I again ask the time. I continue smoking cannabis. My host checks in on me and notes that I'm definitely altered. Thoughts have the associational flair of cannabis, but remain unclouded. Some minor short-term memory impairment is there, but surprisingly little. I'm still coming up and simply lounge back to check this stuff out from the comfort of the prone position for a while.<BR>
<BR>
[T+1:15] I've reached the peak now. I'd say +1.5, flirting with a ++. It is a very nice substance so far. There is some nice body feel, similar to 5-MeO-DiPT, but I'd say about half as strong. My thoughts flow briskly, and do not run off into fantasy and are interesting. Mentally I prefer it to 5-MeO-DiPT. A slight headache is there at the back of my skull, but less than that produced by 5-MeO-DiPT.<BR>
<BR>
There is not a whole lot going on visually at this dose. The air is 'brighter', more so than on some other substances. I notice lots of flares from lights, windows, crystals and such. Depth perception is altered, but not in a way that makes it difficult to function at all. Rather, things simply seem to lie in different 'planes' if you will, almost like animation cells that are spread out to form the proper 'real world' size. Some very minor patterning, tending towards rounded forms.<BR>
<BR>
I put on 'Abbey Road'. It sounds excellent of course, but no more so than usual ;-). No gross motor impairment is noted. Some very minor tremor, far less than I get with 5-MeO-DiPT, is present and barely affects my fine motor skills.<BR>
<BR>
[T+1:30] I figure I'll check for CEV's on the off chance that I'm actually getting some. For some reason I hardly ever do :(. None are noticed, so I try staring at the lamp since my two best CEV's were solar powered, but to no avail.<BR>
<BR>
[T+1:45] I have a nice conversation with my host, which is not difficult at all. I am still peaking. We discuss my impressions of the compound and talk about literature.<BR>
<BR>
[T+2:00] I notice I've begun coming down and decide to smoke some more herb. I lounge on the futon and try to enjoy the remains of the day, sorry to see that the Sun's light is already dimming.<BR>
<BR>
[+3:00] The sun has left and my host informs us that he needs to go to bed soon, so we head out after I smoke one more bowl with one of the housemates. All the lights have prominent flares. On the bridge across the bay it seemed like we were going over 80 mph, but when I checked we were only doing 50-55. I’m quiet on the way home and just allow myself to get lost in my thoughts.<BR>
<BR>
[+4:25] I feel extremely thirsty and ask my comrade to pull over so we can grab a drink. I also get some sunflower seeds as the salad I had at lunch-time is all I ate today.<BR>
<BR>
[+4:50] We arrive home. I’m still slightly altered, but basically down. Essentially I note some mild “push”, like I get after a 5-MeO-DiPT experience. I didn’t have much difficulty getting to sleep despite the push, but as I said I was tired before ingestion.<BR>
<BR>
[+9:30] My headache wakes me up and I notice the push is still lingering. I take some Aleve to take care of my headache and drift back to typical sleep.<BR>
<BR>
Summary: This was a perfect introduction to the substance. Certainly not an overwhelming dose, like mine often are <g>. I liked the bit of mental effects I got and the body feel was an added bonus. I found it to have less body load than 5-MeO-DiPT, but they had some similarities. Already I think I like the 4-AcO-DiPT better though. I’m going to try it again in 2 weeks with about twice as much material. I’ll also be introducing it to my girlfriend at that time, at about 2/3’s of the dose I took.<!--   End Body   -->

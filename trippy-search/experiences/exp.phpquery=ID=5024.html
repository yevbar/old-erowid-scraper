Last summer I came across a 250 ml bottle of pretty strong nutmeg oil. There was to be a party down on the beach later that evening and I was very exited to try something new, and this is where the nutmeg came in. I had read a little about nutmeg on Erowid and Lycaeum and found that it could be drunk in warm milk. So, I warmed up 2 dl of milk and added 30 drops of nutmeg oil. Some people say that they don't like the smell and taste of nutmeg, but I like it pretty much and in milk it is rather good.<BR>
<BR>
The trip!<BR>
<BR>
17.00 I drank the spicy tasting tea and made ready to go out. I have read that nutmeg takes a while to come on so I was in no hurry.<BR>
<BR>
17.50 I went off with my brother. On the way to the beach I could feel some shivers in my spine, which were pretty nice. I could imagine what MDMA would feel like at this moment, while a warmth spread through my whole body. This part was really pleasurable.<BR>
<BR>
18.20 We came down to the beach and there were already some friends there, drinking and socialising. I felt the effects for another hour or so, very much like being stoned but different. I was from time to time very clear in my head and there was no paranoia like I used to get from THC.<BR>
<BR>
19.00 The effects seemed to increase a bit, but not much. At this time I started to drink beer and forgot about the trip for a while.<BR>
<BR>
20.00 I have no memory of the trip because of the amount of alcohol that I consumed. I think that the alcohol diminished the effects of the nutmeg.<BR>
<BR>
I found that nutmeg oil in a small dosage was quite nice and I am planning to do it again, this summer. Why summer? Because this feels like a summer drug, very fun to be out on a nice evening, just floating around with friends and having a good time. I have some plans for the first of May, so wish me good luck. I think that I should put the dosage up a little bit and not drink more than a few beers.<BR>
<BR>
Take care !<BR>

I never expected my night to be anything like it was. I had tripped on lsd quite a few times before this experience, but I had never truly had an out-of-body experience. I wanted to make sure I had taken enough to experience a real acid trip. Man, did I have it coming. It had been about 4 months since I last took lsd, and I thought it had been long enough of a wait to trip again. My friends told me that 'bottle caps' or 'sweet tarts' were in town. I wasted no time in buying some, however, I wondered how many I would need to take to truly experience an acid trip. I was told to take 2 bottle caps to achieve such a trip. I was then told that each bottle cap had about 3 hits on it.<br>
<br>
My settings for my previous trips had all been generally similar, go to a friend’s house where no parents were home and stay the night there, as he was my sober friend watching me. This time, I went to a friend’s house that I had been to many times before, but never to drop out. I was ready to fly high in the sky, or so I thought at least. We listened to some young jeezy, not what I would listen to while being high, and so I put on my headphones and listened to some calmer music. My setting and mindset were overall in poor states, as I was still recovering form my previous trip 4 months ago, and at someone’s house where I had never tripped.<br>
<br>
Within about 1 hour of my first dose, 20 minutes after taking the second dose, I began to feel something, a slight twinkle in my legs which told me that it was going to be some real acid. Within the next 10 minutes however, something all of the sudden happened. My body started to get warm, and I began to feel anxiety as the carpet right before me on the floor began to come alive. This is about where I realized that I shouldn't have as much as I did, little to late. Over the next 20 minutes after that, my heart started to beat fast and I simply told myself 'It's ok, just relax, I am going to be fine.' I then took my headphones off since I started to become confused at why I couldn't feel their presence in my ears anymore. I stood up and walked over to a counter and I began to trip.<br>
<br>
My heart started to beat harder, I breathed much deeper, and I became very warm. Now that the first dose was pretty much in full effect, I began to worry beyond belief. I grabbed the chair that I had been sitting in before, and I heard bullets being fired, I then ducked behind the chair then stood back up as the tracks of the bullets were frozen in mid-air. I then began to feel a change. The bullets turned in to Fighter Planes and they roared incredibly loud, flying straight into my stomach and chest, causing me to feel as if I had been hit. Now that I was experiencing some difficulty I brought it to my friends attention that I needed to go meet up with my other friends, two of them whom I had tripped many times before with, which was who I should have been with to begin with. As I was waiting about 15 minutes it had felt like, to go meet up with my other friends, I began to experience very strong synesthetic feelings. <br>
<br>
I looked over at the wall and it began to turn and twist as a whole, and as it turned, it became lit ablaze with very colorful fire. As this was happening, I began to hear echoes and these echoes became visible to me as patterns of what appeared to be faces which flew by me in waves. The most unbelievable thing happened next. To describe exactly what my vision becomes on a dose of LSD would be something like having a fish eyed view - stretched peripherals and a cartoon like world in front of me. I began to see and feel time turn into frames of life. I saw heat signatures of patterns enfolding right before my eyes, eventually making it impossible to make clear what I was really looking at in reality.<br>
<br>
I then began to slip away from my body, as I saw a body standing right in front of me for a brief second as it became engulfed in waves of lightning. This body turned around standing right in front of me, it was me, and no I was no where near a mirror at the time. I felt as if I had made a mistake, and many things began to happen, which had been reported by others who have also had a troubled experience, like mine, before. I frantically asked myself if I was going to be insane for the rest of my life, if I would ever be the same after this. The scariest thought I had was the question of 'Am I going to die? O my sweet mother of God my heart is going to stop on me,' as my heart was galloping from the adrenaline ridding through my body. I felt as if I had snorted a few grams of cocaine and then taken acid, since my previous trips were no where near this 'quick.' <br>
<br>
Now, I got into my friends car as he drove me to my destination. While driving along, I don't remember doing so, but I apparently bit into the seatbelt of his car telling him it tasted like chocolate..? While this was going on, I looked at the road as it began to wave and the trees began to sway and touch down on the road in front of me. It seemed as if everything was about 3 seconds behind in my head, as things weren't really processing visually as they should have...I wonder why. Eventually I arrived at my destination and ran out of the car faster than I have ever ran before, and I found my friends with about 12 other people sitting in a circle in a vacant lot between two houses, one of which my friend lives in.<br>
<br>
I simply fell onto the ground and my friends began to light a bowl up in front of me. While this was going on I prayed that God not kill me yet, for I was only 17 at the time, and if he would let me live I would never drop out again for the rest of my life. After this my friend lit the bowl in front of my face. As soon as I had hit the bowl, my trip changed, I finally calmed down. I began to sink into the ground through the grass, and all of the sudden, my throbbing head began to inflate and deflate in relation to how I was breathing. At one point I took the biggest breath I could and my head became a balloon hooked up to a helium tank. This was the beginning of my out-of-body experience.<br>
<br>
I held my breath and the sky became still, and I exhaled all of the air out of my body, and the Kaleidoscopic patterns began to soar very fluently. I saw many different objects crumble, re-shape and reappear in the sky, as these objects moved diagonally in the sky. I suddenly felt my head inflate and I heard a balloon inflate at the same time...weird. My head eventually detached from the rest of my body for brief periods of time. I was unable to speak coherently or perform any actions even close to being considered sane at the time. This part of the trip is hard to remember as it had now been 2:30 hours since my first dose. I was not even peaking on my second dose yet...<br>
<br>
The next few hours were very difficult to remember, as I am reporting this trip about 9 months afterwards. Eventually, we went back to my friend’s house and I began to see faces laughing and giggling on the walls as the walls would bend again and again. I then did the most stimulating thing I have ever experienced, video games. I played games at a speed that blew me and my friends out of the water. Everything became a speedy rush as if every moment of my life was being lived on a rollercoaster, stuck in a seat that I cannot leave, but full of energy.<br>
<br>
I eventually fell asleep at about 7am-730am and was still noticing some effects for the next couple hours (I had taken the first dose at about 7:15pm the day before). My pupils eventually receded and came to a normal size at about 11am that morning, I had a 16-hour body high. I survived a night that open my mind up and showed me that drugs were not the path I was wanting to do, and it has been a long time since taking any harder hallucinogens. I am doing 1000 times better now and feel great, ready to continue my life.<!--   End Body   -->

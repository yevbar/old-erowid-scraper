My first experience with crank was when I was 12 years old, I snuck into my fathers room and took a sniff of the odd white powedery substance in his drawer.  It wasn't much but I got a small head rush and became very hyper. <BR>
3 years later(now), I get high about 4-5 times a week, about every other month, normally by smoking unless I don't have the equipment then i'm forced to snort.  ACK!! right after snorting that 2 1/2' line your eyes fill with tears and your nose feels likes it is on fire.  Luckily this only lasts about 10-20 seconds depending on size and quality.  The burn is quickly followed by a extremely bitter flavor dripping down the back of your throat, which most people run for a pop to wash it away.  The instant rush lasts an extremely long time compared to coke. Normally about 3-6 hours, in that time you feel like you can do anything, normally there is a rush of sexual excitement when used.  There is also the feeling of being very energetic, like you can run faster, lift more and even talk more but feel little or no fatigue.  The worst part is the hunger but you dont want to eat. I always try to force down some food every time I get high, this makes it so your body wont be worn out the next day. MAKE SURE TO DRINK LOTS OF WATER as dehydration is VERY common.  To conclude these tips always try to get sleep, if you can't sleep lie in your bed and rest it works almost as well.<BR>
<BR>
Now, back to me.. I started to use every weekend with my friends, we were always looking for the best high possible from marijuana to LSD.  We all took a liking to Crank and LSD which we did whenever we could.  We started snorting Crank, then smoking (our favorite way) but then one of my friends started to shoot up which we all ended up trying.  Everyone liked it but me, it is the best high you can get from Crank but its very addictive.  My friends started to do anything for another slam from robbing people's houses to convenience stores.  In the end all 3 of my doper friends ended up in rehab 2 of them had broken necks from a car wreck on their way to get more Crank.  That left me. I am very happy that I have only main-lined one time and knew to stop instead of ending up like the rest.  IF YOU DONT WANT TO BE AN ADDICT DONT SHOOT UP!<BR>
<BR>
If you live in WA or OR states, meth should be fairly easy to come by either by use or just a way for fast money.  I recommend the usage as long as you can control it. a simple test is to get high in the day time around 2-3 and have one line left-over, if you do the line, you need to learn to control it, or get help, if you dont do it your fine:D.  If you are seeking the ultimate rush that lasts long, do Crank, if you want a quick rush that is 2x as good, but wont last as long, do one line of coke, then one line of crank.  The rush is better because you have the energy from the Crank, and the numbness and ambitions to get up and go from the coke. This way is also good because the crank covers up the quick comedown from cocaine because the crank is just gettin started ;).<BR>
<BR>
The worst mistake of a tweeker is to get caught in public, or arouse suspicions.  Before you start gettin spun and going out in the day more often, learn to control you speaking rate, and the constant looking around, grinding your teeth, and movement.  If possible be in a very very well lit place because in normal lighting when you are high your pupils are dilated almost covering the color of your eyes.<BR>
<BR>
Then this brings me to quality, you can't check quality by checking if its white or not, that is bullshit.  Crank is made from many chemicals and can be any different color.  You can either taste it, the stronger bitter taste the better, but if it leaves your mouth with a cool feeling it is most likely cut with epson salt.  But if its cut with a baby laxitive (which I cant remember the name of) you wont be able to tell by taste.  The other way is to burn it on aluminium foil, when burnt until the Crank is completely gone... If the crank left an odd colored residue like blue or a thick black film that can be scraped off, then its probly not very good, it should be a brownish residue that wont flake off.  Sometimes someone will say 'its pure crank!' or somthing like that... Dont listen to that there is no such thing as pure Crank, most of the stuff in it is under your kitchen sink.<BR>
<BR>
In all my experiences I have never had a drug that helped me do school work or just little things around the house, that is the reason most people use it, because it doesnt make you slow down like weed, it speeds you up so you get things done.  I fully recommend the use of methamphetamines to anyone that is looking for a rush, feeling of well-being, and more self-confidence.  But, some people do get addicted.  To avoid drowsy mornings drink lots of water, eat somthing, and attempt to sleep.<!--   End Body   -->

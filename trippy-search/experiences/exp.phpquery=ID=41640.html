I recently obtained some 4-Ho-DiPT and was very eager to try it. I’ve had a fair amount of experience with drugs. I’ve done weed, alcohol, shrooms, meth, speed (pills), coke, various opiates, Salvia, DXM, LSA, MDMA, 2C-I, and a few others.<BR>
<BR>
One night I arrived home from school at about 10:00 pm. I was in a pretty good mood; school had gone great (my grade became a B from a C that day) so I didn’t have any of the negative ‘vibes’ I normally have from school. I should also mention that the last time I ate was 5-6 hours before dosing.<BR>
<BR>
I had 30 mg of 4-Ho-DiPT to work with and planned on talking 20 mg and maybe taking the additional 10 mg if I felt like I could handle it. The half hour leading up to dosing was spent preparing the area and glimpsing over a few trip reports to see exactly how long it takes to kick in.<BR>
<BR>
10:30 pm - I ingested 20 mg spread onto a piece of peanut butter bread. This disguised the taste quite well.<BR>
<BR>
10:45 pm - I’m definitely feeling it. I feel very alert, and happy. +1, but quickly approaching a +2. I had a few hits of reefer at this point.<BR>
<BR>
11:00 pm - Over the last 15 minutes effects had slowly grown and now I was in a full +3 state. At this point I was almost peaking and felt fantastic. Amazing tactile sensations surpassing any drug I’ve ever done. It proved difficult to sit still, and so I paced back and forth a lot. The OEV’s were reminiscent of MDMA (ecstasy), only stronger. No real hallucinations yet, other than light related, although everything does have a very surreal look to it. I looked at my eyes and the black part filled my entire eye.<BR>
<BR>
11:15 pm - I decided I was up to taking 10 mg more, so I had 10 mg on another piece of bread. I tried closing my eyes and was greeted by some faint hallucinations. These visuals are hard to describe. I could see <i>something</i> moving around but could really tell what it was. It was very fascinating nonetheless, and I’d lose myself in the CEV world and snap back to reality. The first time I snapped back I was greeted by an amazing OEV. I looked up at my ceiling, which is textured, and it was flowing in small waves or currents like water. A few minutes later I snapped back again and stared at the ceiling, this time it was ‘breathing’ rather than flowing like water. I closed my eyes and opened them again and there was very little movement on the ceiling, just a slight distortion.<BR>
<BR>
11:30 pm - I explored my house a bit and stared out the window into the neighborhood. Looking across the street I thought I had seen lights turn off at their house, but I couldn’t be sure in this state. Right outside the window are two big trees, and I spent probably 5 - 10 minutes just staring at these trees. They somehow seemed ‘wise’, and seemed very majestic. They also moved around a bit. This very much reminded me of looking at trees while on shrooms. I decided to play guitar at this point, and found I was too jittery to play well, and gave up quickly.<BR>
<BR>
11:45 pm - 12:30 am - This time was spend wandering my house and also laying down with my eyes closed. I found myself having extremely bizarre thoughts, and my memory was horrible. I also had some minor paranoia where I felt like something was there, and would <i>see</i> things <i>behind</i> me. It was very strange. I’ve heard of this happening on acid, and was glad I finally experienced it. I was also having a constant inner dialogue with myself which I found very amusing and humorous. I don’t remember most of these thoughts I had, but do remember one: I was thinking about whether it’d be possible to sneak drugs into space if you were an astronaut. I got a picture in my mind of an astronaut strapped to chair for blast-off which drugs secretly hidden in his space suit. Then I got to thinking how it’d be impossible to do drugs with no gravity because they’d just float away. Then I realized you'd have to inject everything you take, so you can’t be an astronaut pothead. I had all sorts of similarly strange thoughts going on throughout the night. Also, my brain kept confusing what order to do things. This made doing simple things, like getting a cigarette and ashtray, very difficult. As a testament to this, the next day I found the peanut butter in the fridge and a can of Pepsi in the cupboard.<BR>
<BR>
Music. I just want to mention that at most points during this trip I was listening to music. The music euphoria was nice, and songs seemed amazingly good. I listened to mostly Hallucinogen, Shpongle, SYNsun, Pink Floyd, and Velvet Underground.<BR>
<BR>
12:30 am - 1:00 am - Decided to play a video game (Counter Strike to be precise). In this game you can talk to other people via microphone and I was cracking up laughing at things people said, which normally I wouldn’t find funny. It was hard playing with jittery hands, but enjoyable anyway.<BR>
<BR>
1:00 am - 1:30 am - I went out on my deck and smoked a couple cigarettes, and listened to some old Indian (the country) and Chinese music. Being outside with nature was a powerful feeling. Everything had beauty, despite it being very dark and winter time. I would love to try an outdoor trip in the woods on this drug. I think it’d be perfect for it.<BR>
<BR>
1:30 am - 2:30 am - Just laid down and closed my eyes and listened to some music, and smoked a bowl.<BR>
<BR>
2:30 am - 3:00 am - The drug is slowly wearing off, although I was still very messed up.<BR>
<BR>
By 3:30 am to 4:00 am the drug is pretty much completely worn off. I definitely feel some after effects, but nothing significant. I got a very mild headache at this point which went away after smoking some more ganja.<BR>
<BR>
This drug is definitely something I’d like to experiment further with. It was somewhat similar to shrooms, but also very different. If I had to compare it with drugs I’ve done I’d say it’s kinda like 2C-I and shrooms (not implying actually combining the two). This drug gave me the most powerful tactile sensations I’ve ever experiences, but at times it was overwhelming. It only became overwhelming when sitting still though (moving around made it fine). This is the only real negative aspect I noticed. All in all it was a great experience, and I’d do it again in a heartbeat, and I probably will.<!--   End Body   -->

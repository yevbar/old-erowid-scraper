<!--   Start Body   -->


First I want to start off with a little background.  I’m 19 years old and have been trying different types of drugs for three years but still mostly new to psychedelics/hallucinogenic.  I have tried cocaine, ecstasy, mushrooms, marijuana, and a lot of others that I feel are irrelevant.  This was the most intense experience that I have ever had in my and completely blew my mind.  I am writing this experience from a day after it happened.<br>
<br>
Preparation:<br>
<br>
This is for people like me who can’t seem to either hold down ayahuasca or be able to perform it correctly.  I had two failed previous experiences that were frustrating and I had only one dose left so I really wanted to get the most out of it.  I decided to go down to the local herbs store and purchased empty -00- capsules, I then took 24g’s of mimosa hostiles inner root bark, 3.5g’s of Syrian rue, and I ground them separately until they were both almost entirely powder.  After this I began the tedious task of stuffing the raw materials into the empty gelatin capsules.  Unless you have a machine that does it this is going to take you at least 1-2 hrs which is at least as long as it’s going to take you to brew ayahuasca.  When I finished I had about 74 capsules in total.  Six of them were Syrian rue and the others the mimosa.  I was kind of regretting having done it this because if you stand back and look at it, it gets a little overwhelming, at the same time you have the satisfaction of knowing your going to get that trip you have been searching for and that your kitchen skills cannot botch it.<br>
<br>
Trip day:<br>
<br>
I found out I was going to have the house to myself  for the better part of a Monday and decided this was going to be the best chance ill have to try it for a while so I jumped on the chance.  I woke up the next day and was really anticipating the experience to come, very positive mindset.<br>
<br>
10:40  I started by taking the 6-7 Syrian rue capsules. It feels nasty to swallow so many capsules and was not looking forward to the other 50+ to come later.<br>
<br>
11:20  I can tell the Syrian rue has kicked in because there are a lot of visual distortions and trails as well as time is going slow for me, so I decide to start the task of swallowing 4-5 pills at a time until all were finished.  I gagged a bit towards the end but I got it all done but it did take about 20-30 minutes to get them all down just because I was taking it slow and taking breaks.  I sat around for a little and my stomach started to turn so I smoked a joint of spice gold which effects me just like cannabis and it helped my stomach.  <br>
<br>
12:30  I got done smoking and petting/taking care of my dogs.  And had been watching TV and realized that the TV was bothering me and ruining things.  A strange body buzz was starting to increase to the point where it was stronger than any ecstasy doses I have ever done.  It caught me completely off guard and I knew I was going to pay for it.<br>
<br>
12:30-4:00  From here until I sober up I will break it up into stages as I feel it would be more appropriate, and I wouldn’t be able to remember and specific times<br>
<br>
Stage 1:  My body buzz has increased to the point where I feel like I’m getting hovering and the TV is tripping me out and everything in my peripheral vision looks like its moving/dancing but when I stare at it its normal.  I quickly run into my room and lay in the bed.  At this point I regretted doing this by myself because it was way to much to take in at once.  I turned on the TV in hopes it would keep me grounded into reality but instead it sounded like someone was playing a video in fast forward, when I heard this I quickly tried to check my pulse but it felt so fast that it was impossible without dieing and this is when my trip entered stage 2.<br>
<br>
Stage 2:  At this point I sincerely thought I was dieing.  At this time I was starting to have intense out of body experiences and would remember them for a little while.  It was as if I was being ripped back and forth between different planes of being conscious and different worlds.  It would come in waves.  After the first wave and I was back into my body and able to move, I ran around the house yelling its to much and oh my gosh over and over again, I also began to pray to god for guidance and help, at this point I still though I was dieing and then I had to throw up and was able to wash my face.  After this I moved on to stage 3.<br>
<br>
Stage 3  After my visit to the bathroom I was hallucinating intensely and realized I had to get to bed because I was going to have many more waves of intensity.  I was fighting it for a little while and kept checking the time.  I would go through and experience that felt like it lasted years and I would look at my phone and 2 minutes passed.  At this point it was so intense I thought I had finally died, upon the idea that I though I died I finally stopped fighting it and let it flow.  The waves were lasting for what felt like centuries.  Time was stopping for me and I started to actually be able think in these states and it was amazing.  <br>
<br>
My body felt like it never had felt in my entire life, I was weightless, cold or hot didn’t matter.  I remember a vision of just floating and being surrounded by white.  The unfortunate thing about dmt is I don’t remember a lot of the things I saw.  When I got used to having the obe it was easier to transition from one world to another.  So at this point I was still very much aware of my body, it seamed at some times I could have an obe and still feel the energy of my body but having a feeling of complete detachment.  This is where my final stage started.<br>
<br>
Stage 4:  Around this time I realized I wasn’t dead because the waves were becoming shorter.  I couldn’t help but to question what reality, time, and consciousness actually are and if they exist at all.  I felt as if I was being reborn and it was amazing.  I was coming down and had the most profound feeling of peacefulness and knew I would no longer fear death for as long as I live.  I would/could never be the same person again.  I was learning lessons of life and reality I wouldn’t be able to learn from people.  <br>
<br>
I was talking during my experience and even recorded a lot of this.   And finally around this time my trip had subsided and I was glad to be back to reality but also glad for the wonderful experience and with a whole new perspective on life and humanity.  It was very hard to endure this trip, it broke my reality apart and blew my mind but I also had the chance to experience bliss.  I think that capsuling the raw material is a good way to ingest it.  It of course eliminates the taste but I noticed that I had no nausea, I threw up only because I was afraid I was dieing/overdose.  The only negative is that swallowing tons of capsules is its nauseating in its own way.<br>
<br>
Now it’s the next day and the peacefully inner feeling is still with me.  I truly feel like I’ve been reborn, like I have a clean slate and get to redo my life from a new fresh perspective.  When people talk about having your third eye or minds eye opened I now understand what they mean.  If your thinking about doing this you had better use extreme caution, I felt at one point I had gone insane and this is what it was like.  Thanks for reading about my experience.<!--   End Body   -->

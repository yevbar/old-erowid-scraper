Background:<br>
I never expected that a herbal pill could give me one of the most intense, spiritual and euphoric experiences of my life - which is exactly what my first experience with LSA gave me. First off, a little history about me - I am a 25 year old male who ever since discovering alcohol when I was 14, have had a fascination with mind altering substances and the power they have to change our perceptions of life & reality. I am very experienced with marijuana (which is and always has been my favourite chill out drug) and was a daily toker for 7 or so years. I have also done magic mushrooms (once, and a very frightening trip that was!), MDMA, cocaine, various opiates, kratom (my new daily drug of choice), mephedrone, methylone and various other RC's.<br>
<br>
The trip:<br>
Prior to this experience, I had planned to do LSA for several weeks beforehand in the hope of gaining a different perspective on my life and to try and discover new reasons for my existence. I was at home in my bedroom on a lazy Saturday afternoon and the perfect opportunity for me to test out these new pills that I acquired a week earlier. My mindset was neutral. I decided to trip alone so I could fully focus on my thoughts and avoid distractions from other people. The pills were a blend of morning glory seeds, hawaiian baby woodrose and guarana - all blended together in gelatin capsules, in a blister pack of 10 pills. The packet advised to take 3 or 4 pills for a strong experience but I decided to take 5 of them on a completely empty stomach. I consumed the 5 pills at 12pm with a bottle of water and layed down on my bed watching tv for about 30 minutes eagerly awaiting for the trip to begin. Shortly after this, I realised I only had 2 cigarettes left so I had to walk to the shops to get another packet.<br>
<br>
On the way to the shops (T+1 hour at this point), I noticed subtle changes in my body - my legs became heavier and it felt like I had steel weights attached to my trainers, walking became more sluggish and my vision became fuzzier (similar to being stoned with that tunnel vision feeling). After reaching the shops and buying my cigarettes the effects started to intesify - walking required even more effort and I started seeing ripples in the pavement and buildings appeared to be breathing slightly. Then my stomach started to ache and a nauseous feeling swept over me, I began to get a bit anxious at this point as I still had a good 20 minutes to walk until I got home and was worried I might collapse because my body felt so heavy! Eventually I made it to my front door and the nausea was still increasing as well as the rippling effects of everything I looked at, so I dragged myself up to my bedroom and collapsed onto my bed.<br>
<br>
I knew that cannabis would help with the nausea so I rolled myself a nice fat joint of potent weed and after smoking it (T+90 mis), the high was very different to what I usually experience. At first I lay on my bed with intense stomach pains and diziness - feeling like I wanted all this too end and that these pills were a waste of money. However, about 20 minutes later the nausea started to gradually fade away and a warm euphoria started to grow - it began to build in my stomach and continued to spread outwards through my body, all the while gaining in intensity (it felt very similar to an mdma comeup but a lot slower and gradual). The best way I can describe it was like a small warm balloon of euphoria slowly inflating in my stomach until it spread throughout my whole body and finally to my mind. My bodyload decreased immensely, going from feeling like I weighed a 1000lbs to feeling as light as a feather.<br>
<br>
Then whack! I jumped off of my bed and this extremely intense feeling of pure bliss and peace swept through my whole being. If there was heaven on earth, this is exactly how I would imagine it to feel. I then started having racing thoughts about all the people I have in my life (from my past and present) and how much I truly love and value them, especially my parents. An amazing feeling of emapthy came over me and I had the feeling that we as human beings are all somehow connected to each other and deep down, we are all the same. I came to the realisation that happiness is inside each and everyone of us and it is up to to every person to find it, and that I would help everyone I know and love to reach this level of happiness I was experiencing.<br>
<br>
I then looked in my mirror to see how I looked in this magical state and my eyes were extremely dilated, pretty much all black! I saw myself very differently as well, like truly looking at myself for the first ever time. When I stared deep into my eyes I felt a strong love and empathy for myself, I started thinking about all the good deeds I've done over the years for people I love and then started to cry. I am a perfectionist and have been known to be very hard on myself if I don't handle a situation the 'right' way and doesn't live up to my expectations. These weren't tears of sadness though, more so tears of appreciation for being given the gift of life, for my existence and being able to experience this state of sheer euphoric bliss. I then vowed that I would stop being so hard on myself and that I'm only human like everyone else.<br>
<br>
Shortly after this I decided to celebrate my new found realisations by mixing on my decks, playing upbeat, funky euphoric house which continued to heighten my feelings of happiness and newly found love of life. While mixing, I danced like I've never danced before and every beat felt as though it was apart of me, traveling in and out of my body and everything just felt perfect. I was truly living in the moment. After about an hour or so of mixing (T+3.5 hours) I started to come down very gradually and the euphoria faded slowly. I still felt at great peace with myself and the world and decided to finish the journey off with another joint to ease myself back into the real world and think about what I had just experienced.<br>
<br>
In summary, LSA gave me a euphoric, legal & effective trip. It helped me out greatly in allowing me to find a new level of peace within myself and there was a positive afterglow for the next few days after the trip, I was in a very good mood and mindset for a good few weeks after the experience. If I do this again I will make sure to have some cannabis for the nausea because if I didn't smoke that first joint this may well have been a very different trip and I might have posted this in the bad trip section!<!--   End Body   -->

First of all this was about he most unpleasant thing I've ever done.  My wife and I split 30 grams of dried aminitas.  We ground them up in a coffie grinder and then heated them on the stove with water for about 45 minutes.  We started to drink them about 5:15 and finished about 5:25.  The taste was not apetizing at all.  My wife started to feel sick at about 5:45 and we both were getting light headed.  I got up to use the restroom and i felt like i was drunk; but only in my head.  For about the next 30 minutes we watched TV. andabout 6:20 I had to vomit.  We bot had a tottaly 'in the head' feeling.  The only thing I felt in my body was like i was being pushed into the couch.  When I closed my eyes I felt like I was falling.  My wife felt the same way.   About 6:30 I went outside because I was cold.  Even though it was 80 - 90 degreese outside I was still cold.  I found myself sweating profously, and salvating like my favorite dish was on the stove. <BR>
<BR>
After baout 30 minutes I went to lay on the couch.  I still felt the same.. in my head.  My wife looked like she was asleep so I didn't bother her.   I was still sweating really bad...but still cold.  So I got a blanket and tried to go to sleep. It didn't work.  The blanket made me sweat more, which made me colder' and so on.  For about the next three hours I felt this way.  Finally about 10:00 I started to feel normal.  So I got something to eat and when I diddnt feel anything anymore I was really tired so I was able to go to sleep.  Sleep came easy accept I kept waking up with a soaking wet pillow; and I dont ussually drool when I sleep.  The next morning i woke up and felt fine.  There were no after efects like LSD or anything.   As an ending note...neither of us will EVER take Aminitas again.<!--   End Body   -->

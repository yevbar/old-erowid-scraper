I have just really begun my psychonautic experiences lately, although I tried my first psychoactive over 5 years ago. I just discovered the power of the internet.  I am the type who favors psychedelics but usually at low doses.  My idea of a great night is a gram and a half of cubensis taken outdoors around sunset.  Although I've tripped over a hundred times I hate to trip hard, and just two grams of cubensis primordia once sent me to a place I'd rather not go again.  But anyway...to the point.<BR>
<BR>
I ran into a pretty good supply of 5-MeO-DMT about three weeks ago and have since smoked it about 5 times and this report describes my second attempt at insufflation.  I should first say that I have a very low tolerance for psychoactives of all kinds. (see above)  My first experiences with smoking 5-MeO-DMT kind of turned me off as the nausea I felt ruined it, as well as the intensity of the come on.  Even just .5 mg still hurt my gut.<BR>
<BR>
But before throwing the shit away and giving up, i thought i'd try snorting it.  I'd heard this route gives more of a psilocybin-like high.  So I did.  First time I took it too easy since I needed less when smoked than others I've read about.  I took 1mg and nothing happened so I took another 3 mg.  This led to only minor changes that quickly wore off.  I should note that it does burn.  A lot.<BR>
<BR>
However, two nights ago I succeeded in finding the nature of this substance.  My girlfriend had said she wanted to try snorting after I told her it was a lot friendlier this way as opposed to smoking.  I found my preweighed stash of individual, varying doses and grabbed two that said 4.  We cut it up and snorted.  Three minutes later it hit.  It was a pleasant, reasonably paced come on.  My partner, however seemed to be overwhelmed.  We went into the bedroom and plopped ourselves down to study the intricacies of the ceiling.  I also was far from sober, but was completely enjoying the effects.  It was somewhat reminiscent of acid (although I haven't touched that for 5 years) with just a hint of visual disturbance.  I reached my peak after about 10 minutes while I assured my girl that it would be gone soon.  Thankfully it wasn't though, not completely.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway...just after the peak the two of us started to do some touching.  I found my way to the nether-regions and it felt so good, that all i could think about was my first awkward sexual experiences.  Eventually we got naked, and I swear it was like I had never been naked with a girl before.  This sex was so incredible I had to stop myself from bursting out laughing I felt so good.  It truly was much better than my first 10 orgasms.  And everybody remembers how good those were.  After what was a really long time spent fucking, we both looked at each other and exchanged ideas about what just happened.  'That was fucking awesome, amazing, etc.'<BR>
<BR>
It was like I just lost my virginity.  Wish that would have been as good as this was.  <BR>
<BR>
5-MeO-DMT is definitely worth a try as an aphrodisiac.  Wait until just after the peak (so you have a chance at concentrating).  Get naked.  You won't be let down.<BR>
<BR>
Down with scheduling.<!--   End Body   -->

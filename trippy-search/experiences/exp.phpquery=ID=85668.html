I had heard about MDAI (through a passing mention online) that it was a potential non-neurotoxic alternative to MDMA. I managed to acquire 1g of this substance, a brown powder with the appearance of coca powder.<br>
<br>
Doing a great deal of research online, I expected it would have some similarities to MDMA, without the 'speedyness' or euphoria.<br>
<br>
On an evening with nothing else on the table, I suggested to my husband that we try it. I had decided on a dosage of 200mg for our first time, based on reading reports online that described that lower dosages were not rewarding.<br>
<br>
Within 15 minutes of ingesting my dose orally (powder weighed and then packed into a gelcap), I began to feel a happy come-up anxiety along with a mood lift.<br>
<br>
The high was quite pleasant. I felt the same familiar and 'soft' body load I was used to with MDMA. I felt significant mood lift, though not euphoric. My mood was not forced to be any particular thing, and would go up and down throughout the experience.<br>
<br>
Sitting and just being was easy. While I felt like I was in a new skin that allowed all sensory input to be quite pleasurable, I did not feel an urgent need to take any actions.<br>
<br>
While on MDMA, the feeling that everything in my head and heart must be said is overwhelming, I did not feel such urgency on MDAI. I did talk freely and honestly, and I felt that a new level of clarity was brought to my thinking about my relationship.<br>
<br>
I felt highly relaxed, and almost sleepy at times. The effects were quite noticeable, but none of it was unpleasant for me.<br>
<br>
The total time for this experience was approximately 4 hours. There was no crash or unpleasant comedown, just a feeling of slowly returning to baseline. I had no trouble sleeping after I came down. I would certainly ingest this substance again.<!--   End Body   -->

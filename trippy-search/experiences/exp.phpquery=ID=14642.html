The reason I am writing this is because back in Febuary 2002 I<BR>
decided to experiement with Morning Glory seeds. I accidentally<BR>
came upon this website and actually researched the seeds before<BR>
trying them. You guys gave me so much good information that I<BR>
decided I should give back.<BR>
<BR>
Here's how it all happened for me. On 1 afternoon I went up to<BR>
the local K-Mart to look for MG:HB seeds. While in there I found<BR>
Martha Stewart brand MG:HB seeds. I proceeded to buy 4 packs<BR>
(6grams, roughly 240 seeds). Then I came home and prepared the<BR>
seeds. I washed them with dish washer soap, then dryed them on a<BR>
paper towel, then ground them up in a coffee grinder.<BR>
<BR>
At 9pm I poured the seeds into a cup of water. Then drank the<BR>
potion and ate the remaining chunks of seeds. It was pretty<BR>
nasty but definetly wasn't that bad. At about 20 minutes the<BR>
effects started to kick in. But these were mild effects. Also<BR>
though, my stomach started to hurt and my limbs became very<BR>
heavy. So i drank some pepto to help my stomach. At about 1 hour<BR>
the effects really started to kick. And once the trip began to<BR>
take over all stomach pain just left. At 1st I began to think of<BR>
it as just a mild acid trip, which I was happy with. It wasn't<BR>
untill about 2 or 3 hours into it that the MG trip REALLY began<BR>
to kick hard. Then it felt exactly like an acid trip. Walls were<BR>
rolling and breathing. When i walked around the house the floor<BR>
began to slant. It felt like the world was tilted. Once I turned<BR>
the kitchen light on I was very light senstive. It felt as if<BR>
everything was glowing around me. Best way to describe it is,<BR>
imagine walking out into the street in the middle of the night,<BR>
standing directly under a street light, you can feel the light <BR>
beaming down on you. Honestly, the peak lasted from about 11pm<BR>
to 5am. It was very intense and lasted for a very long time. and<BR>
i mean peaking, I'm not counting the 'afterglow', which as<BR>
everyone knows goes on for many hours after the peak is gone.<BR>
<BR>
In conclusion, I highly recommend it, it was fantastic. I've<BR>
read many negative reports on here, and I've come to many<BR>
conclusions. Maybe they had to low a dosage, got bad seeds, or<BR>
weakened the seeds during the extraction process. My advice,<BR>
get at least 6grams, clean them, dry them, grind them, drink<BR>
them. And don't forget the pepto.<!--   End Body   -->

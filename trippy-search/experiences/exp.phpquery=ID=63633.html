So I recently came down with a temporary (but quite painful) medical condition and got a prescription for Vicodin.  Vicodin never really did it for me so I asked my Mom if she had any other painkillers that would help.  She came over like 30 mins later with a whole bag of goodies.  She brought me one container half full of liquid Dilaudid, 10 2mg Dilaudid pills, 10 10mg Flexeril pills, and 5 20mg Percocet.  During the next couple days, I tried each one (for the pain) and found the flexeril to be the most calming and euphoria-enducing.  The other pills all made me trip more than relax, and I liked that about the flexeril. <br>
<br>
Anyway, this weekend I decided I was gonna try some flexeril mixed with some other drugs at a party.  My mindset at the time was excited about the graduation party I was going to and energetic.  I also drank an energy drink about an hour before the party.  I got to the party at 9:30 so I'll begin there.<br>
<br>
I immediately popped two flexeril and chased it down with a beer.  I waited 'till about 10:15 and, still not feeling the effects of the first two pills or the beer, took two more flexeril and drank my third beer.  At this time me and two friends went into one of the houses bedrooms and rolled a joint.  The three of us split it and played video games for a while.  This is when I felt the flexeril hit.  It came on slow at first, as I started feeling very relaxed and comfortable on the edge of the bed.  The colors on the T.V. screen were blurring together and sort of melting into each other.<br>
<br>
We finished the joint at about 11:00 and got up to get back to the party.  It was so hard for me to stand up, as I was so freaking comfortable sitting there.  I felt very heavy and it was kinda hard to move, but not impossible by any means.  My whole body was kinda tingling numb.  We walked into the kitchen, where we stood and I drank maybe 3 more beers.<br>
<br>
At this point, it was about 11:50 and the room was starting to move around me.  I knew I was well on my way to drunk, so I contribute that feeling to the beer mostly.  There was, however, another feeling that I can't contribute to the alcohol.  I was standing there with a friend on either side of me in the dining room, facing toward the kitchen.  All at once, the kitchen and all the people and stuff in it seemed to increase in elevation by about 4 feet.  It was like someone had lifted up one side of the house and tilted it to a 5% grade.  It was very hard to stand up straight and I found myself holding onto my friends to stand up straight.<br>
<br>
We went outside to get some fresh air.  My friends started asking me if I was o.k. and they said I looked weird.  I told them I had taken some pills and they were kinda mad, but then started asking me if they could have some too lol.  I gave a friend 2 of my Oxy's and gave another friend two of my prescribed vicodin's.  I took one more flexeril with them and drank 2 more beers.<br>
<br>
We went back inside around 1:00 and almost everyone was already asleep (there were about 20-25 people there).  There were still a few people watching T.V. in the living room so I made my way over there.  It was then that I realized how hard the pills had hit me.  It was so hard to walk from the front door through the front room and the hallway and into the living room.  It was maybe 40 feet but it felt like 40 miles.  Visually, everything was a little blurry.  I kept thinking like my eyes were like a video camera and I was taping the party, only I was recording everything like a half a frame slow.  Like if someone moved really fast, I could see like a half a frame of their arm, like a trail.  Wow this is harder to explain than I thought it would be!  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I sat on the couch and drank another beer and just enjoyed the high.  I was very relaxed but not tired, very happy but not energetic, and overall just felt like all my friends were so cool and everything was just perfect.  I sat there on the couch for maybe an hour or so and then fell asleep.  I woke up the next morning at about 9:30 hangover free.  After returning home, however, I became very very tired.  I slept for a solid 8 hours and awoke feeling refreshed.  I guess thats the flexeril hangover people talk about.<br>
<br>
Overall it was a very good experience.  I would definitely do it again if I could convince my Mom to give me some more of her pills hehe.  I've heard people say (my Mom included) that flexeril makes them prone to being excited or scared or agitated from small disturbances.  Like one time my Mom was sleeping in her bed, doped up on about 4 flexeril, and I opened the door and entered her room quickly and without warning.  She practically hit the ceiling.  The jumped up out of bed and started cussing at me and her heart was beating like crazy.  Well, I didn't feel any of those disturbing feelings when I was on it.  At one point during this night a fight went down between two guys I didn't really know.  Not only did I not get extra-excited, as you would think, I didn't even get as exicted as I would have if I was sober.  I kinda just stood there and enjoyed the fight hehe.  At first I was worried about mixing the pills with alcohol, but I saw no ill effects from this combination at all.<!--   End Body   -->

I've tried morning glory seeds using all the extraction methods listed on errowid and none of my trips was as strong nor as awesome as my last one.<BR>
<BR>
I bought 6 packets of heavenly blue seeds. They had a 'do not eat' warning on the package, so rinsed them in soapy water for a few minutes and then dried them. I put them into a coffee grinder, but gave up grinding the buggers about half way through. I then ate the whole seeds, taking care to munch them as long as possible. The taste was not that bad. I then waited about 30 minutes and ate the rest that I had grinded into yougurt.<BR>
<BR>
I took a 40 minute walk into a park and forest. By the time I got there, the effects were starting to come on. I got a sick feeling and though I never puked, I had a lot of phlegm. After sitting with my head between my knees for 5 minutes, i lit a joint. Then I began to feel like God. Nature was speaking to me, the trees caused me to have laughing fits. I was running through the forest from tree to tree pretending to be rambo or a hunter or something. I was quite sane, but just felt like being a child again. I did this for about 4 hours and then went home. Once home, I became very creative, wrote some poetry, came up with an idea and was so convinced that the only person who would understand it would be Bill Gates. In fact I was certain that everything else in my life including work would have to wait until I had met with Bill. <BR>
<BR>
I went to sleep with that thought and slept well. I can remember having many dreams. When I awoke, I did feel rather silly about the Bill Gates thing, but I had a whole collection of photos that I had taken of myself in the forest with my digital camera. overall, it was the most fun I have ever had by myself.<BR>
<BR>
Eating the seeds direct is the best way to go with Morning glory. I'll definately be doing this again next weekend. The dosage also seemed to be perfect.<!--   End Body   -->

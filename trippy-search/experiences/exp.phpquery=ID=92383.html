I was interested in this drug for relieving the tiredness of jet-lag when crossing 8 or more time zones, which I do a lot for work. I work in medicine so know my pharmacology and physiology and thought Provigil would be a good try. I got it on prescription through a high street pharmacy not online so this was the real thing for sure. <br>
<br>
I took it on a day off, before I had to travel, to try it out, at 8am.  Very gradual start - It took about 2-3 hours to start to feel the effects, nothing sudden. Negative effects were minimal - I had a few short palpitations and my heart rate went up slightly at rest.  But no headache or other physical reactions. At best I felt like I'd had too much caffeine but along with that was a mild sense of detachment. It didn't make me feel any more alert, focused, clear-headed or otherwise more productive. To be honest, it reminded me of a mild form of the experience of taking MDMA prior to the good feelings kicking in: a bit agitated, slightly intense, but all at a low level. At times it felt like the day after taking MDMA, a bit slow and limited multi-tasking ability! <br>
<br>
There's nothing recreational or fun about Provigil, nothing at all. The product research shows that about 70-80% of people reported improvements in alertness and functioning. I think I'm probably in the 20% for whom it doesn't do that.  I'd read a lot about it really helping fatigue and concentration but it definitely didn't do much for me. I thought about increasing the dose but there was nothing about the experience that made me want more of it. It took 12 hours at least to noticeably wear off. I'm normally quite focussed and high energy in myself so I wonder if it doesn't add much if you're already that way inclined.  That was 160$ I could've spent elsewhere !<!--   End Body   -->

inhaled<BR>
waited.<BR>
<BR>
how much time had pass?<BR>
<BR>
HOLYFUCKINGCHRISTALMGIHTYDONTPULLMETHATFAST!<BR>
screaming fury<BR>
a roar all around<BR>
<BR>
got me a moving; ohhohoho<BR>
o man; here we gogogogo go<BR>
<BR>
-hold on little one<BR>
     lead me sally<BR>
-that i will<BR>
<BR>
the field of vision; dark<BR>
twenty seconds..<BR>
errupting color<BR>
the emptyness, <BR>
sparkeles to life<BR>
vibrant fucking life<BR>
<BR>
tunnels; tunnels errupting everywhere<BR>
intertwining vines;<BR>
mirror images; <BR>
so many vines?<BR>
so many patterns...<BR>
they shoot back, back into infinity<BR>
   these numbers know no bounderies...<BR>
they hold no limits<BR>
that i see; which i have sought<BR>
   there the bending tree<BR>
times; howmany times?  it etched backwards<BR>
this bending tree; <BR>
fire; ablaze in glory<BR>
greens; strange hues; strange sensations...<BR>
<BR>
voices all around; whispers of here and there<BR>
discussing the anywho's<BR>
the what nots of life<BR>
<BR>
patterns; decending upon me<BR>
at terriable speed and unstopable furry<BR>
 the end of the tunnel<BR>
    breakthrough..<BR>
<BR>
hyperspace.<BR>
<BR>
   ITS BREEDING?!<BR>
HOLY JESUS im feeding it <BR>
     no use stopping<BR>
   no one can stop it<BR>
<BR>
'you cant stop me you cant stop me you cant stop me'<BR>
I dont want to<BR>
'follow me follow me follow me'<BR>
        down the winding winding path<BR>
<BR>
what is this that i see?<BR>
strange reality; <BR>
purple; colors; entities have come<BR>
I float through a field <BR>
strange vibes<BR>
strange glows<BR>
time; its as existant as a one dimentional object<BR>
<BR>
ahah ; there we  have it; two sides of the circle; a floating syphony of elves <BR>
and throbbing orbs<BR>
<BR>
still I ascend to heights<BR>
I had no intention of reaching<BR>
an all to familiar sensation..<BR>
splicing<BR>
<BR>
my feet; miles away<BR>
me torso; segmented beyond belief<BR>
cakleling laughter: YOU CANT STOP IT<BR>
  no; your right; I cant stop it<BR>
I merely hold on<BR>
this hurricane of exotic chemicals<BR>
unleashed upon my head;<BR>
<BR>
how long has it been?<BR>
that concept has merely faded<BR>
<BR>
then the true contacct was made;<BR>
the one that i was ment to see<BR>
the thing i was ment to behold<BR>
I had come<BR>
the pullsing edge of DMT hyperspace<BR>
so near; the vaulting speed of lady ska<BR>
so strong.<BR>
pushing; pushing<BR>
if i was already in hyperspace?<BR>
where was this place i was going to?<BR>
<BR>
memory fades...<BR>
there is no level<BR>
no single analogy<BR>
that will ever mark; that will ever come close to<BR>
retelling this lizard Kingdome<BR>
this Kingdome come; <BR>
this realm of two worlds<BR>
<BR>
fabric; the fabric tears<BR>
sickening shudders<BR>
violent shakes<BR>
tunnels; i continue down more and more<BR>
elves; fucking elves<BR>
they cant keep their fucking pants on<BR>
erotic fucks...<BR>
   I love it<BR>
<BR>
merging with space<BR>
no refriderators...<BR>
this is <BR>
far more...<BR>
galactic proportions<BR>
cosmic visions<BR>
<BR>
before me stands a temple<BR>
infinitely high<BR>
infinitely large<BR>
climbing up it<BR>
lizards; of varying color<BR>
I travel around it; warping<BR>
pulsating beats<BR>
are those drums I hear?<BR>
<BR>
   BOOMSHAKLAKA MOTHERFUCKER NO TURNING BACK<BR>
conversations<BR>
misty conversations; sweep upon me; sweet familiarity<BR>
fearful alieniess<BR>
is that a word?<BR>
what is a word?<BR>
logos?<BR>
what are those?<BR>
Christ; spinning and spinning<BR>
<BR>
colors.<BR>
<BR>
vibrant colors<BR>
<BR>
odd de ja vu<BR>
familiarity<BR>
I am meeting an old friend; how about some tea?<BR>
no tea tonight<BR>
no rest for those who test the limits<BR>
what are the limits?<BR>
the end; ahaha; no concept of an end<BR>
circling this ancient structure<BR>
I am content on <BR>
simply completing my orbit; round<BR>
and round the merrygoround<BR>
then we all fall down.<BR>
down?<BR>
<BR>
viscious speed<BR>
<BR>
decending into the structure<BR>
throbbing masses<BR>
entangled patterns<BR>
I see Mayan symbols<BR>
cosmically huge patterns<BR>
they rotate<BR>
to my left a smelve (smelve?  aha; he is built of DMT likes; ska personality; freindly; benignly watching me)<BR>
he points<BR>
I look<BR>
the patterns before my field of vision<BR>
 begin to extend backwards<BR>
and backwards<BR>
mirror images<BR>
then a kaleidoscope of colors<BR>
rotating inwards<BR>
jumping glee<BR>
euphoria.<BR>
<BR>
then it turns.<BR>
jesus fuck; how long has it been?!<BR>
lady ska departs; slowly; notcibly<BR>
familiar DMT patterns<BR>
familiar DMT entities<BR>
a purple room; I stare through tinted glass<BR>
inside are desks with knobs<BR>
and things i dont remember<BR>
mirror images extend backwards....<BR>
<BR>
how long has it been!?!?!?!??!!?<BR>
<BR>
blackout<BR>
<BR>
why do we throw it all away?<BR>
<BR>
Conclusion:<BR>
I blacked out after 10 minutes according to my sitter.<BR>
The Salvia never left; the point where I begin to feel as though its presence is leaving is marked by the arrival of a Level Six in combination with a truly magnificent dosage of DMT.  I simply forgot I was on drugs.  Therefore I merged with the high and accepted it as my eternal state of mind.<BR>
<BR>
This trip did not teach me anything; it did not open up any new insights into life.  What it did was take my mind so far past the limits to places never before imagined.  This was a psychic journey in a literal sense.  I wasn't out to find any answers; I was merely an explorer.  And that is exactly what I did.<BR>
<BR>
Unimaginably intense.<BR>
<BR>
The trip itself rivaled that of le Belladonna.<!--   End Body   -->

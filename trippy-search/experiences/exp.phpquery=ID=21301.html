I like to be creative. I like to explore new ideas. I also make really good food, because i like to cook. I have desided to be more creative with my drug exploration, and fixed myself a damn fine cocktail.<br>
<br>
T 0:00 Ate one hash brownie. tasted good! i haven't eaten for 24 hours, and i've been preloading on 5-HTP and multivitamine for two weeks now. my friends also ate some brownies, (There are 5 of us) and right after took their MDMA capsules, with 140mg each.<br>
<br>
T 0:50 Brwonie starts to kick in. smoke some bowls. my friends are starting to roll.<br>
<br>
T 1:00 ok, its time to fix the cocktail. i take 70mg from the 140mg of MDMA, dissolve in oj and drink. i cut the remaining 70mg into two lines. i take about half an inch of cocaine and mix it in one line. then i take 10mg of 2C-B and mix it with the second line. sprinkl some heroin on top, just a bit to make things more smooth, about 10mg on each line, and in goes one line, in goes the other.  after a few seconds the cocaine and heroin starts to kick in beautifully. euphoria is coloring my world, and its been a long long time since i felt so good about myself.<br>
<br>
T 1:20 my friends all roll like crazy to the psychodelic music that washes over the room, AND IM HAVING FUN! i walk around, gaze at all the hidden beauty of things that was burning all around me. my thoughts were blade sharp and lightning fast. i felt so united with myself and my life. MDMA is kicking in along with the cocaine, THC and heroin. <br>
<br>
T 1:40 peaking on the snored MDMA, while the swallowed one starts to work as well. Oh my god this came out exactly as good as i imagined, and in any minute will burst the border of expectations wich i could afford myself. the hash is making things less edgy, more relaxed and fluidly like (not as a visual, but as a general feeling of thoughts and emotions), the heroin+cocaine combination (also known as a speedball) is absolutly wonderful along with the MDMA bright energy and empathy.<br>
<br>
T 2:00 While trying to come up with some sort of a name to this cocktail, i've noticed that all the shadows in the room seemed to somehow look at me, as if in antisipation to what can i come up with. i smiled. 'hello amigos!' i said to them through my mind. they seemed happy, like my dog that never gets bord of exciting whenever im around:) he died last week. i though about it, and all of a sudden everything turned horrible. i emidietly felt a bite of pain pinching my heart, that fastly grew to a blinding sence of pain. oh the horrible pain... just kidding! i was having a blast! my dog seems to sence whenever he comes up in my trip, and he came down from the second floor to show his enthusiastic.<br>
<br>
T 2:20 HOLY SHIT! just smoked a bowl of good weed and tabacco, and the nicotine rush blew me away! (i quite smoking 6 months ago, and i sure missed that drug) the THC high hits me like 10 megatone train. the synergy between all the drugs is blooming with magic. colors starts to shine and drip all over the place. the 2C-B chemical feeling is well noticed, but does not bother me at all. i feel like my brain has being colored from the inside. this experience is totally positive in force! i enjoy the aural hallucination. i usually get a lot more then others (im a musician). the music is amazing! i start to think about the music as an other form of color, and about color as a different version of music. thought and inspirations flud me, and slowly (whan could have been a lot faster then it felt) the music was transforming it self into color before my very eyes, and color was some how 'heard' insted of 'looked'. i laughed histericly!<br>
<br>
from this time on i can only guess the time.<br>
<br>
T 3:00 my feelings and thoughts melt into one another. my sences blend in, it was sort of hard to tell wether the music is on or off sometimes, because i confuse 'hearing' with 'seeing', for two of them were colored in the same colors. the feeling of having a body tended to drift away from me into the couch, into the floor, or into thin air. color is fluding the room. i close my eyes, and a huge exploding flow of shapes and flashes of liquid color run before my very eyes. what a bliss<br>
<br>
T 5:00 things are easing down a bit now, and im getting the feeling of 'slowmotion orgasm' that I get after an MDMA peak. this combination seemed to double or even triple the strength, depth and duration of each drug. we make some coffee (i really like coffee) and smoke some bowls, wich makes everything kick back right in.<br>
<br>
T 7:00 took some multivitamine and some 5-HTP. i feel very relaxed now. i was probably tierd if i was alone, and getting a bit exhausted with tripping, but thanx to my friends the fire keeps on going, and i feel energized to sink into deep convirsasions with them.<br>
<br>
T 9:00 taking a walk outside to buy some cigarrets. walking is so relaxing. i feel like i can walk forever. i wish i took my cd player with me.<br>
<br>
it took about another 12 hours get completly baseline again. in the following days i kept taking multivitamine and 5-HTP. i had no dipression, just a sligh 'alterness' that remains for several days everytime i trip.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, this was a fine fine cocktail. i've already come up with more cocktail ideas, such as low dose of mushrooms, a bit wine, a bit MDMA, and going into a healing center (you know, group sessions of sitting in sircles, druming and chasing away the negative energies. that sourt of things). i almost never take a drug by itself, i like to combine drugs and play with the effect. my first trip was a cocktail. i enjoy to be creative.<br>
<br>
peace. (ALE YAROK!)<!--   End Body   -->

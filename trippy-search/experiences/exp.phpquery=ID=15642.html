Hi, all! I thought I'd share my first experience of smoking Wild Dagga. <BR>
<BR>
The package arrived in the mail this morning, and though I was exhausted from having worked the night before, the sound of the postman knocking at the door woke me, and I was unable to get back to sleep. 'Ok, let's see what this stuff is all about...' <BR>
<BR>
I'd read the reports on this substance on this site, and was sufficiently curiosified (wow, new word) into ordering it online. As I measured out 1 gram of the very fluffy mixture (-shredded leaf and flower material; Looks like something you might find in a pillow), I noted the rather icky, weedy smell, and wondered if it really might be as disgusting a smoke as others on here had said it was...<BR>
<BR>
I stuffed the puffy stuff into my little, grey marble pipe, shoved it in tight, and lit it, inhaling a rather tentative first hit...<BR>
<BR>
To quote a previous poster: 'BLARGGH!'. This plant is, indeed, quite gross. I did begin to notice some mild effects, however, as I struggled through the 1st bowl, and after downing a couple of glasses of wine (to distract from the taste), I packed and smoked a second bowl with the remaining 1/2 gram. <BR>
<BR>
Allow me to clarify: I am definitely not a 'psychonaut'; My experiences have been limited to the rare joint of grass and the odd bit of hash (Ahhhhh!) in my teens. I never wanted to risk acid or anything else, due to a lifelong tendency towards  anxiety, which, even on hash, sometimes resulted in hallucinations. I could just imagine what heavier drugs would do to me..!<BR>
<BR>
It is only in recent months that I've felt like gettng high once again. Enter 'psychotropic herbs', which I discovered when I actually read a 'junk' email message (which I normally never do). I then waded through tons of reports on Erowid's excellent site, discovered an online supplier, bought a pipe and scale, and some Wild Dagga (and Salvia for a different kind of trip), and voila: All set for an experience. <BR>
<BR>
Too bad I didn't have one. In smoking 2 bowls of Wild Dagga, all I noticed was profuse drooling/spitting (about 1/2 cup's worth - Yum!), a sloppily relaxed mouth (re: stupid grin), the occasional wave of slight giddiness, which would pass quickly, a 'floppy' upper body sensation, and mild dizziness. <BR>
<BR>
Menthol cigarettes came in handy for this forray; The minty smoke helped soothe the burning-throat sensation I'd quickly acquired. After the 2nd bowl of Dagga, I'd had enough, and was pretty nauseated at the idea of smoking any more of it then...<BR>
<BR>
While the stuff does have a smell/taste that is a bit reminiscent of grass, it's effects are much, MUCH less potent, if you're hoping to compare the two at all. However, I'm going to continue experimenting with it, since I still want to get high, and prefer to do it without risking charges... ;p <BR>
<BR>
I've heard I might be able to make a hash oil out of it - Definitely an idea; Anything that might taste and work better that this did!<!--   End Body   -->

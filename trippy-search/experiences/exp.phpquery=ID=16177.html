<B>[EROWID NOTE: 5-MeO-AMT is an extremely potent compound, active at just a few milligrams.  Experimenting with unknown dosages is reckless and stupid.  While there is no such thing as 'safe use' of any drug, the use of a milligram scale with this compound is extremely nessessary.]</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So, Someone tells me about a place where I can order 5-MEO-AMT. I wasn't completely sure what it was, or what it did. In the past I've tried 5-meo-dmt, acid, dxm, dramamine, ecstasy, and weed. None of those touch this drug. After reading up on the drug, it was said to be like ecstasy and acid, just a lot stronger. I was very curious since I loved those drugs the most. I order the drug and receive 1000mg's of it.<BR>
<BR>
I've tried this 3 times since I got it, all at different dosages(I didn't have anything to measure how much I had, so I had to eye it) The first time I think I might have overdosed. Here's what happend<BR>
<BR>
I got the drug in the mail, at 2 I took a small dosage(again I can't be sure how much I took) at 5 it didn't kick in so I decided to goto my friends house. He was also interested in doing it so we both did another dose, and put it in a capsule and swallowed. An hour later we feel it a little bit, my friend feels it a little bit more than me, this annoys me and I wanted to take another dose, but didn't. 10 Minutes later - My vision little by little gets hazier and hazier, at last, the strong hallucinations. I look at the suspended ceiling with those block patters. The entire ceiling vibrated and shook, like it was being distorted. Another 10 minutes passed ( I think ) and I become extremely sick, it snuck right up on me and I puked about 5 times. All liquid (I didnt eat anything that day) When closing my eyes I could see when puke was coming up, as best as I can explain it, the black got blacker when keeping my eyes shut.<BR>
<BR>
I also felt like I had to fart (which was an incorrect assumption!) I hurried to the bathroom and took a nice shit. We then turned some music on, the music was awesome, but the weird thing was I got bored of every song about 5 minutes into it. I stayed on the bed looking at the ceiling, and the shades, and how the strings made copies of themselves when I moved them. I could move my hands all over the place and see trails everywhere. I went outside and looked at the cars going by, it was dark out so I only seen a gel looking trail in back of them. After my friends girlfriend came over we went to Wal-Mart and my god was I paranoid. My friend was having the time of his life buying fruit and talking to people. I was looking at everyone and looking at their expressions, some people laughed at us, and some people talked about totally unrelated things - I assumed they were talking about us and when they got close they changed the subject immediately. Walmart was so shiney and bright, I looked in the entertainment section and TRIED playing the nintendo game cube. For the life of me I couldn't get it to play. People were still walking around(with that same stock guy with the radio laughing) This made me very paranoid. Although I didn't care much. I then seen my boss' brother. which freaked me the fuck out. So we left. Driving in the car was like speed lightning fast, specially with a 12' sub in the back!  (or maybe we were just going speed lightning fast)<BR>
<BR>
---I will also add that the beginning of the trip I felt like jumping out of my skin( Almost like dramamine - only not the sick feeling )---<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The second time I tried it I was alone. This was a bad idea. I had no interest in the computer at all. My brain felt tired and fried, and for the life of me could not sleep. This is not a party drug at all, its a get together with a friend and have fun. <BR>
<BR>
It may be a nice drug alone if you do it in low dosages.<BR>
<BR>
The third time was with a friend - And I had weed this time. WOW does it help or what, no puking at all, and a nice smooth trip. I loved it.<!--   End Body   -->

I have heard much about Ketamine and its effects, but this past week I have had two bad experiences.  Both settings were my apartment.<BR>
<BR>
The first time I tried K was late one night after work.  A trusted friend had tried the stuff we bought on a previous occasion and reported to have seen many visuals (which, of course, is always fun). After purchasing two pouches of this substance (purportedly three lines apiece), a friend and I snorted ~1.5 lines.  It smelled like the slime you got out of machines when you were a kid except in a powder form.  I then smoked a joint with another friend while the other snorter sat out.  After approximately 15 minutes, my friend was feeling something.  I felt off baseline but not altered in any serious way.  Perhaps this is because I am an experience drug user, but I did not see any references on Erowid in this regard.  After at least 45 minutes, my friend was 'fucked up', and I was ready to go to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
The next time I decided to try the entire pouch myself.  After snorting the entire 3 lines, I put on some music for meditation.  At this point, I had read James Kent’s <A HREF="../chemicals/ketamine/references/other/1997_kent_resproject_1.html">Metaprogramming From Within the Eye of the Storm</A>, and was somewhat anxious to try it.  After approximately 15 minutes, I felt a little off.  I tried to calm my mind, control my breathing, slow my heartbeat... (with great effort) I did to some extent, but in the end, I failed.  No visuals to speak of, and also, the duration could not have been longer than 20 minutes.  Basically, it sucked.<BR>
<BR>
Possible conclusions:  A) I am immune.  B)  It wasn't K.  C)  It was not enough K for me.  D)  I have to break my tolerance for it.<BR>
<BR>
And in the case of D, do I want to 'break my tolerance'?  I do not think I am going to try K again at this point.<BR>

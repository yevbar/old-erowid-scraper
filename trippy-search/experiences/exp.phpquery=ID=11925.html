Setting: Mojave Desert, about 10 pm, July 15th, trip-hop house beats being played by a DJ. Preperation 3,000 mg of Vitamin C. I'm dancing wildly, have just taken the dropped acid, swallowed the upper, and the pill of E. The man calls the upper speed, but that can mean numerous substances. <BR>
<BR>
12 am: I'm dancing wildly, not quite realizing that I'm high, that is until I stop dancing for a moment to glare at the beautiful hill side scenery. The mountains are rolling with one another like grains of sand falling through an hour glass. I chat with a guy to my left who purchased his drugs from the same man. I ask if he'd like to go for a hike. <BR>
<BR>
1am to 4 am: We're walking up hills, I don't realize what an effort it takes to climb, my body does it automatically. We walk on and on. I feel the soft dirt parting like the red sea as I leave my foot prints. My visuals are scarce, but I have the strength of a giant and the gleeful naive smile of an infant. I have never felt so close to the earth, so close to harmony. I want to take off my clothes and masterbate in the soft, chilled dirt, but I've just met this guy who I'm hiking with, so out of common decency I don't. But to this day I wonder what the rest of my acid trips would have been like if I had. We walk on and on, until the tiki lights that lit the party cannot be seen and we begin to walk back, realizing that if we do not we could be eaten by mountain lions or tortured by a hillside serial killer. We walk on and on. I slip and fall down the mountain, walking away unscathed, but it is then that I realize that walking takes effort. <BR>
<BR>
6 am to 8 am. Watching the sun rise. I've never seen such a sky so beautifully set ablaze by a ball of fire light years away. I am with my best friend, her boyfriend, and two other friends who are dating. Friend throws up from morning sickness, but it seems as though demons who might harm her baby are leaving her body. A guy crawls around in the dirt, it looks so fun. I dirt and slide, like slip and sliding, but in the dirt. A boy of 10 years old there w/ his parents and elder brother looks at me. He explains to me his theory of ravers who do drugs. I smile and tell him all sorts of complex theories that are wandering through my mind, and he listens, nodding some, retorting some, and looking at me like I'm crazy. I'll remember that boy until the day I die, as I felt so connected with mother nature. He was the most philosophically mature 10 year I've ever met. We soon left after smoking a bowl of pot, lighting the mary jane with some girl's glasses and the sun. I don't feel any of the drugs fading, I'm wide awake as 9 am rolls towards us. The e has faded, but I'm still jolly. The speed and acid are keeping me awake and feeling serene. <BR>
<BR>
I'd recomend the combonation to anyone who knows how to relax and is willing to give up bullshit for an hour, but bring a FLASHLIGHT if you're going to go hiking. During another desert party a friend didn't realize where the edge of a cliff was while on halucinagens and fell down, breaking his leg.<!--   End Body   -->

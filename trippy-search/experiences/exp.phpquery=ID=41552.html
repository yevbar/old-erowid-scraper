I dissolved 30mg of DOI into solution to measure and took about 3mg at 6:10.<BR>
<BR>
6:35 - I think I feel different, possibly more alert, yet calm. A comfortable mental stimulation (nothing felt in the body).<BR>
<BR>
7:10 - Mild trails can be seen for the last 10 minutes or so. Its slowly building up to something, seems a slower onset compared to DOB. For some reason I feel extra 'comfortable' though. In a good mood.<BR>
<BR>
7:20 - More visual changes coming, longer trails, body still feels 'comfortable', not stimulated or anything. I'm going to jump in the shower and make some food.<BR>
<BR>
8:30 - Definite nice visuals happening. I guess a good ++. Still feels light on the body, no stimulation - if i wanted to take a nap right now i could. DOB was a bit more jittery. There's a nice body buzz, sorta euphoric but in a different way than DOB.<BR>
<BR>
--------<BR>
<BR>
Well I forgot about taking notes after this, but i'd say between 2 1/2 and 3 hours after taking it i pretty much peaked or got to the plateau. It was a good strong ++. This stuff seems like a great mood booster, and has some great mental focus. A good creative tool, could sit for hours and draw, write/etc. I was jammin' on this sweet keyboard we have for a good while. Very interested in things overall. Seemed very social, although i ended up on the computer talking to people for most of that time.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike DOB which reminded me a lot of 2C-B, DOI doesn't remind me of 2C-I at all really. I'm now at T + 9:20, and it seems like its on its way down. Shorter lasting than DOB. It did take longer to come on though. Next time i'd probably snort it, as with DOB it worked fine that way -- made the come up almost immediate and it lasted shorter.<BR>
<BR>
Decent stuff.. I could see this being mixed with 2C-E also (as DOB + 2C-E is a sick, twisted, euphoric, genius mix!!) as its so light on the body.. Also could see upping the dose of this, more so than DOB because of its lightness on the body.<BR>
<BR>
I'm not sure which I like better.. DOB or DOI... I think taken by themselves, i'd rather take DOI again definitely..at a higher level. As for DOB, ever since I tried a mix of 1.5mg DOB/14mg 2C-E I don't know why i'd want to take either one apart again..incredible mix!<BR>
<BR>
I'd guess that lower doses would be great for staying focused, mentally alert, for studying or working on whatever...<BR>
<BR>
Well I guess thats all I have to add right now, I may edit this later to say when I fully came down/etc. .<BR>
<BR>
------<BR>
<BR>
Its about 12:30 after I dosed, i'm pretty much down, been 'down' for the most part since i think 9-10hrs. Anyway, i'm still awake (not because of the DOI just because I am), but damn, i'm in a great mood! Sorta motivated also.. I may try low doses like 1mg to see if it gives me some mental energy/mood lift. Me likes<!--   End Body   -->

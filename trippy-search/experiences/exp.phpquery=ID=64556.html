This is probably the strangest collection of events that have occurred to me. Let me tell you what happened in my point of view, ok? Imma start before I even knew about Datura or even taking it for that matter. It was Wednesday and I had a normal day. I went to sleep and when I woke up, it was Friday! Now I had no idea how that happened but I eventually assumed I was retarded and yesterday was Thursday, not Wed. So it was friday and I had another normal day. I went to bed and woke up on Saturday on schedule.<br>
<br>
Later that night my buddy comes up to me with these flowers and tells me that they are Angel's Trumpet and if I took em I'd trip balls haha. I went ahead and made some tea with the 4 flowers he gave me and then turned the tea into some kool-Aid, which tasted like normal Kool-Aid. I sat on the couch watching tv, and smoking pot waiting for the effects. My buddy is there to watch, he didn't wanna do em yet so if I do something stupid then he can settle me down. Now about an hour and a half later I get up and feel a bit off-level. It's not like being drunk but it felt like it. It felt like I can feel how fast the earth is moving and every now and then I would lose my balance and grab on to something nearby. <br>
<br>
I stepped out onto the front porch for some air and saw some black dude trying to get into my buddies truck. By now I don't feel drunk anymore because I'm focused on something else. I yell at the guy what the hell are you doing by that truck? The man doesn't react so I run back inside to tell my buddy some dude is trying to break into his truck, so I run back outside and the guy walks around to the other side of the truck to try the other door. I walk towards him asking him what the hell he is trying to do. I seen him walk around the truck and he crouched down to where I could only see his head. I walk up to him and tap him on the head and what do ya know I was tapping the side view mirror of the truck, which I thought was this guys head! He completely vanished into the truck. I was like, what the F just happened. I laughed a little because I already knew that it was the Datura making me see actual people walk around. So my buddy was telling me he didn't see anyone there and I just told him never mind because I just hallucinated a real life looking person try to break into your truck. <br>
<br>
I went back inside the house and my buddy went into his room. I look out the window to see if the dude came back yet and amazingly I see and old man, woman, and 3 kids sittin inside my buddy's truck! I noticed that they were transparent. So I figured that they were probably ghosts. I went back outside to take a closer look a them but the closer I got the more they started to fade away. Vice versa, I decided to experiment and start walking backwards toward my house and they started to fade back in. I looked around the yar trying to play with my eyes focusing in and out, then I discovered orbs floating all over the place near the ground. I couldn't actually see them, they kinda distort what ever is behind it. Like the grass was distorted and looked like small spheres I could see through. I felt completely normal on the mental side. I didn't have any slurred speech or anything. The only thing that changed was my vision. It's like I had the 6th sense, and it was pretty cool. <br>
<br>
I went back inside and when I did, some of the orbs and misty entities followed me inside. When I shut the door I heard a knock right away. I opened it and it was my group of friends. They wanted to come and chill so I let em all in. Some of them were transparent, ghost-like, while some looked real as can be. I shut the door and went to the bathroom to see my eyes. Wow, I didn't have blue eyes anymore, my eyes were just as black as the devil himself. I was like woah and amazed. <br>
<br>
I went back out into the living room and everyone had disappeared. However I knew they were still there because when I looked at the tv I could see their faint reflections off of the tv screen. Now that I know I can see them via mirror reflections. I asked them to follow me into the bathroom for another experiment. I lit a candle and shut the bathroom door. I didn't see them in the mirror anymore, but when I looked at the bottle of listerine on the sink, I saw its shadow on the wall from the candle and I also saw two hands trying to push the top of the bottles shadow, and two more shadow hands pushing the bottom of the bottle on my side. I figured that they wanted to try and move the bottle, but no matter how hard they tried to move it, I only saw the bottle scoot a little a few times. I guess it takes a lot of energy from the other side to make any change on this side. I told them they could stop trying and the shadowy hands let go of the bottle and faded away into the shadows.<br>
<br>
I left the bathroom and went inside my room. I have a couple of dresser mirrors sitting in the corner of my room and I saw a couple of my friends by reflection sitting on my bed and in another corner of my room smoking pot. I went to go get my pot to smoke, then noticed my buddy was walking around and I asked him if he wanted to hit the pipe. He just wandered away from me and faded away! I was pretty confused, then I remembered he told me he was going to bed before I went into the bathroom. <br>
<br>
I went to knock on his bedroom door to wake him up. He appeared again in the living room then walked back into his room right through the door. I heard a sonic boom after that. My buddy had woke up and came out of his room to ask me what I wanted. I told him I just saw his spirit wandering around, while he was asleep! He said cool, but you know that probably really was my spirit wandering around because that’s what happens when everyone sleeps. Right then I realized that all the spirits outside my door was probably everyone in the neighborhood sleeping at home.<br>
<br>
Another thing, when I went to go wake up my buddy, I noticed the clock said 2:30pm. After he woke up and we chilled in the living room, the clock said 12:30pm. I was confused, but I guess I was in the future too for a while. I was ready to go take a nap so I went to sleep for a few hours. When I woke up my eyes were still dilated, and I wasn’t able to read anything closer than 2 feet in front of me. The effects wore off after a couple of days.<!--   End Body   -->

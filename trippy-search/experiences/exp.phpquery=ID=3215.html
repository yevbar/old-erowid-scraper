Last week I endured the most unbelievable experience of my life.  I decided to go all out and get really fucked up.  A few weeks before I had taken these pills at a party and I enjoyed them very much.  But I wanted to see what they could really do by going to the extreme two boxes of them instead of one. At the time I had no idea what I was getting myself into.  The first time I took 16 and yes, it was very crazy, but nothing compared to my next trip.<BR>
<BR>
It all started by me and my friends sitting around with nothing to do, and we had just spent the last of our money on a bag, which we had smoked hours earlier.  So we were trying to think of a cheap way to get high without doing the normal, e.g. huffing gas, glade, or other household materials.  And I convinced all my friends that if we could get some coricidin cough and cold pills I could guarantee them all that it would be the most crazy trip they had ever been on. So we went to a local grocery store and my friend M stole 6 boxes of them.  We got back to my house and distributed to boxes out to everyone.  The two girls there didnt want to take 16 so they both took 8 leaving 16 extra.  So I decided to take the extra 16 pills, not really know what would be different from my first trip and not really thinking about there being a difference.<BR>
<BR>
I took the pills and within minutes my stomach was starting to hurt.  I threw up about 20 minutes after taking them and the second after I was done puking I fell back, or atleast it felt like I fell back and I was gone.  I mean I was completely out of it.  Everything I had ever known, cared about, or even thought about were gone.  I felt like all my actions were opposite of what I was trying to do. I tried to walk forward and I would walk backward. I tried to close my eyes but I still saw images.  This really started to scare me. Though I had no sense of who or what I was, I was in a mind state of complete paranoia. I felt like everything was wrong, and it was gonna stay this way forever.  fter about 2 hours of this madness I could finally stabalize myself enough to walk to my bedroom.  I payed no attention to anyone else, I really dont remember even seeing anyone in the room. When I walked, I felt like I was off-balance. Like I was walking on a ball the was spinning under my feet. I got to my bed and layed down.  Right when I layed down I start to fall and this feeling last about 5 minutes until I exploded into a million peices.  Then I was sucked back into my regular form and I was sitting in the audience of a television show and I was watching myself as the actor. I tried to yell but I couldnt move. I was froze. From then on I dont really remember much except, if I was to fall asleep I would just wake up feeling even more weird then before. I finally did fall asleep and the whole next day I was weirded out. I didn't get visuals but I didnt feel like a human being.<BR>
<BR>
I dont know if I will ever do them again, and I do not recommend taking this amount to anyone. I know it sounds awesome but it was the biggest drain on my mind I have ever felt.  I still dont feel mentally stable. I dont really have emotions any more.  I do not recommend these pills to anyone.<!--   End Body   -->

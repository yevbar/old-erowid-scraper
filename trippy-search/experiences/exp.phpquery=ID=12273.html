The first time I used this drug was to say the least: better than the second.<BR>
<BR>
First time: My friend sent the night at my house and talked me into taking 16 pills. He can talk anyone into anything; he could have told me to shoot myself in the face and I'd probably do it. Once we each took the 16 pills it was going okay. I smoked about a half a bowl (of marijuana) and I was toasted. I was wearing a hooded sweatshirt and the drawstring kept moving around like a snake. I kept blacking out and my friend kept jerking me awake. He wasn't having nearly as much trouble as I was. I think I finally passed out around 1:00am (after taking it around 10:00pm). The next morning was funny as hell. I had no recollection of ANYTHING I did the night before. My friend told me everything. The following list is a list of stupid shit I did while on Dimenhydrinate.<BR>
<BR>
- I was laying on that spoke that goes on your toilet paper holder.<BR>
- I found my bed sheets all balled up and thrown in the trashcan.<BR>
- I went into the bathroom to put my contacts in (I don't remember taking them out) and found one contact in the case and one hard as a rock laying on the bathroom counter and the cap to the left side of my contact case was gone (I found it literally 2 months later, under my bed.).<BR>
<BR>
According to my friend: in the middle of the night I woke up, put my jacket on, walked over to my bedroom door and said, 'It's time to leave.', stood there for about five minutes then got back in bed.<BR>
<BR>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<BR>
The next time I did it (600 mg) I was hoping for some hallucinations. I however had a 'worse trip'. All I know (according to my friends) I passed out three times that night. Then I woke up staring at my friend's basement door (I don't know how I got there), walked over to the couch I was lying on and saw my friend's boots laying there I picked them up. THEY WEIGHED LIKE 10 POUNDS! I looked up in shock to find my friend lying there with his feet inside his boots. I went back to the door then did the boot thing a second time!<BR>
<BR>
I know this may be a little hard to swallow for some people. But I swear every word of it is true. If you knew me you know I wouldn't lie about something that pointless. I only lie to save my ass.<!--   End Body   -->

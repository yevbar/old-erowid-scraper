<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</FONT><br>
<br>
I am going to revisit and explain my first real trip ever(several months ago).  Prior to this trip I had drank alcohol, smoked marijuana, and tried of half-pill of 2C-E with little to no effects. I also had tried twice before about a month prior, 4ho-dipt.  Since I had only taken a half-pill I had only minor effects and was nothing I would consider tripping worthy.   I had no idea on what I was really getting myself into.  <br>
It was Saturday night and my friend A, told me he had a few 2C-E pills, so me, “Lee”, and “Ryan” decided to take them, and stay at Ryan’s house. This was also Ryan’s first trip, but Lee had done about 15 times before so he was quite experienced with the substance.  We took the pills at around 8:00, and then waited down in Ryan’s room to wait for the effects to come.  We were told that each pill had around 20 mgs in them.  From what I knew the trip was going to last around 10 hours and could be quite intense, so I was a bit nervous. <br>
<br>
At around 9:30, Ryan and Lee stated that they might be starting to feel the effects, so we decided to take a short walk around his neighborhood and smoke some pot.  After walking for a short bit, we realized that none us were really feeling much and decided to go back inside, since it was chilly out.  <br>
<br>
It took about an hour after ingesting them I started to feel the effects, along with Ryan and Lee too.  At first it was a sort of indefinable feeling.  At about a hour an a half into it, Ryan said that he was starting to have visuals.  I then put my head into Ryan blanket, only to see that the blanket was morphing and moving about in pattern like ways. After we all decided we were all beginning to trip we decided to go upstairs and watch Fantasia. Prior to going upstairs I did not think I was that fucked up.  <br>
<br>
We got up to the living room, and put in Fantasia.  I have not seen this movie since I was a kid, and didn’t really have any memories of it other than it was pretty fucked up.  My friend Lee said he had waited a long to watch this movie while he was tripping and he said that it should be amazing.  Amazing- can’t even describe it with justice.  When the movie started my visuals were at full force.  This was all new to me I had no idea that it would be this intense or insane.  I was transported into other worlds.  My visuals were so profound and realistic.  Throughout the movie there would be certain times that my body would literally just say this is soooo much, and I would have to grasp onto Lee in shear bewilderment.  <br>
<br>
One visual I remembered very well was when I had looked at the ceiling, which I might add is the best tripping ceiling I have ever seen, was when I looked at it, it turned into a waving carpet that looked gorgeous and sooo comfortable that I actually felt myself turn upside down and walk on this carpet.  I still don’t know if anyone heard me or I was just talking to myself, but for a good 30 seconds I was standing and walking on this carpet of heaven and was telling everyone how good it felt.  Then focusing my attention on the television screen I had notice in the corner of the room next to where the tv was there was this blonde women impersonating Marilyn Monroe. It was mind blowing-she was there! Then I shook my head and realized that it was a coat rack! WTF! I was fucked up.  <br>
<br>
My visuals were swarming and moving everywhere. Both Lee and Ryan were experiencing the same thing.  We watched the movie till there was around 30 minutes left and decided we couldn’t watch it anymore, it was too out there and we were already out of our minds.  <br>
<br>
We decided to go downstairs and Ryan decided to play Halo 2.  Me and Lee, then and afterwards, still agree that playing video games are not a good idea, since they seem to lessen all visual effects and distracts all attention into the game.  The real reason why I believe Ryan might have decided to play the game may have been that he was tripping too hard and needed something to relax him and distract him.  We watched him play video games for about an hour, then my friends A and J, came over. They reeked of skunky marijuana and told us that they had just picked up a couple ounces of the stinkiest shit of all time ( Ryan’s house was the stash house for my friends shit).  I couldn’t tell if it was me tripping or it was them, but me and Lee both agreed that they seemed to be acting very strange and distant. It was very odd of them.  They just seemed really paranoid.  <br>
<br>
We hopped in J’s car and we drove around with them to smoke a couple bowls around the neighborhood.  I could tell it was good shit, but since I was tripping my balls off I couldn’t even tell if I was hitting it or anything, I was out of my mind, happily.  Every time I looked through the front of the car’s window the road would melt and end. It was nuts.  When we got back, we chilled in Ryan’s living room.  It had been about four hours since we had taken the pills.  Prior to this point, a kid a few years younger than us had been calling all of my friends including me, asking for weed.  Since Ryan and I had been tripping soo hard we weren’t about to answer our phones.  <br>
<br>
All of a sudden while we were chilling in the living room, we heard loud knocks on the window looking into the living room.  The blinds were closed so we just sat there and hoped it would go away.  Ten minutes later, after trying to call us some more times, he came through the front door.  I was bewildered, I had no idea what to think.  He came downstairs, having a couple friends also with him, and started asking and yelling at us why we didn’t answer our phones.  A little background on this kid- he is only 16, but is 6'3 and is one of the most massive kids I have ever seen.  He has always liked and somewhat looked up to me, but not this night.  I couldn’t tell if it was the 2C-E or he was that maniacal and insane.  <br>
<br>
One awesome part the whole time he was there, was that I was looking at the ceiling the whole time and it was ferocious ocean with waves colliding everywhere, it was beautiful.  They eventually left, with his last words to me stating that he hated me and wanted to fight me, I laughed to him in a hysterically maniacal manner. <br>
<br>
From then on the rest of the night was kinda of a blur.  I remember just being downstairs and being mesmerized by the video games for hours. I was in a Halo world.  The next thing I remember is laying on the couch in the living room with Lee and Ryan.  One very noticeable and positive thing I really enjoy about 2C-E is how much I laugh.  Everything is hilarious.  Me and Lee stayed upstairs and talked about our trips, Ryan, though we actually had no idea, figured was downstairs playing video games or spacing out.  It was now around 3 am and the trip was slowly decreasing.  Me and Lee talked about how hard we were tripping earlier and how we want those effects again right now.  <br>
<br>
At around 4 we decided to drive to the grocery store and get some food.  By this time I was definitely almost back to baseline, but had after effects almost like a long hard day and I am exhausted.  My head pounded more than it ever has before in my life. During our voyage to get some food, we had, what I found to be, some of the best geek out moments I have been honored to be apart of.  <br>
<br>
At 5 we decided to go to sleep. I eventually fell asleep around 5:30, still with a terrible headache.  A strange thing I noticed while trying to go to sleep was that I must have been still tripping slightly because I felt like I was on a roller coaster. That is probably the best way I think of to describe the 2C-E trip- a roller coaster ride.     <br>
<br>
I awoke the next day feeling fine, a little tired, but I am sure that has more to do with that I had to get up at 9:30 to go out to breakfast with my family.  Overall the 2C-E trip was absolutely fantastic and mind blowing.  It has changed my life.  Doors in my brain have been opened I have never even dreamt of.  This first trip was perfect and introduced me into a world of psychedelics I do not think I could live with out.  It is now several months after my first 2C-E experience (having only tried a half-pill with no effects, and only smoking and drinking before), and the various drugs I since taken go as followed- some more 2C-E , 4ho-dipt, shrooms, ecstasy(bunk shit), coke(once in a lifetime), DXM, amphetamines, and among my new favorites LSD.<!--   End Body   -->

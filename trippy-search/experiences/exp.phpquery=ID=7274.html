<!--   Start Body   -->


I've taken a fair amount of acid the past few years, but none at all the past 5 or 6 months.<BR>
<BR>
Last night I took 2 papertrips -'blotter' a madhatter and a california sunshine, I was at a friends house, who refused to do acid, this is because of bad comments passed to him about the drug, he said he'd wait and see how well i was doing before he'd munch 1... so we are alone, music was playing, mainly listen to soft rock (Limp Bizcit, Korn -some house) mood was awsome, have no fears of parents rocking up or just uninvited guests...<BR>
<BR>
I munched at about 21:30, he ditched me a while to go and get some coke for him, and later, save some for me...<BR>
<BR>
So I felt all the usual about 45 minutes later, things start moving, etc... and I noticed an ant that appeared to be many ants after about 5 minutes (I think 5 minutes), this ant just became more and more ants, it was hectic and i thought I should take the show to another room till he got back...<BR>
<BR>
It bothered me to walk to the next room, cause it was like replacing your thoughts of that room in another room, I didn't feel comfortable once, uptight, metalic taste in my mouth, my eyes kept on delaying...I walked into his glass sliding door and this was completely hectic, cause that moment just kept on playing back in my head, and I felt like I was to be carefull of where I was walking and not to stand on anything..(there is nothing to stand on).<BR>
<BR>
He got back at about 22:15 and when he walked in the first thing he said was, 'did you notice the sliding door?' and that just freaked me out. Were ants everywhere or I was just too scared to want to notice ants, and he didn't know about the sliding door, he meant that he just that day had a sliding door put into his lounge... this is not how I thought of it though...<BR>
<BR>
I thought he knew...<BR>
<BR>
He had the coke and began cutting the shit on his glass table, it looked dirty and unclean in full meaning of the word, I felt like my life was going to end with a line...like that line could ruin my life, I mean 'it is cocaine you know'<BR>
<BR>
We wondered around his house for a while talking and laughing at weird and sort of storyless pictures hung on his walls, it depressed me how he could have a picture of his grandmother on the wall and right next to it have a picture of 2 dwarf mime artists playing tricks on each other, something about that made me think of treachery and just then I started to discover(in my head) that his whole family are treacherous toward each other and just some things made me think of him becoming treacherous toward me, and I became more uncalm and more hectic and I couldn't look at him the same...<BR>
I thought he would at some point stab me, and do things to me that would end our friendship...<BR>
<BR>
I couldn't handle the sight of him, and he kept on pushing me for an answer... wanting to know why I couldn't trust him or talk to him, to me it was like he was starting to torture me for something I wouldn't tell him...<BR>
<BR>
He kept on telling me, 'dude the acid is fucking you up' like over and over again he would tell me this... and he tried to explain that he is one of my best friends and that he would never fuck me around... or backstab me in anyway...he convinced me to have a line of coke with him, but all the way to doing this...it was about 01:00 and we sat infront of the table with the 'c' and we just talked and shit looked like it was engulfing him and I felt like I was about to become a victim of lies, so I grabbed the card and told him that I should cut the line...I was adamant to cut the lines, and he said to me: 'dude, you are like my brother (but looked like he meant it) why tha fuck would I want to do these things, you are never munching acid with me again, and I am never taking this shit.' <BR>
<BR>
I cut the lines about 4cm's long and about 3mm thick, I shnarfed first, as soon as my head rose, for some reason I laughed in such a cynical way and (a burst) he looked at me and I just saw him as like my protector, and the hallucinations toned down by like 80% and I was on an elite coke vibe, plenty of depth in thought (but in a realistic manner) I felt completely comfortable as he shnarfed his line, and he said to me when he rose from the table, 'I lost you just now, and where ever you were, you are not taking me there.'<BR>
<BR>
No more acid for ME, no more acid EVER, not in this lifetime, depending on the music and vibe and place, things can become so sick and twisted that I forget reality so harshly that people can look by 1 action like they are conspiring against you...<BR>
<BR>
The coke helped me to forget my fantasy (this was chaos) always talking about how fun the world would be in complete Anarchy...<BR>
<BR>
LSD helped me to realise that it was the world I created for myself, but that world will help me to only become more Chaotic in my head if I continue to be rebelious in words and in action...<!--   End Body   -->

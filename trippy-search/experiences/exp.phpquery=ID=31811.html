LSD being all but extinct in Central Florida, I decided to dose on its red-headed step child, LSA. After all, how much of a difference can one letter make.<br>
<br>
4:00pm - I dumped out all of my seeds into a huge pile, and began counting out my dose. It's a tedious task, so I lit an encouragment cigarette.<br>
<br>
4:15pm - My eyes are crossed from counting all those little black seeds, but I finally finished. I lit a celabration cigarette, and started eating.<br>
<br>
4:30pm - I finished choking down the store-bought seeds, funguscides and all. Smoked an accomplishment cigarette.<br>
<br>
5:00pm - It's been about four cigarettes since I swallowed my last seed, and I'm starting to feel somthing. Mainly horrible nausea, and a pain in my legs.<br>
<br>
5:15pm - My cell phone rings. I miss the call, because for some reason I can't tell where the ringing was coming from. My complete lack of sound perception was the first sign of the trip to come. <br>
<br>
I pop in a favorite movie of mine, 'GO'.<br>
<br>
5:45pm - I got into the movie, and the next thing I knew, I noticing undeniable, acid-like visual distortions (though they were relatively mild). All of the characters in the movie had the primary colors shooting out from their sillouettes. Everything seemed really 'pixelated'.<br>
<br>
6:10pm - I looked around my living room, and I felt like I was in a pastel painting. It was beutiful, yet simple.<br>
<br>
Spent about ten mintues staring at my A/C vent, watching it spin into itself. Pure insanity.<br>
<br>
6:25pm - My nausea had almost completely subsided, and I was having a pretty decent trip. I put on some tunes and explored my house. I was captivated by just about everything I walked past.<br>
<br>
7:00pm - I layed down in my bed, and the peak of my trip was becoming surprisingly strong. I noticed a single geometric pattern spining, taking up my entire field of view. My feelings of 'Wow, a pattern' turned into 'This pattern is God, I must listen to God', and eventually to complete ego loss.<br>
<br>
9:00pm - The pattern started fading, and I was slowly re-entering reality. There were still tracers-a-plenty, and lots of other noticable effects.<br>
<br>
10:00pm - I'm just about baseline, with an empty pack of cigarettes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
**Comments**<br>
<br>
Surprisingly good trip. It doesn't compare to acid in intensity, but it's the best high you'll find in Home Depot.<br>
<br>
Though the pattern was pretty good, there was only one. The entire trip, I was staring at the same 2-d pattern.<br>
<br>
I may have downplayed the nausea in the report, but it is really bad. I threw up at least five times. But it will eventually subside.<!--   End Body   -->

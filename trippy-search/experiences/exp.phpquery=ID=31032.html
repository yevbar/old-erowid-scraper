This if my first time so I don’t really know how all this is going to affect me. I wanted some coricidin cough and cold but because of the new age policy on it I couldn’t get it. So I opted for nutmeg because I had read about it. I don’t really know if I believe that it will work or not. We’ll see I guess.<br>
<br>
Okay its 9:00 p.m. and I just finished off my 3 teaspoons of nutmeg. I used the ground up kind. Everyone keeps saying to use whole but the store didn’t have it so I just got a bottle of the ground up stuff. I don’t know why everyone keeps talking about having to gag through it. I put the 3 teaspoons worth in a cup and poured in a little bit of Pepsi. It fizzed up and got foamy so I decided to spoon the foam into my mouth and wash it down with more Pepsi. I wouldn’t say it was a pleasant experience however it was not as bad as I thought it would be. Anyway I’m already beginning to feel a little “high” already. Equivalent to if I shared a joint of some mids with a friend. So far it’s a very pleasant feeling.<br>
<br>
Its midnight, 3 hours has passes since I took the nutmeg, the initial high wore off after about half an hour. Right now I feel no different than if I hadn’t ever taken it to begin with except for when I burp I get the taste of nutmeg but that’s besides the point. However I have not given up all hope yet because in all the accounts I’ve read it is stated that it takes 5 hours for it to take effect. I’m just hoping I'll be able to stay up til 2 when the trip should really kick in.<br>
<br>
1:20 and I feel nothing but a very mild sense of disorientation. I doubt I would even notice it if it wasn’t for the fact that I am expecting to feel something. Maybe that’s my problem, I keep waiting for something to happen. I wish I would just lay back and let it hit me but the whole idea of getting high off nutmeg is too fascinating for me to forget its going to happen, at least I hope it happens.<br>
<br>
Well, its 2:00 and has been 5 hours since I consumed the 3 teaspoons of nutmeg and I’m left with nothing more that a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe it was the fact that I didn’t buy the whole nutmegs and grind them however other people have said that’s works. Ill try to stay up another hour just to make certain nothing happens but I’m pretty disappointed that nothing happened yet.<br>
<br>
Well, it’s 10:30 the next morning. I don’t feel anything. Back to baseline without leaving it. I’m going to try to find some of the nutmeg that isn’t already ground and try my luck again. But as far as what I used nothing really happened.<!--   End Body   -->

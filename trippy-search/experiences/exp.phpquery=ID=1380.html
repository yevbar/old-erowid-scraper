Well, I'm not a regular user and certainly not an addict. But I also know that when I do it and get lit up, I have to do it smart. People are going to always use drugs and if they do they should take precautionary measures to make sure you get a great high, but not deplete your body of energy and nutrients so badly you become emaciated and an addict.<br>
<br>
Once a month or so, I decide to get lit up. I'm not your typical user as I am not white, I am upper-middle class and Asian. I used to do coke but coming down from that was like the worst depression and paranoia of all my drug experiences. Plus its so expensive and you need to do more of it, more often, since technically and physiologically the high lasts only 20 minutes.<br>
<br>
I tried speed about three years ago at a party. Noticing there were differences in colors from a brown sugar look to white powder and all yellowish colors mixed in between I took the browner powder and it burned my nose so bad I thought my nose hairs had fallen out. It definitely gave a rush like cocaine, but it was different...I liked it better. It was actually fairly mild and gradual. Having a hyper personality to begin with speed, like ritalin, actually slows me down. Most people I know who ingest it or snort it become hyper active clowns!!  I become much more able to think clearly, move more deliberately, and become very focused. So maybe its true....ritalin and Adderall work on hyperactive minds like mine and it allowed me to think very clearly and not so quick on the draw.<br>
<br>
I began to throw up later in the evening and din't like the fact that for the next four days I was up...and no matter what I did I couldn't sleep.<br>
<br>
Then a friend showed me the right way to do it. Here's my recipe for a better and healthier speed experience:<br>
<br>
<UL><br>
<LI>I always eat a good, healthy meal beforehand since it kills the appetite afterwards.</li><br>
<LI>I take a regular vitamin and then extra vitamin B 12 because any stimulant (as well as stress) depletes your body of B 12. I take one calcium supplement and drink lots of fluids. </li><br>
<LI>Then I take three regular aspirin so that my blood pressure won't surge, as aspirin thins the blood, lowering my chances of a cardiac arrest or something.</li><br>
<LI>Then I do some lines, as I need them, moderately, all the while drinking lots of gatorade because now I can't eat.</li><br>
</UL><br>
<br>
The key is to replenish what is lost. Brush your teeth frequently...at least 3 times because we all know it leaves that pasty rotten taste, not to mention it can rot your teeth over time ...<br>
<br>
Then I'm also doing the white powder speed....a much smoother ride and does not make me as jittery. I will take a few more aspirins and then after being lit up...again, speed has the opposite effect on me...sure it gives me a rush, like a big intake of air, and makes my brain clear and sharp and actually makes me able to control my hyper, energetic behavior. I move more slowly and deliberately on it and find myself communicating to others in a way I might not be able to.<br>
<br>
Limit thyself, replenish with fluids and vitamins, and just do it moderately. Why get off at 150th street when you can just get off at 10th street? Moderation of usage and proper replenshing of the body's depleted nutrients and fluids are the key.<!--   End Body   -->

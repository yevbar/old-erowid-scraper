Background and stats: <br>
<br>
-22 year old female, 5'1', about 105 or 110 pounds. <br>
-Clinically depressed, frequent suicidal thoughts with mild ADHD and anxiety.<br>
-frequent alcohol and marijuana user, experience with nutmeg, DXM<br>
-previous pharm experience with Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Celexa, Zoloft, Prozac, Ambien<br>
-Prescribed Vyvanse for ADHD and to encourage sociability after Wellbutrin failed to do anything.<br>
-Important to note, I suffer from Hyperhydrosis, a genetic disorder that causes abnormal amounts of sweating from my hands and feet. This causes me a lot of social problems, but more importantly for this report, it causes dehydration from drug use to happen much faster and more frequently.<br>
<br>
<br>
It is apparently becoming increasingly difficult to get psychiatrists to prescribe Adderall over Vyvanse because of Vyvanse's chemical composition which makes it act more slowly over a longer period of time, decreasing abuse potential. Whatever, lets try anyway!<br>
<br>
9:00 AM - Take 150mg of Lisdexamfetamine in 5 30mg capsules at once. Drink about 30 ounces of water.<br>
<br>
9:30 AM - Get a biscuit and some hashbrowns from chik-fil-a. MMM!<br>
<br>
10:00 AM - no major effects, notice a slight elevation of mood.<br>
<br>
10:22 AM - Notice repeated chills causing goosebumps all over body, pleasurable. Sense of well-being and slightly blurred vision. Increased amount of sweating from palms. <br>
<br>
10:30 AM - Notice increased mood elevation still, like I am slowly creeping towards what I hope to be a very pleasurable euphoria. Sweating is still there, but I don't care, dry mouth is happening too. I live in a HOT state, so this doesn't help at all.<br>
<br>
11:00 AM - I feel really high. My brain is totally wired right now and feels amazing. The Euphoria is very strong and highly pleasurable. Watching a TV show online, it is overly interesting. I am not very religious, but I feel like praying for some reason and do so for about 15 minutes. I feel somewhat spiritually connected to God at this point; it was interesting and instilled me with a lot of hope and security toward my future. I notice some minor/basic visual hallucinations - mostly just tracers behind lights and stuff like that.<br>
<br>
11:30 AM - Feeling very good, in a very pleasant state of euphoria, hopeful about the day, looking forward to life for once! Have a counseling appointment at 1:00 with a psychologist at my universities counseling center. I have a date at 6:00 with an older guy I've been seeing. I feel very good about today.  <br>
<br>
2:00 PM - Euphoria has basically worn off; however I have a good head buzz going. I have A LOT of energy, and felt extremely wired and talkative - I am usually a very shy girl. In my meeting with my counselor, and opened up about a lot of things with her, I felt extremely comfortable. She noticed my change in demeanor and I told her about the medication. <br>
<br>
Towards the end of the session she told me that I would likely need to seek counseling outside of the universities center because my problems with loneliness and depression are so long term. As a long term user of the universities counseling center I would normally be somewhat devastated by this, and I was frustrated and confused, but I did not feel totally horrible for some reason. I attribute this continued suspension in contentment and happiness to the pills.<br>
<br>
3:00 PM - I receive a phone call from the man I am dating and would be seeing that night. He informs me that we should probably no longer date because our age range bothers him (he is 29 and I am 22) and he can't get over it. I find this somewhat devastating as I really enjoyed spending time with him, but I manage to find a common ground of understanding and we say we will still be friends - even though we will probably never speak again. I am pretty emotionally fragile, and an event like this would normally have sent me spiraling into a depression, but it didn't; once again I thank Vyvanse for saving me from falling off the emotional cliff.<br>
<br>
5:00 PM - energy levels still very high. I am reading and studying various subjects, and reading as much information about Vyvanse on the internet that I can find. Mood is still good, but I think the peak has basically passed. Sweating and dry mouth remain. <br>
<br>
7:00 PM - I notice that I have not eaten all day since morning; I go to Wendy's and get a salad and some fries. I notice that it seems I don't really crave food at all. Appetite is all but gone, and I force myself to eat the food. At this point I have probably drank about 200 fluid ounces of water in the day, and still feel quite dehydrated. I really wish I was on that date, because I still feel extremely talkative and have no one to talk to!<br>
<br>
8:30 PM - I can feel myself coming down. Still wired and able to concentrate easily, but I can feel the depression seeping back into my head. I am reading a lot of things on the internet and taking a lot of interest in them still.<br>
<br>
9:45 PM - Reflecting on the days rather negative events, depression/minor suicidal thoughts ensues unfortunately. I'm not sure if I am crashing totally or if the drug is just wearing off slowly. <br>
<br>
10:00 PM - I prepare a bowl of weed and smoke it over the course of 5-10 minutes. This relieves any depression/self destructive feelings I was having.<br>
<br>
10:30 PM - I prepare about half a bowl and smoke it. I am pretty high from this. The amphetamines are still felt strongly though, I'm still somewhat wired and focused. The combination seems to make me rather antsy, I can't stop moving my legs and fidgeting. <br>
<br>
11:00 PM - the amount of weed I smoked combined with the coming down from the vyvanse has made me really tired, I get into bed and think for 15-20 minutes until I fall asleep.<br>
<br>
The next morning I am pretty dehydrated, somewhat depressed, but I feel okay and relieved that Vyvanse could provide me with some happiness and contentment for a while. Sort of ironic that I feel hopeful about being able to abuse a prescription drug, but that's fine with me!<!--   End Body   -->

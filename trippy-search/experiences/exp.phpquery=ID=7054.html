<!--   Start Body   -->


I took 10 packs, 1.3 grams each, I weigh 150 lbs, I have done the seed before and I only got a little body high along with some CEVs, they were Heavenly Blue (although they weren't too heavenly), oh and I washed them under water and ate them whole, well I chewed them up pretty well then swallowed.<BR>
<BR>
The 13 grams of Heavenly Blue morning glory seeds I ate sent me over edge.<BR>
<BR>
At first it was an ok trip, nice visuals, plenty of OEV and CEVs, some major audio distortions listening to The Doors.  Then I realized it was getting a little out of control and made some very incoherent posts on alt.drugs.psychedeilics (which can be found at www.deja.com just search for my name, Dumbass, and Morning Glory seeds, you'll find it.<BR>
<BR>
I called my girlfriend in the middle of the night and I wasn't coherent so she called my parents because I was acting crazy, my parents came in my room and I attacked my dog my brother, I attempted to eat a Doors CD (Absolutely Live) and I tore shit off my wall, my memory was screwed and I only rememberbits and pieces, it was fucked up.<BR>
<BR>
I ended up in the ER and spent Thursday night, all of Friday, and Saturday morning in the hospital, they gave me a bunch of sedatives, including Valium, but I don't remember any of this, they pumped me full of charcoal so I would throw it all up.<BR>
<BR>
I would wake up for a few minutes and say crazy things and throw up and go back to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
I had to be catherized twice, that's when they shove a tube into your penis and drain your bladder, not fun at all. Worst catherization ever (If you watch The Simpsons you know what I mean, like the Comic Book store guy).<BR>
<BR>
Overall it was an insanely intense trip, which I will not be repeating ever.  That's all I can think of now about the whole trip.<!--   End Body   -->

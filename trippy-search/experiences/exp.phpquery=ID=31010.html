Setting: at home<BR>
Dose: ~5.5mg<BR>
Time: around midnight<BR>
 <BR>
So, after a day of light drinking I came home and decided to try DON again.  I had wanted to try this again since my previous attempt (with ~3.5mg) barely achieved what I would consider a +2 on the Shulgin scale.  I had gotten minor (except for one instance that lasted about 3 seconds) visuals and an obvious stimulation the whole time, but I never really 'broke through,' so to speak.<BR>
 <BR>
So this time I had decided on a dose of ~4.5mg.  as I am measuring my dose out of the vial with a syringe, the unthinkable happens:  I drop it on the floor  luckily for me a)  my floor is clean, and b)  I missed the carpet.  so I busy myself with sucking up the piss-yellow liquid from the floor with an eyedropper.  I manage to recover about 5.5mg, and so I decide that will be my dose.  I had eaten about 1.5 - 2 hours previously.<BR>
 <BR>
About 30-45 minutes later I feel myself leaving baseline.  I feel a familiar stimulation, not unlike an amphetamine high.  It's not unpleasant, but at the same time not entirely pleasant, but stimulants aren't my favorite class of drugs most days.  my blood pressure is a bit elevated, and my heart rate is about double normal but nowhere near what I would consider dangerous.<BR>
 <BR>
Skip forward an hour or so.  I am now definitely tripping and  getting the same type of colorful fractal shifting I remember from my DOB trip (as well as numerous 2c-b trips), only nowhere near the intensity.  The stimulation is starting to annoy me though, so I decide to smoke a bit of pot to chill out a bit.  this turns out to be a good call.  It eliminates most of my nausea and kicks the visuals up a notch, and best of all, calms my nerves a bit - I had even had trouble loading a bowl to smoke because my hands were shaking too much.  A little shaking is normal for me, but this was to a higher degree than that, but it may also have been caused by not having had proper meals for a couple days.  Mental effects are slight 'trip-type' thoughts.  this is not something I would consider introspective at all.<BR>
 <BR>
Skip forward another hour or two.  I seem to have peaked.  The annoying stimulation seems to come and go in waves.  Whenever it's there I have a touch of nausea, whenever it's not there I have a great body rush.  At this point I consider a small dose of 2c-b, but decide that it would be a bit of overkill and smoke another bowl instead.  my hands are still shaking a bit, blood pressure still up, heart rate still up.  I am overwhelmingly hungry.  I normally don't get hungry on psychedelics - the DOx series seems to differ from the norm in that respect.  however, while I am hungry, eating seems like it would be too much of a chore, so I wait until later.<BR>
 <BR>
After a couple hours at plateau I start to come down, which is relatively uneventful.  I am feeling pretty cracked out by now - it's about 7AM and I haven't slept since about 11AM the previous day.  My heart rate is starting to slow down a bit, but I still have that 'I was up on a stimulant' type headspace.  I smoke a final bowl and the feeling goes away long enough for me to fall asleep.<BR>
 <BR>
All in all while I would like to try a higher dose again, the level of uncomfortable amphetamine 'pushiness' was just a little too much at this dose, and I don't see it diminishing if I were to take more. It's a bit of a moot point anyway, as I don't see anymore finding me.<!--   End Body   -->

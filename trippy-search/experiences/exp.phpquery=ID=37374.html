Okay first thing in the morning after the house is emptied of wife and kiddies I take two 10mg Valium. Within 20 minutes I'm feeling pretty good cuz I'm also doing a cold water extraction on 7 5/500 Vicodin tabs. <BR>
<BR>
The extraction is well explained elsewhere online for Codiene but, works just as well on Hydrocodone. I find that the best way to do it is to put the tabs into a little slightly warm water and let 'em dissolve completely into a paste for about 10 minutes. I end up with a paste that I then combine with with about 50ml of ice water stirring well. I use the top of a 2 liter soda bottle lined with a wet down coffee filter fitted over the top of a glass to extract the hydro. I filter once than add another 25ml of water to the sludge to get as much hydro out as possible. The whole process takes about 1/2 hour to 45 mins.<BR>
<BR>
Now it's time to pony up and suck down the extract. A lot of folks don't like the taste and sweeten it. I actually like the taste and just down it in a single gulp. Yum, Yum. Oh by the way I prefer to have an empty stomach for faster drug absorbtion. <BR>
<BR>
As an aside, I tend to stagger my doseage so that I at least maintain the illusion that there is some sort of process to be followed. I don't know what the effects of downing the Valium,Hydro, and Soma at one time would be but, I like to appreciate the finer points of first experiencing the Valium, then adding the Vicodin, and finally icing the cake with Soma. I not really looking for a faster coma.<BR>
<BR>
So I'm nice and Valium calm at the start. Wonderful and peaceful feelings predominate and I'm looking forward to adding Vikes. For me, I don't realize any 'buzz' so to speak from the Valium, just calm and feel that the stage is set to potentiate the Hydrocodone.<BR>
<BR>
Within minutes of downing the hydro extract I can feel my little benzo and opiod cocktail starting to kick in. Oh yes, here we go. Time to find a quiet corner and put on some music. Great combo, the body is gently bouyed by the narcos and the puts one's head into a good place to appreciate rhythms and patterns. I don't like to socialize under the influence. For me, that's just too much like work. What's best is solitude and comfortable surroundings. For some reason my cat seems to pick up on my vibe and becomes a purring pillow in my lap. The music choices I make are usually something along the lines of classic jazz (Miles, or Monk)or maybe some Floyd or Brian Eno. Doesn't really matter I suppose, what ever you like will work.<BR>
<BR>
About 25-30 minutes in I'm nodding like a rocking horse and seeing little pictures in my mind. Hard to keep the eyes open for more than a few seconds at a time. Peaceful body rushes roll in like a pleasure tide. Time means nothing, actually nothing means nothing. I'm reading the same line in a book about fifteen times and keep getting distacted by the incredible shadows and light that passes through my patio window. So,I go outside for a while and it's almost like a trip to Eden. The air smells so fresh and sun so warm that I'm even more transported into bliss.<BR>
<BR>
Back in the house, I notice that after about 1 1/2 to 2 hours that I can feel the lines of reality getting a little more defined and decide that it's time for the Soma. Doesn't take long for it to kick in due to all the other stuff still floating around my blood stream. Now I have to sit, because stumbling around is not at all dignified for someone my age. I don't know how dangerous all this is but, this really does help one to reach the apex of the narcotic summit. The nods are incredibly deep with my head on my chest most of the time. I'm in and out of conciousness but, hey, no worries. Breathing is fine and I'm just starting to get a bit of the itchies. My daydreams are indistingushable from reality and I live in a beautiful place in my head. Slowly the fog rolls in and now comes full on sleep and how lovely it is.<BR>
<BR>
I wake up after a short nap feeling good. Everything seems light and although I'm close to baseline sobriety the peaceful feelings will stay with me through out the day. <BR>
<BR>
So then, other than the VERY REAL possibliltes of addiction or overdose I find this to be a wonderful way to spend a couple of days in the week. I have been doing this combo for about 2 months and still (happily) consider myself a lightweight and plan to stay that way.<!--   End Body   -->

I was going to try LSA again via Hawaiian Baby Woodrose for the second time, hoping to achieve stronger effects than I had before.  In order to accomplish this goal I decided to take some Syrian Rue.  I never got as far as the LSA.<br>
<br>
I took a single Dramamine pill as recommended about half an hour before.  This had worked wonders on my last experience.  Having ground about a teaspoon worth of syrian rue, I put roughly half of it into a very small glass that I filled with a bit of lemon juice and water.  This I let steep for about 15 minutes. I found on sampling it that I had added way too much lemon juice for it to be tolerable, so I poured a bit into another small glass which I filled with water, diluting the concoction.  I did this three times, guzzling each glass as quickly as I could. <br>
<br>
Almost immediately I felt a severe stiffness in my neck, slight disorientation and a bit flushed.  I realized that I may have made a crucial error by not checking if Dramamine was a compatible drug with MAOI's.  I hadn't seen it in any of the common lists of drugs and foods to avoid, so I hadn't thought much of it.  I should have dug a bit deeper.  I jumped online and with just a few keywords searches found plenty of information warning against the combined use.  I ran to the bathroom and forced myself to puke.  I hadn't eaten in 11 hours or so, so this was a bit difficult.  Finally I forced up some mucus and seed bits.<br>
<br>
At this point it was too late, but thankfully I had only ingested about 1/4 to 1/2 of a gram of the seeds - though how much alkaloid content was in the water I drank is unknown.  Adverse symptoms would persist for several hours.  These included headache pangs around the temples, acute numbness in various parts of the body, flushing, and a feeling of fever which may have been genuine.  It was a very uncomfortable experience.  I drank a lot of water to try and flush my system as quickly as possible.<br>
<br>
I am very glad I took so little of both substances.  Had I taken more Syrian Rue I could have spent the night in the hospital, or suffered a worse fate.<!--   End Body   -->

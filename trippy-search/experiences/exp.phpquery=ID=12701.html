I was staying with my dad for the day, and the people he was living with broke out their glass pipe.  I have done meth before, but never with a parent, so I just ignored what they were doing.  After they loaded the second puddle (the meth in the bottom of the pipe), one of the roomates asked if I snorted or smoked, and offered me some.  I said it was up to my dad.  He said if I wanted some, have some.  She laid me out a small line, not enough to do anything for me, and I snorted it.  After about 10 minutes, I wasnt feeling anything, and quite dissapointed.  She noticed, and offered me the pipe.  <BR>
<BR>
After the first hit, I could already feel the rush of energy coming on.  I finished three more puddles with them. When we were done, I sat there for about three hours completely absorbed in a tattoo magazine.  I noticed every colour, detail, line.  I also got a much greater reaction to music. *I always notice much greater appreciation of the senses* After sitting there for a few hours, we went outside to smoke.  I didnt even notice the cold, I was up so high. Everything I did for about 5 hours after that, there was such a feeling of happiness, like I was doing exactly what I was supposed to be doing at that exact time.  I felt like I could do anything, I was not down at all.<BR>
At about 9 pm, we smoked another puddle.  I was starting to lose my energy, and that boosted it right back up.  <BR>
<BR>
After two days of nonstop smoking it, we were out.  We (my dad and I) went to a friend's house, who had enough for two big lines left.  He took one, I took the other.  After we finished that, I went for a ride with the friend to take something to his other house.  There were people there, and as soon as we pulled up we got paranoid that people would be able to tell so we didnt even go inside.  <BR>
<BR>
After that, we couldnt find anymore (not that we didnt try like hell!) and I was coming down hard.  I had no patience, I had a migraine from hell, and my body felt mangled after four days of no food, drink, or sleep.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, I have to say that this will not be the last time, far from it.<BR>
<BR>
Meth is not a drug to be played with.  It is extremely addictive, and poison to the  body.  Be careful.<!--   End Body   -->

At the time I hadn't experienced any 2C-x before and only experiencing LSD once. I didn't experience MDMA at this point either.<br>
<br>
My baggy of 500mg of 2C-E arrived in the mail. So, that night, a friend (let's call him S) were determined to try it out. There was only one problem, I live with goody-goods. They severely frown upon drug use (aside from alcohol and marijuana, they are ALL huge potheads, and I was too at this point in time). So if we did it we'd have to hide it. I ingested about 5-10mg using my pinky finger <FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: A volume amount of one powder doesn't necessarily weigh the same as the same volume of another powder. For substances active at such a small dose, eyeballing is particularly unwise. See <a href="../psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.html">related article</a>]</FONT> . Around 20 minutes later my friend S gets there and he does the same.  After about 30 minutes after he took his, I still felt nothing and he of course didn't either. We both did the same thing again, twice.<br>
<br>
I don't feel anything yet, being over an hour since I took mine, so I took some shots (they were having a party at my place that night, ALL of my goody good friends who think I'm a goody good too were there) with some friends and then went out to my car to smoke (it was winter, it was really really cold so we didn't want to smoke on the porch, it was warmer inside a car). This is where it started taking me in.<br>
<br>
After 2 bowls between four of us, the car was warmer and the windows were beginning to fog up. My dumb friends started drawing penises on the windows (haha). They're all very immature. I witnessed this and started feeling weird inside. Everything I saw was vibrating, like crazy. Lines around objects seemed to come to life, it was amazing. My pupils at this point were HUGE. Without thinking, I looked to my left and started drawing on my window, because I wanted to draw. I drew a 3D cube, very odd thing to draw I guess, my friend was like 'haha we all drew dicks and you drew a cube.' I didn't know what he was talking about so I just smiled. I looked to my left and saw the cube and thought to myself 'did I draw that?' I remembered now at that point that I did.<br>
<br>
We packed another bowl, after halfway through it, I looked down the street out the window. The lines of the street turned into math equations and numbers. I couldn't literally SEE the numbers and characters as if they were really there, it was just that instead of perceiving that there was a line there, I perceived it as an equation for how long it is. Of course the equations made no sense.<br>
<br>
We got out of the car and walked back in, the walk from the car to the house is about 10 paces, pitch black. It felt like I got lost for an eternity. Everything vanished for that mere 4 seconds and I thought I had gone blind. But I remembered I was on drugs so I kept my mouth shut. My friend in front of me opened the door to the house and my vision returned (aka there was light finally).<br>
<br>
I go back inside and ask S is he's feeling anything (it had been about an hour and a half since I took my first and about an hour and 10 minutes since he took his. He said 'I feel weird, but I don't see anything yet.'<br>
<br>
About another 30 minutes pass and everything is still vibrating and seeming to breathe. Then another wave hit me. I felt mentally insane, but I wasn't upset about it. If I closed my eyes, it wasn't black, it was white. And anything I wanted to see I would see. S tells me he started seeing vibrating lines and breathing and waving in objects. I told him I was seeing that for about an hour.<br>
<br>
Another 30 minutes pass and I still feel like I'm not peaking yet, like there's going to be more. I was right. It was getting late and everyone started leaving. S and I decided to try to play Call of Duty. I couldn't tell what was going on. I didn't know what that thing was in my hands (the controller) or what these little army guys are doing running around my TV. As soon as I forgot I was on drugs and that was why I didn't understand anything, the plateau struck. It was something I cannot explain. There was a loud, spacey-sounding (like old Starship Troopers FX or something) WOOOOSH in my head. I heard it and I felt it. Instantly I closed my eyes because it startled me. When I opened them, I couldn't believe what I was seeing (my friend S was playing now, kind of freaking out too but both of us were keeping our composure because my roommate and a friend were still downstairs). The characters on the screen weren't on a screen anymore, there was no more screen, they were just in front of me, running around and doing they're thing. It was like I was actually IN a war, it was exhilarating.<br>
<br>
'Want to play?' my friend S asks me, I break out of my trance and shake my head, the war was over (the round was over) and I could see my TV again. I replied with a no, knowing I didn't know what I was doing or what the Hell was even going on. My roommate goes to bed, so my friend J is forced to come upstairs and hang with me and S, because we're the only other ones up. He startled me because I forgot what people were. Everything I saw was like I was experiencing it for my first time. Like I felt like screaming 'Woh! LOOK AT THAT!' J started playing another round and I certainly knew I wouldn't be able to keep my composure because I feel another wave coming on. I tell them I'm gonna lay down because I'm really drunk (I wasn't drunk at all). S knew why I was leaving so he started working on getting rid of J. I went to my room with my lights off and shut the door. Worst mistake of my life.<br>
<br>
The things I saw in the dark were unimaginable (or so I thought). There were outlines of people and monsters peeking around every corner and looking at me. (the game room is right next to my bedroom, so I can hear bass and the noise from the game) I started hearing spacey sounding gun shots and booms. I didn't know it was the game, I thought I traveled into another dimension and all of these monsters and people were freaking out and shooting at me because I was there.<br>
<br>
I laid down on my bed and looked at my clock. I barely made out that it said '3:34' because it was changing colors and vibrating and shifting around in circles. I started freaking out. I thought I had overdosed and was going to die but for some reason I just let it happen.<br>
<br>
I looked at my hands in the darkness, each individual atom of my fingers started falling off and floating away into thin air. It continued down my arms, then my body, and my legs. Everything. I could see my bed through my body, as if I wasn't even there (to this day I can't explain how I saw that). I look up to the middle of my room, this little white ball of energy is floating there. So tiny, so small (I have floaters in my eyes, I think that's what I was seeing). It exploded, it started sucking everything in, EVERYTHING was being sucked into this white, black hole.<br>
<br>
I closed my eyes. Everything went white. I was dead. I was thinking to myself 'Oh my God... this is what happens when you die?! You become your own God and start your own universe?!' I was given a whole new, pre-Big Bang universe. I decided that I missed my family and friends and that I needed to recreate the universe to get them back. I knew it would take hundreds, thousands, millions, billions, trillions of years to do that, but I was prepared to. I created the big bang, started re-creating planets and galaxies and stars. It felt like 100 years in my head. I finally realized that my eyes were closed, so I opened them. My dark, creepy room was still there. I was still there. Everything was still vibrating and being extremely creepy but I was still alive. A sigh of relief comes over me. I look at my clock, '3:41'. I was astonished. <br>
<br>
I was upset. I wanted to cry. It had only been 7 minutes. I did all of that in 7 minutes. The mere thought of it disgusted me, I don't know why, I just wanted the trip to be over. S comes into my room, he looks at me and he's like, 'yo J finally left... holy shit man, you look like you've seen a ghost. What did you see in here?!' I simply said 'I can't begin to tell you.' I puked. Like I was puking out all of my old beliefs about life and death and making room for the new. I felt like a person in an insane asylum. Like the people rocking back in forth and sucking their thumbs, gazing into nothing. I could only imagine how effed up I looked.<br>
<br>
He came in my room and we looked at cool light shows and stuff on the computer and listened to music. But, I couldn't have fun. I was concentrating so hard on what just happened that that was all I could think about. I take him back to his car when I start feeling better (around 6). We end up sitting in my car, listening to music for hours, staring at the plants and such around us. They seemed like they kept dying and being reborn to the beat of the music. But that quickly faded, the trip was finally over, it was 10:00 AM.<br>
<br>
All in all, it was an amazing experience. I was traumatized for days after, but I felt enlightened. I then did some research and figured that I took a LOT. Please people, don't eyeball and don't ever do a drug without researching the dosage first.<!--   End Body   -->

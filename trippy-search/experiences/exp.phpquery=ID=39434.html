I had heard a lot of reports about Datura stramonium and was anxious to try it. Knowing the dangerous effects of the plant, I decided to start out with small doses. I first tried chewing four seeds but after an hour they seemed to have no effect. I then chewed another four seeds but again the same results. None. I decided to get braver and the next night I chewed twenty seeds. After an hour I felt nothing again. Now I was getting frustrated and tried forty seeds but once again I was disappointed with no effect. At this point I gave up on the seeds. I then tried smoking the leaves and I smoked four Datura cigarettes one after the other which had no effect what ever. I live alone and was unbothered by anybody. Being mindful of the dangers of Datura, I took no unnecessary chances. I waited until late evening about 7 P.M, to try the dry leaves. I took a handful of dry leaves and boiled them in three cups of water for thirty minutes.<BR>
<BR>
The concoction was very dark in color, and I strained the liquid with my strainer into a coffee mug. It smelled and tasted awful so I sweetened it with two table spoons of honey and drank it down quickly. I was immensely surprised at how quickly the effects came on. Within 10 to 15 minutes I began to get a feeling of being drunk. I knew that my best bet was to head straight for bed where I felt I would be safest. My usual nightly custom was to bring a glass of water into my bedroom with me but this night I was drunk by the Datura and I lost my balance and fell against the wall and down to the floor breaking the glass in the process. I returned to the kitchen sink and filled another glass of water but again my legs gave way under me and I fell down like a drunkard. Again I filled a glass with water but it somehow slipped out of my hands and crashed to the floor. By the time I finally made it to my bedroom, I had broken five glasses, but I wasn't aware of it until the next morning when I saw the damage.<BR>
<BR>
Finally resting in my bed I fell asleep quickly. I had an extremely vivid and realistic dream of an invisible being grabbing me and throwing me head first into a wall. Try as I did, I was unable to see it at all. Again he picked me up and slammed head first into the wall again. Then it began to beat me. It grabbed my fore arm and snapped it in two. My bones were protruding from my flesh and my blood was squirting high in the air. I pleaded with the being to leave me alone but it showed me no mercy. It picked me up again and slammed me head first into the wall once more. At that point I woke up and realized I was dreaming, but I was none the less quite shaken by the ordeal. I had the strangest feeling that the being was punishing me for entering the spirit world and wanted to teach me a lesson.<BR>
<BR>
I tried to sit up in bed but I felt a very strong gravitational pull as I did do. Sort of like the force of gravity was making it difficult for me to sit up. But this did not scare me and I thought little of it.<BR>
<BR>
I looked around the room and everything seemed to be normal. Suddenly a powerful surge over came me. I instantly made a psi ball with my hands and tossed it at the wall. It tore a large hole in the wall which worried me because I feared that my landlord would find out and evict me. At this point I laid down and went back to sleep. What I didn't realize at the time is that I was never awake at any time at all. All of it was a very vivid clear dream.<BR>
<BR>
The next morning I arose and went into my kitchen to prepare my morning coffee. As I sat at the kitchen table a sight frightened me. It was my beloved house cat. She was laying on the floor still and lifeless, and her body was bloated. As I watched her lifeless body my heart was deeply saddened. I could only conclude that she must have drunk some of the Datura brew from the pot on the stove and died from it.<BR>
<BR>
Sadly I sat at the kitchen table for an hour when I noticed that my cat was changing shape. I approached closer and found that it wasn't my black cat at all. It was my black leather jacket. I am happy to say that my cat was fine and in good health. <BR>
I had no further effects from the Datura after that but I found it to be an unpleasant experience which seemed to have an evil connotation to it. I flushed the remaining Datura down the toilet and haven't tried at again since. I was grateful that I was alone because I believe if I had a sitter he or she may have panicked when I fell so many times and have me rushed to the hospital, and that would have wrecked my career. One thing is certain. Everybody's metabolism is different. I am convinced that the dosage I took would have most probably been lethal to someone else. My advice is to stay clear of this plant.<!--   End Body   -->

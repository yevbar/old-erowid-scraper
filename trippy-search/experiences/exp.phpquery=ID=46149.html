<!--   Start Body   -->


My girlfriend N and I went to Catalina for Labor Day weekend, and brought several bottles of wine, an 1/8 of weed, a gram of ketamine, and a 1/4 of mushrooms. We planned on shrooming Sunday, the 2nd of 3 days, but after realizing that Avalon's economy is a conspiratorial racket to keep tourists IN town and not allow them to explore any of its natural wonders, as we had planned, we decided to eat them on Saturday because we had already done everything there was to do on the stupid island.<br>
<br>
We'd been drinking moderately all day, and were sober by now, about 8:30pm, so we opened a bottle of white, and finished 90% of it without feeling much at all. <br>
At 9pm, I prepared about 2 grams into a tea with a coffee grinder, put the powder in a tea bag, and sat with N outside on the patio listening to Thievery Corporation and sipping tea. We also each ate a solid mushroom, probably both totaling no more than a gram. At 9:30 we began feeling the 1st effects. Let me preface by saying that I am quite experienced with mushrooms; I have done them probably about 30 times over the last 10 - 11 years. Nicole had a mild experience many years back, but it sounded like threshold level only from her description.<br>
<br>
We went back inside our cabin because we were both getting the coming-up-on-mushrooms-body-chills, and it was 50 or 60 degrees outside. N was not quite ready for a trip of this intensity. She was handling it fine, she kept saying that she wasn't feeling bad, except that she had a persistent discomfort in her stomach, and kept fanning her hands in the air and saying, 'Oh my God! WOW, OH my, oh my, OH MY GOD! Its so weird!' and then start giggling. I feel that I did a good job guiding her through it, keeping her calm, telling her to 'let go of everything. Breathe deep, try to relax baby, I'm here for you. It’s trying to show you something that might be contrary to everything you've ever believed. Just go where it takes you, its quite interesting and amazing isn't it?'<br>
<br>
'Yes,' she would, say, 'its so much more beautiful than I could ever imagine.' The mushrooms were very visual and colorful. I saw rainbows and fractal patterns in everything. I tried to give her a brief summary of the pineal gland, the so called 3rd-eye, and that it is a gland in the brain that throughout one's life, emits a substance (DMT) chemically related to psyocibin. She was receptive to this idea, saying, 'it shows you things you've always known but were never really aware of. The fact that your brain makes this stuff TOTALLY makes sense.' Well, not quite, but sure. She also kept tripping off of 'the two worlds,' of eyes closed, and eyes open.<br>
<br>
By now it was about 10:30pm.<br>
Music was on shuffle playing on my laptop, with the itunes visualizer turned on. I swear the laptop was tripping with us to because every choice it made was absolutely perfect. I kept saying, 'I have this!? What the hell is this!?' (Which might indicate that I was just tripping and EVERYTHING sounded good) N kept saying I was too attached to my laptop. This was because the music was my life force, I had to have the music. When itunes found something really perfect, I would listen to that artist for a while, waveringly pecking out a search on the first 4-5 letters of the artist name on my LCD lit, liquid Titanium laptop. The metallic keys looked so organized and perfectly aligned, especial with morphing colored light from the visualizer softly illuminating them. We listened to jazzy drum and bass, LTJ Bukem for a few songs, and then it randomly picked some other crazy acid jazz that I didn’t know I had.<br>
<br>
N kept giving me reports of her state, because I had indicated that we should keep communicating (and because I was concerned that she was finding her 1st trip shockingly intense.) She said she was just a bit confused, and everything looked so beautiful, but that her stomach still hurt. At this point I suggest she take a hit of weed to calm her stomach. <br>
<br>
'Yes!' She said. 'Being stoned would be closer to reality than this.' I had pre-rolled 2 joints beforehand, and as I was getting those from the cabinet, I opened a bottle of dessert wine called Belmuscato, because I know alcohol can take the edge off of a hard trip. Also while I was in the kitchen, I figured I needed to catch up, because my trip was very nice but totally mellow, so I ate another 2 grams of mushrooms. I shot gunned a big hit of the joint to her, and she said she couldn't feel any smoke, but she definitely exhaled a good-sized cloud. She said it tasted very fruity and she wanted to smell some unburned green weed. The Belmuscato tasted fabulous, and when I gave N a sip, she swallowed it, eyes bulging with pleasure.<br>
'Oh my GOD!!' She cried. 'That was the weirdest thing ever! I could feel it going all the way down and it was like I could see it the whole time too. Swallowing something is the weirdest sensation.' Ah, to trip for the first time.<br>
<br>
From about 11 - 12pm, my memory is very hazy. N stabilized, and was really enjoying her experience. I really think the weed helped her stomach, and I don't even remember what happened to the rest of the Belmuscato, I don't recall drinking it, but it disappeared nonetheless. We were really enjoying the music and our visuals and altered perceptions, and especially enjoying each other's company. As we were coming up, we were more distant, in our own worlds on our own trips, but by now I just remember a sense or complete and utter connectedness with her. We were on the same wavelength.<br>
<br>
We felt we should get outside, but after a quick attempt at making it through the courtyard and me wanting to pee in the fountain to 'join myself' with this beautiful object, we decided that we should go back to the room. We sat on the bed for a bit and lit some Nag Champa, and about 30 candles. That took us about 10 minutes because we kept getting lost in the dancing flame each time we lit a candle. I sat on the bed for a while, absorbed in sound, floating on an infinite geometric plane to the Dark Side of the Moon album.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the laptop gave me a low battery warning, so I pretty much dove off the bed across the floor to the plug. N came out of the bathroom from which she had just proclaimed, “don’t ever look at yourself in the mirror on muchrooms!” to which I  replied in amusement, “I know baby, I learned that one a long time ago.” Seeing me laying on the ground, with my stupid computer, N made a bed of blankets and pillows so we could be down there and be plugged in. The laptop is not very loud so to enjoy music you had to be pretty close. Some really psychedelic electro-house came on and I was off and away. I closed my eyes and ascended into the 4th dimension on a roller coaster of organic fractal patterns and wizard like thoughts about how perfectly harmonic the physical basis of reality is. I could see the vibrational patterns of the superstrings inside the heart of every sub atomic particle in my body.<br>
<br>
The next memory I have was going to the fridge again, probably about midnight, to get the expensive, other bottle of Muscat.<br>
<br>
'Look baby, we are in Alice and Wonderland right now, aren't we?'<br>
'Yes, totally Alice in Wonderland,' she agreed.<br>
'And I just found DRINK ME!' I said as I produced the bottle of late harvest Muscat.<br>
'I don't know if I'm ready to deal with liquid again,'<br>
'Oh my f*cking god baby, trust me, just try this one...'<br>
<br>
It was like liquid gold. It was the most precious chalice of elixir of life I ever knew was possible to exist. We sipped it so slowly that it lasted the rest of the night. Taking a gulp of this stuff would violate some law of the universe. It was that immaculate of a liquid. It exploded in your mouth and unfolded into higher dimensions and twisted around and melted into your very being. It was almost enough to give you visuals, taste/sight synesthesia.<br>
<br>
I know the night pretty much ended by 2, because I looked the next day and the music stopped at 1:30. For that last hour or so, we ended up naked on a bed of pillows and blankets of the floor, rubbing and licking and caressing each other and talking nonsense about how incredibly powerful and beautiful such a things as love could be. There were a few moments of clarity where I realized, 'look at us, look what we're doing, we are so tripping balls right now.' We dabbled in oral sex for a short while, but were too consumed in the bigger picture of each other’s beings to focus on single body parts. At some point I ate all the mushrooms. It might have been gradual or it might have been all at once. At some point I remember suddenly realizing that was chewing on a big cud of mushroom, and it was all fibery and chewy and must have been in my mouth for 10 minutes. I promptly swallowed it with a swig of wine.<br>
<br>
So the intoxicating substance tally was this: N had a total of about 2 grams, and I had about 5, including what was in the tea, and we drank two small bottles of dessert wine during the trip, and one normal bottle right before dosing. And we smoked a joint and a half. <br>
<br>
Yes. Definitely tripping.<br>
<br>
Overall it was a beautiful experience although I would recommend not drinking so much, as a large portion of the trip was hazy and usually mushroom trips are pretty lucid and clear headed, although perhaps not when you consume 5 grams. When I did the 7, I was pretty whacked out.<br>
<br>
N was falling asleep and I was still going pretty hard, but I felt like I was sobering up and wanted something to knock me on my ass. I stumbled around looking for a lighter, feeling like there were half smoked joints, half drank bottles of wine, and probably a cap or two lying around the apartment. When I couldn't find anything, (because in reality we had consumed all of it) I gave up on that. This is where I made a bad decision. I went for the K in the cupboard.<br>
<br>
Never mix ketamine, alcohol, and 5 grams of mushrooms. Don't mix ketamine with anything for that matter. I took a small bump, and then had second thoughts immediately afterwards and with the powder still dissolving into my nose, I blew it all out hard.<br>
<br>
'I'm pretty f*cked right now and I need to be really careful with this sh*t.' Thank God I at least had the wherewithal to blow it out. The small amount that did absorb hit me like a ton of bricks. I laid down and in about 5 minutes went deep deep deep deep deep into the inner mind. It felt like an eternity. I had completely lost everything, the concept of what a body was, certainly of who I was, and was it was to be a conscious human being. I was deep in a K hole. A shrooming K hole. Not awesome.<br>
<br>
I've never been in a K hole before, but this was definitely it. I remember having thought fragments of what I've read about bad DMT trips where you are falling through infinity with no reference point and total disembodied terror. I was on the edge of this, but somehow accepted my fate, so wasn't ever actually terrified. I can't say that I 'said' anything to myself, because the idea of an inner thought voice wasn't really possible in this state, but I instead felt, 'how bad can it be, give me your worst,' and thankfully it never really got there. I was more f*cked than I've ever been though, and it wasn't terrifying only because I accepted it, and I only accepted it because it was the only option of a thought I was able to have, if that makes any sense.<br>
<br>
A shrooming K hole is a very difficult experience to put into words. Words in an expression only retain their original meaning if the person receiving them has an experience to relate them to. This was an experience there aren’t any words for. I remember feeling like, “That person I used to be, the person who I walk around as, and who has a job and friends, is gone forever. I haven't been him for an eternity come to think of it.' I have done a fair amount of psychedelic drugs but this is the first time I ever actually believed I wasn't coming back.<br>
<br>
I've never had more than an 1/8th except for 1 occasion when I consumed 7 grams due to a tolerance built up from shrooming every weekend for 2 months. And that was great. The summer after graduating high school. Now I was on 5 grams after a year without shrooms, plus a bump of K, a joint and a bottle and a half of wine. Stupid stupid stupid. 'So this is how it ends,' I thought, 'I've somehow gotten myself here and this is what I am now, falling through infinity with no concept of anything but just, a void. The computer of my mind has crashed, and my consciousness is stuck in some kind of feedback loop. If I come back it'll be a miracle, and I don't even know what ‘back’ means.' Again this wasn't the normal voice you hear in your head when you think. That requires some kind of concept of an identity; it was just, a feeling. <br>
<br>
Normally a “thought” is a kind of voice in your head, an English speaking narrator that says things to me like, “Dude, don’t forget to put the toilet seat back down,” and, “I wonder what it would be like to like to do some K right now?” In this state, when a “thought” happens to you, it becomes the world you are in. You are the subject of the thought, instead of vice versa, you are “inside” it, kind of like a dream. Or the holo-deck of The Star Ship Enterprise.<br>
<br>
Low and behold I woke up in bed the next morning with N’s warm body pressed against me. I felt pretty groggy, but otherwise fine. Somehow she woke up late and got me up unto the bed. She said I never really woke up, but did as she told me and stood up and moved.<br>
<br>
'Wow', I thought. 'I had accepted that I was dead, or at least never coming back.'<br>
I didn't really tell her much about that part, just that I did some of the K and I got really fucked up and I shouldn't have done it.<br>
<br>
'You're crazy. You ate ALL the mushrooms AND did that sh*t?'<br>
'Yeah it was a bad idea.' I said.<br>
<br>
All in all, the trip was incredible, and I think that it was a valuable experience to know that I can handle such an utter out of body, mind obliterating experience, and that I accepted death without panicking. But I will never mix K with mushrooms again. In hindsight it was REALLY scary.<br>
<br>
This is definitely worth mention as well: The next day, N thought she had a few bug bites, there were 5 or 6 tiny red itchy dots around her body. We took a nap at about 8pm, and she woke up at 9:30 itching all over. She turned the light on and she had broken out in hives all over her body. That was Sunday, today is Thursday and they have almost gone away and flared back up again several times since then, but they are still bothering her. Our research indicates that in the rare cases of an allergic reaction to psilocybe cubensis, the hives happened right after ingestion, not 24 hours later. She hasn't been to the doctor yet but our conclusion is that they are stress based, the stress coming from the shock of the trip. She did say a few times when she was coming up hard and I was worried about her, that she was 'just in total shock.' I guess it was physical shock as well.<br>
<br>
Apparently another common source of hives is gastrointestinal distress, which, remember, she was also having for a while. So even though it wasn't a chemical allergy, she did get hives from mushrooms, so we think, because of a more psychosomatic reaction. She kind of went into shock at first, then mellowed out, and the histamines somehow accumulated 24 hours later. It's totally possible that it could be something else, but the more research we have done, the more it points to the shock from the mushrooms.<br>
<br>
Believe me, I really want to blame it on anything other than mushrooms, detergent in the sheets, something she ate, anything. I think that it won't happen again, she'll be accustomed to the effects, but I'm afraid to give her mushrooms. It might be impossible for her to ever try again because now it will be a “thing” for her and she’ll psych herself out and make it a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br>
<br>
No one else who has eaten these mushrooms has had any problem with them.<!--   End Body   -->

First off, some background. I'm only 13 (no comments please) and have tried a few of the typical things you would expect a child of my age to have tried (cannabis, salvia, Absinthe, DMX) and a few you may not expect (prescription codeine pills, nutmeg) so when a mate of mine brought a few bottles of poppers into school I wasn't shocked or anything like that.<br>
<br>
I got in a bit late as I had to talk to the head because I returned from my suspension that day and when I entered the classroom I instantly was hit by a strong smell which reminded me more of anesthetic than say glues or stuff like that.  I sat in the back and I asked 'What the fuck is that smell?' to which I was then told we had some poppers.  I was handed the bottle and got straight away to sniffing and was slightly surprised that I didn't feel it the second my head lifted, as I was used to after pot. So I sat up and went hmmm and decided to take three more strong sniffs...BIG MISTAKE! <br>
<br>
The second I put the bottle down after the forth strong snort was this huge feeling coming into my head and it seemed to be pulling my ears apart and my head felt like it was growing.  Then I realised I could hear rather than feel my pulse right underneath my ears and when I looked the teacher in the eye I couldn't help but laugh and fall over. Unfortunently then the next snorts came in and they made it extremely uncomfortable, my face was extremely red and my heart beat could be seen on the other side of my shirt. Also my lungs had that strange feeling that I get when I sway from side to side with only my top half, deflating them.  I began to hypervenilate and felt very dizzy.  I rather stupidly I thought that I had swallowed some as I had been told that swallowing kills, so I began spitting everywhere only to land myself in trouble and be sent out.  On my way out I think I banged into every desk and and the door and collapsed outside it.<br>
<br>
However once this odd feeling left it was very pleasant, a strong buzz.  I felt extremely talkative and talked to the teacher as my friend and felt quite untouchable.  We consequently did this for the rest of the day in obviously smaller doses until we had tremendous headaches and stopped for around an hour.  Then after school had ended we planted our selves in the park and opened a new bottle and took out the grass.  <br>
<br>
However the weed felt different this time, more visual differences than normal and it felt as if time was continuing around me and I was in a slower world, quite nice really.  After we had all finished we all parted our seperate ways.  The bus ride home was really good fun however I don't know if I can put that down to the poppers or the weed but the lights felt brighter and it felt like the chair was hugging me into it so I actually missed my stop and got off later as I felt to comfortable to get up.  The feelings of it all left rather quickly after that, faster than normal for weed, and I went back home and had a rather normal evening.  The only difference then was how long I slept for (16 hours) which was quite long for me but that probably just goes down to me using all my energy talking when I was on the alkyl during school.<!--   End Body   -->

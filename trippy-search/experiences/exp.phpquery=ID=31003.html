I cant write very posh or anything but I think that I have a few very valid points that hopefully will help people to not take ecstasy. <BR>
<BR>
I am 15 years of age and I had my first E when I was early 14. Straight away I started having it all the time, every week I would have at least 2 tablets. I would listen to peoples advice about ecstasy and ignore it if it was against taking it. I would listen to my friends advice about it being very good but that you have to be careful. <BR>
<BR>
after I stopped taking it every week, I realised that I had started to crack up. I had started to feel like I didnt know myself anymore, that I had changed and ecstasy had taken over me. I felt as if I was a different person, I would have mad days or moments where I felt more confident and happy, but really I was very depressed, at night I would feel depressed for absolutely no reason. I then calmed down on them and I felt a significant difference, I felt much more like myself and started to realise the danger of pills. My parents have never taken drugs and I am pretty decent at school, however since I started to take pills I couldn't concentrate on things as well, and I have got worse grades. The last E I had made me sure that I didnt want to take e anymore. it didnt feel as good as it used to, I didnt trip anymore. my comedown was unbareable so me and my friends decided that we would quit pills. <BR>
<BR>
I am glad that I have quit them now and I feel completely back to normal now. all pills do is mess with who I am. they can change my personality, not just my body. when I think of my experiences I can hardly remember anything, from what I can remember I get a horrible feeling. it makes me feel like life is shit, basically. now though I am cleaner than ever and I only smoke cannabis and get pissed. in the end pills fuck my head up. by the way pills are shit without rave. At the end of all this I am glad I had the ecstasy experience, I am glad that I have now worked them out, I am bound to take a few more in my life but now that I am experienced they will hopefully have no negative effect on me. just be careful because ecstasy can be a lot worse than it seems. :)<!--   End Body   -->

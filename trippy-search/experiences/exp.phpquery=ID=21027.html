Even as I write this at 09:32 I feel strange.  What an experience I had!!<BR>
My Salvia arrived yesterday.  5X Standardised extract, two grams.  Cool beans! I couldn’t wait to try it.<BR>
<BR>
9:00am: My parents have left and I think I might give my stuff a go.  My parents threw out my bong and I haven’t received my jet lighter yet so I will have to try it using an ordinary lighter and a pipe.  I don’t have much hope that it will work but I might as well give it a go.<BR>
<BR>
9:03am:  Pipe prepared, bowl packed (about 1/15th of a gram), sitting in my comfy chair.  I am ready to try. I expel all the air in my lungs, I light the bowl (holding the flame over the bowl for the duration of my inhalation) and I inhale deep.  I hold it and begin counting.<BR>
<BR>
By the time I reach 15 seconds I know something is happening.  I feel a knocking sound.  I don’t exactly hear it but feel it.  She has come, she is knocking, she says it is time to go??..<BR>
<BR>
The following narrative was written after the experience.  I have corrected the spelling mistakes although I will leave the words exactly as I wrote them, as with the punctuation.<BR>
<BR>
It’s time to go.  Everything, all the energy, every part, the grand design wants to take the energy that is ready into the infinite pattern of eternity.  It looks like a real pattern, I can only see a small part, but everything around me is integrating into the pattern.  I can see it and everything is unfolding but I am resisting.  I am preventing the proper formation of the pattern; she pulls me.  I feel the pull so strong.  But I am not ready, I don’t want to join.  I hear myself say,  ‘I don’t want to go’.  I repeat it, I try to tell the presence, whom I feel is the master of the eternity, that I am not ready.  She lets me go.  I stand but I am drawn back.  I take another hit.  I can’t help it.  She wants me to and I want to make her happy, I love her.  I return, but I still don’t feel ready to go, I am not ready.  She pulls me in because deep down I know that I want to go and she knows that I do; she knows everything.  <BR>
<BR>
I try to tell her again.  My words, I see them form in my mouth but I know that they are only movements of my lips and I have a doubt as to whether she can understand them.  She can’t, I will be trapped in the pattern, free in the pattern, free forever, but I cannot go now.  She knows I am not willing and I fear she will punish me, but she does not.  She understands and releases me.  I stumble around not sure as to whether I am part of this world or still tied to the pattern.  I AM of this world; I AM back, I AM Stevie G.  <BR>
<BR>
I then write what you have just read and go downstairs for a cigarette (I really needed one!).  I feel strange; I fear the knowledge of the pattern will drive me mad, I fear that I will never be fully part of this world again.  Once I finish the cigarette, I go into my living room to write the remainder of my thoughts.<BR>
<BR>
What I am left with as I return to almost full reality and write this now is deep understanding and a sense of myself and of my connection to this pattern.  It is comforting although humbling and awe-inspiring.<BR>
<BR>
Everything is linked, and all energy in the infinite space that is far beyond our world and our universe is tied together.  This world, Earth, our universe is merely a fold in the pattern.  A small piece of irregularity that is not yet in sync with the regularity of the tapestry.<BR>
<BR>
But I feel that when this world is over, when I die, my energy will become part of this grand design, the pattern.<BR>
<BR>
I can’t say whether the pattern is beautiful, I saw only a small part and even that was beyond my comprehension.  I was resisting, everything around me was integrating but I was trying desperately to persist in my joy of chaos and the randomness of my world.  I love my world like I never knew I did.  Yet I accept the fact that soon I will join and leave and become a part of what is truly infinite and it doesn’t scare me any more.  When I am ready I will be happy to join.  But not before.  I appreciate the chaos of my world and need to finish enjoying it before I am ready to leave and contribute to the pattern of order and infinity.<BR>
<BR>
Looking back at my experience, the strongest feeling was definitely the sense that I was resisting becoming a part of the pattern.  It felt like I didn’t belong, my strong sense of individuality that I have always cherished alienated me from the whole eternity of the design.  It was a very powerful and scary feeling at the time but I have grown to understand and accept my experience.  <BR>
<BR>
Forgive me if some of what I have written doesn’t make a lot of sense it was hard to describe and I was still feeling very strange when I wrote it.<BR>
<BR>
Okay, its 10:05 now and I feel almost back to normal.  That truly is an incredible plant.  I have read back over what I have written and it only does about 0.00005% justice to my experience, so much was left out because the words to describe it just don’t exist.  Respect this stuff and bollocks to anyone that says you need a jet fuel lighter.  I used an ordinary clipper and a pipe. Wow, that was cool.  Scary, but cool.<!--   End Body   -->

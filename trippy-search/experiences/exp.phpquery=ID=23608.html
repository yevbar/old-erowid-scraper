In the late monthes of the prior year (2002), 4 tablets alleged to contain TMA-2 (40mg) and small quantity of speed made their way into my psychedelic collection.  I say 'alleged' because, although  my source was undoutedly earnest,  I always remain speculative until every shadow of a doubt is depleted from my mind.  Moreover, my 'dealer' first showed me the pills and told me that they were TMA-Z and it was a similiar to a combination mescaline and speed. Given that he was tripping at the time he told me this, I gathered he was confused and probably meant TMA-2, based on my prior reading on TMA analogues and such.   The next day, after he had come down, he insisted the chemical was indeed 40mg of TMA-2 but also insisted it was cut with speed.  I do not know if in fact it was cut with speed although it would explain the long duration of my trips.   I mention all this because, I can not account for why the duration of the trips were so significantly longer than Shulgin's reports and reports of other psychonauts other than with the fact that my pills were either cut with some other substance ie speed, or the substance was not TMA-2 at all, although I do not know what substance it would be.<BR>
<BR>
All this aside,  I decided I would trip alone first.  Not many of my friends are adventurous enough to take new substances without first knowing someone else who has done it.   I trust my sources and reading enough, however, to take chances with new substances.  This was one of the situations were I would have to be a guinea pig for my friends.  I took the first capsule over Christmas break.  I was accompanied by my grrlfriend and two friends from my high school years.  Just before embarking to my comrade's cottage for the weekend  I swallowed the capsule, not expecting any noticeable effects for 2 to 3 hours.   My 'dealer' mentioned that was how long it took to kick in.   I figured since the car trip was an hour and half long and since I wouldn't have to drive, I would be okay.   <BR>
     <BR>
Unfortunately, our ventures took nearly two hours and since I am considerably smaller, less tolerant to speed, and had no food in my stomach,  I was feeling bottled up with energy, as if I was about to explode.   The second we convened in front of my friends snow covered cabin I jumped out of the car, unable to wait another second in the vehicle.  The second the cold air hit my face I felt much better.<BR>
<BR>
We went inside, warmed up and smoked a couple bowls.  My friends mentioned my eyes had gotten huge and I was beginning to feel mescaline like effects.   I have never done pure mescaline, but have eaten peyote,  TMA-2 felt the same as those trips, but more intense visually, with even more vibrant colors and patterning. CEV's were noticeably stronger than with mescaline.  Mescaline provide almost no closed eye visuals for me. It also felt decidely more euphoric, but this may have been the speed perhaps, if it was indeed cut.  I felt myself get higher and higher and hallucinate harder and harder.  I vomited once after drinking water, but the nausea was immediate and temporary.  <BR>
<BR>
Eight hours later I felt myself loosing control.   My friends were playing a game where 3 tabloid titles are read and 1 fake tabloid title is read.   The object is to guess which title is the fake.   This game disturbed me greatly as the titles seemed to get stranger, darker, and more perverse over time.   As the titles meandered from bizarre topics of mutilation and biological deformations to Barbara Streisand's sex life (I am not exaggerating)  I had to leave the room.   I went to the bathroom.  I did my usual meditation to calm down.   I splashed water on my face and went outside for some fresh air.  Returning when I couldn't distinguish the lake from hallucinations and went inside to avoid falling in,  I sat back down with my friends.  But the miserable game worked its way inside my head again and spent the next several hours walking between the bathroom and outside to keep my head straight.  I became paranoid that I was dying and convinced myself I was running spectacular fever.<BR>
<BR>
I haven't lost it on a psychedelic in quite some time and I am fairly expierenced.  But I knew I was losing it.  My friends were becoming concerned about my frantic behavior and the fact that nearly 10 hours had passed and I was not remotely sober nor was I showing signs of coming down. I tried to calm down and checked my temperature.  I wasn't running a significant fever yet I felt like I was on fire.  <BR>
<BR>
I had a percacet in the other room  and since I was becoming uncontrollably neurotic, I decided I would dose down, rather than locked up in a mental ward.   Once the opiates kicked in I calmed down, but continued to trip for 6 more hours before I passed out.  The next morning my pupils were still dilated for several hours after I woke up.<BR>
<BR>
Despite my expierence, I decided to give it another try.  Had I given up on LSD the first time I got a little startled or confused, I would have never ventured further and lost a number of life changing expirements.<BR>
<BR>
So after my brother took it with no ill effects (although it lasted equally as long if not longer on him)  I decided to give one pill to my grrlfriend and to take the other myself.    The effects were nearly the same as before, but as before  another psychotic episode set in after nearly 8 hours.   I tried this time to dose down with opiates.  But all I had was Hydrocodone syrup and opium.    Smoking O helped, but I was tripping too hard to take the long slow steady deep breathes it requires to get high nor was it lasting long enough.  I attempted to drink the syrup but it tasted too foul to go down.  Keep in minded,  I was tripping extremely hard at the time and I am a bit fussy about how things taste when I am tripping.  Opium tea was out, it would taste to bad to go down as well.  <BR>
<BR>
Somehow, during this time, my girlfriend managed to sleep.  I don't know how, but she is able to sleep on a lot of psychedelics, although I can't imagine sleeping on this.   At last, alone in the darkness of my apartment.  I got the wise idea to swallow a half  gram of Opium whole.  The second the bitter taste hit the back of my mouth I spit it out and ran to the bathroom to vomit.  I decided it was a sign and dosing would not be an option.  I would have to wait this introspective hell out.   This was the right decision and I made many valuable insights about my lifestyle and personal health.  nearly 24 hours later, my pupils normalized, but wouldn't get sleep for sometime.<BR>
<BR>
I doubt I will ever do this substance again.   Although, I did take a great deal of insight away from my two trips.  So I won't rule out further expirementation.  Mescaline and similiar compounds seem to be very hard on me both physically and mentally, despite claims that they are milder phenethylamines than 2c-b or 2c-t-2 perhaps. Because despite recent oppotunities to explore these compounds further, I have not been able to bring myself to ingest them.  Perhaps with time and experience I will return to them with better insight.<!--   End Body   -->

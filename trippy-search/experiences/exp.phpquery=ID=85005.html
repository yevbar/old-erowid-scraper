I began the day completely sober, and was offered 'Bonzai' by a friend, a herbal headshop blend which I believe to contain the synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018. This was my second time experimenting with this product, and though I did not particularly enjoy it the first time, I did not expect such an adverse response. I smoked roughly half a gram of the substance at once in a waterfall, which is a form of makeshift water pipe. I did not expect to react in what I can only describe as a seizure.<br>
<br>
Within two minutes I began to feel extremely disoriented and 'stoned', and in less than ten minutes the experience became progressively unpleasant. Confused, I walked to a bus stop intending to head home. I sat on the bench, at which point my arms and legs began shaking. I struggled to stand up to take bus fare out of my pocket, before realising I was unable to move my hands in such a manner to unzip the pocket. My legs then gave out and I fell back onto the bench, hitting my head off the glass backing. At this point the shaking was uncontrollable. Within moments, I was convulsing uncontrollably and hit my head repeatedly off the glass behind me. I was then unable to open my eyes, and fell to the ground, hitting my head again off the bench.<br>
<br>
On the ground, I was convulsing uncontrollably and hitting my head repeatedly. One could define the ensuing experience as tripping, though I had no vision. I believe I was in a state of semi-conciousness; I could hear the voices of everyone around me throughout, but could not control any of my senses. My thought patterns became very repetitive, hearing the same shouted phrases over and over, unable to respond. Within moments of my collapse, a friend rang an ambulance. I was still unable to control the convulsions or even open my eyes; all I could feel was my body unwillingly rolling around to a painful extent, which gave me the impression I had received permanent brain damage. I kept hearing the same shouted phrases in repetition, in my state of mind they seemed to be taunting me. Eventually, I could no longer hear anything. There was nothing but silence and darkness, I had stopped convulsing and believed I was dying. I've been told I was crying at this point, though I was not aware. However, this phase of darkness seemed to end as soon as it had begun, and I was back to convulsions and hearing the same repeated shouts. This was, most definitely, the worst moment of my life; the pure unpleasantness of this ordeal caused me to beg to return to the state of darkness and I wanted nothing more than to die.<br>
<br>
After what seemed like an eternity, the ambulance arrived, oddly along with a fire engine and squad car. The ambulance crew lifted me to my feet, and I was once again able to open my eyes, though my vision was heavily distorted. Once in the ambulance, I sat down and once again my arms and legs began convulsing. I was put on an oxygen mask, which I then realised I desperately needed. Upon arrival at the hospital, I was amazed to be able to walk unassisted. I was admitted to hospital at roughly 6pm, and must have smoked the substance around 4 or 5.<br>
<br>
By now, the worst of the experience had ended. My heart rate upon admission to A&E was in the range of 160-180bpm, and took roughly ten hours to return to normal. My vision took at least eight hours to normalise. The convulsions lessened slowly over the hours, eventually coming to a stop, though for reasons beyond my understanding I was never given anti-convulsants, or anything else for that matter. I left the hospital sixteen hours after admission, having had blood and urine tests, a lung xray and being put on a drip. Other than extreme physical exhaustion, having had less than an hour's sleep the whole night, I was feeling alright.<br>
<br>
Following this terrifying experience, I don't appear to have any adverse effects. I have been experiencing mild headaches and pressure in my head, though I can't distinguish whether this is from the drug itself or the multiple blows to my head.<br>
<br>
I am an avid drug enthusiast, experienced with cannabis, alcohol, MDMA, BZP, amphetamine, dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, codeine, mephedrone, diazepam and zopiclone, among others. JWH-018, however, is one substance I would recommend to none.<!--   End Body   -->

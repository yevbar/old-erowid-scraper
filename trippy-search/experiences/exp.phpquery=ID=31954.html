<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: 80 mgs of 2C-I is considered an extremely high dose, see 2C-I Dose Chart]</FONT><br>
<br>
At the time of this particular trip, I had done 2C-I at least 50 times, and had a brand new gram arrive in the mail.  You might say 'yeah right' about this dosage, and believe me, I never thought I’d be able to handle something like that, but read on. I've always dosed orally with about 20-25 mg and had wonderful trips every single time.  I'd also smoked it a few times, but found it to be sort of a waste because of the shorter duration of the effects.<br>
<br>
I had just gotten finished with classes for the day, and returned to my dorm room.  I had planned to dose, but for some reason I decided to smoke a small amount first, to get me started off.  I tapped a few little chunks into my bong (without any water in it) and sparked. I finished it off in two big hits, then drank about 20mg in some soda.<br>
<br>
For some reason, I felt oddly different than any other time I had done 2C-I.  It took about 5 minutes for the smoked amount to fully come into effect, but there was no body rush, no high feeling.  However, my vision was effected as if I’d taken my normal dose.  Everything in my sight slightly waved and shimmered. 'Oh well,' I decided, at least I dosed and it should kick in eventually.  So I waited for about 1hr, and I felt even more strange than before.  I still didn't have the high, but the visuals had vastly increased, and I often felt waves going through my body.  Still, not having the feeling I desired, and a whole night of nothing in particular to do, I took another 10mg, and waited.<br>
<br>
After about thirty minutes, I still felt oddly the same, but the visuals had increased even more, and the waves became more frequent.  I was perplexed to say the least.  Absolutely every single time I had redosed in this manner before had become almost unbearably intense.  I was certain the substance was 2C-I, as I have used the same source many times. That’s when I decided, this is it. I redosed a 3rd time, another full 20 mg.<br>
<br>
30 minutes later, I was beginning to feel very, very strange.  I still didn't have the buzz I knew and loved, but I felt an entirely different feeling altogether.  The room appeared wildly distorted, and waved and shimmered constantly.  The voices on the tv began to sound distorted also, like they were speeding up and slowing down occasionally.  I had come too far to quit there, so bravely (or stupidly, take your pick) I poured out another 20mg, and down the hatch it went.  After another 20 or 30 minutes, my roommate came in, and said I looked pretty rough. The closed eye visuals were phenomenal, with Persian rug patters and pictures of cats and butterflies.  The room was hopelessly distorted and moving, and sounds were morphing as well.<br>
<br>
The phone rang.  I brought my self to my feet, and was surprised at my still present coordination.  I was also surprised at my ability to talk, although slow and stuttering, and comprehend.  I was invited over to a few girls' room for pizza, and put on my coat.  As I left the room, I realized how incredibly hard I was tripping. I walked down the stairs without too much difficulty, and went outside.  I began to question my reality, as I felt like I was dreaming.  I was slightly dissociated from my body, and felt like I was floating a foot or two above my walking shell.  People I passed were talking, but their conversations sounded like alien gibberish to me. The orange lights lighting my path seemed to cast an orange tint on to everything I saw. The world was covered with rainbow-colored fractals that shifted with every step I took.<br>
<br>
I made it to the room, said hello, and proceeded to sit down quietly on a futon.  I ate a slice of pizza (I have never gotten sick while tripping, not even once), but had no appetite and returned to my spot.  I was still on my way up.  I melted into the couch, with the television being the only thing connecting me to reality (it is always an anchor for me), otherwise I would have lost it.  My body felt like cosmic silly putty, being pulled and squashed every which way. The rainbow fractals danced and flowed with the rest of the world, and I would be completely lost if I closed my eyes, the only thing bringing me back would be someone talking to me.  I absentmindedly poked a cut on my finger with my fingernail, and all of body, and all of the world reacted to my pain.  My ever-flowing vision changed direction and converged on the cut on my thumb.  An intense ringing blasted into my ears.  All of this went back to the way it was before the instant I stopped.  Then I peaked.<br>
<br>
I had the intense urge to urinate, and I forced myself to stand up.  As I walked everything became intensely flanged.  I felt like I was a robot, and every move I made was broken into thousands upon thousands of tinier movements.  My breathing and heartbeat were also broken into thousands of parts.  If I stopped moving, however, the flanging stopped, and I resumed tripping as I had been when I was sitting in the room. Every sound around me was amplified and distorted.  Coupled with the flange-effect, it was very disorienting.  I saw one girl holding a conversation with another, and her voice and movements were all completely normal, while the girl she was talking to sounded distorted and weird.  I could here the one girl over everything, perfectly normal.  I finally made it to the bathroom where everything swayed and shifted violently.  I felt like the urine leaving my body was emptying me.  The walk back to the room was the same as the first. I got back to the futon and sunk in, and things resumed as they had before.<br>
<br>
The trip continued from that point forward much in the same fashion.  I had dosed at 4pm, and the last time I looked at the clock was 4am, and could still feel the effects. I drifted into sleep with much tossing and turning, as I always do with 2C-I, and I had some very strange and vivid dreams.  I awoke feeling just fine, no hangover, no afterglow, just normal.<br>
<br>
I don't know why this trip was different.  I think it has something to do with the way I smoked beforehand, because I had started feeling different soon after.  It became very LSD like, and the regular ultra-intense buzz I usually experience never showed.<br>
<br>
I love this stuff.<!--   End Body   -->

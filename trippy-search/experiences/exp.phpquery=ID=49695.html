<!--   Start Body   -->


I started the night with two of my drug friends, Ben and Rob. We have done Mushrooms and LSD together before and decided to take the next step. I coocked up the ayuhuasca for us and we drank it around 8:00 p.m. My friend Ben was the first one to puke about 10 minutes after drinking it. Rob and I decided to have a contest who could go the longest without puking. Waves of nausea came and went. <br>
<br>
About 20 minutes after drinking the brew, the effects started to take hold. My body became very light and my consciousness was feeling strange. The effects began to really pick up fast and 5 minutes later i found myself hanging over the rail, we were outside at Robs appartment, dry heaving. I no longer felt sick and it seemed like the DMT was taking control and refused to leave the brew inside me. It was the most violent vomiting I've ever expierenced. <br>
<br>
I knew the brew had already left my stomach and was half way down the digestive track, but my body forced it all the way back up and it hurt. After I puked I felt awsome, as if i just droped exstacy, which I only did a couple times in my younger days. Then the trip came. It was very intense and I felt like if I really wanted to, I could walk right out of my body. <br>
<br>
We all went inside and sat on Rob's couch. The visuals were starting to take hold and I found myself in another reality. I then became very sad and felt like I was going to cry. Just then outside the door in the hallway, a girl walked by talking to someone and she was crying. She was saying how nothing she does is appreciated and she should quit. I then realized I felt her. That was the reason I began feeling sad, because my sense were so high, I sensed her presents before she even walked by the door. The vibe in the room was intense, no one knew what to do with themselves. <br>
<br>
I then stood up and went in the kitchen where Rob had boughten drawing paper and oil pastels for the trip. The box for the pastels was unopened, and opening them was a task. As soon as I sat down and started drawing a large wave of euphoria hit me like a speeding train. What I had drawn was swiming around the page and the light from the ceiling was rocking back and forth, as if we were on a ship at sea, even though it was still. I told the guys they had to come in the kitchen and start drawing because it completely changed my mood. <br>
<br>
We turned on a music channel, soundscapes, on the T.V. and everyone began drawing. We could all read off each others vibes and began having one of the most amazing times of our lives. The peak began to sank but before it did it came back and punched me in the face, like a reminder to never forget what just happened. 2 hours and 30 minutes later the trip seemed like a distance dream and I was back to normal. <br>
<br>
We then ordered a well deserved pizza because none of us had eaten anything 48 hours before the trip. I recommend this expierence to everyone, but do be prepared. I didn't like the vomiting part, but then realized it was part of the expierence. It's a cleansing process before going down the tunnel.<!--   End Body   -->

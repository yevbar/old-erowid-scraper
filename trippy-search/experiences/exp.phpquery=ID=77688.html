This is my second report about the 2C-C plus MDMA/MDE combination, where I have further refined the correct 'mix'.<br>
<br>
My wife and I had a bottle of wine with dinner, and as a result of that, I just about felt asleep watching a movie. Afterwards, she decided to go to bed while I started feeling more awake (not that unusual with me, the 'night owl' type that I am) and so I went to the other room and turned my second computer on. Having browsed through some political commentary relating to the Queensland (Australia) elections (which again confirmed, as if there were any need to do so, that the majority of the public is terminally stupid), I switched over to search for some interesting research chemicals. That reminded me that I had some stuff left over in the drawer here, so my mood improved immediately! ;-) Who cares about another 3 years of incompetent, corrupt Labor government, if you can get nicely stoned right here and now! :-)<br>
<br>
As by that stage it was about 11.30PM, yet again there was no time to waste by employing an oral route. Having sampled some of this mixture the previous night, I was confident I could go a bit higher with the 2C-C, as well as the MDMA - which, in retrospect, perhaps was not really MDMA. We suspect that most likely this was actually MDE. So I weighed some 40mg of 2C-C and just over 60mg of the 'MDMA', put that on a spoon, mixed up and in the vein it went.<br>
<br>
A few seconds later, I experienced a very nice, warm rush, with the computer screen in front of me blurring into rainbow colours and starting to move in a wavy fashion. I could no longer read the text, but I felt a little horny, so I switched over to some porn sites. However within a minute, the second compound must have hit the CNS (interesting that there is such a delay?), and my extremities got rather cold. Furthermore, while I was still tripping nicely and the room was full of swirling colours and had taken on the appearance of a nice, safe, dark coccoon, the penis had already decided that it was time to go to sleep. :-)<br>
<br>
By this stage the first, rather sexual, rush of the 2C-C was over (and I must say here, the IV rush of this compound tends to be *very* sexual when used on its own!) and I started to feel very contented and relaxed. I did feel that had my brother or another close person been around, it would have been nice to cuddle up together - not to have sex or even to talk, but just for the tactile/body contact. This is in contrast with straight, ordinary MDMA, where I typically feel chatty and love everyone. Here, I was happy and feeling I could love someone, but considering the circumstances, I could not be bothered going out of my way to find someone to love. In many ways though, I felt I had hit the 'sweet spot' - that's how nice and comfy it was.<br>
<br>
Normally with E, I would have at this stage probably gone to bed to snuggle up to my wife, but here I just could not be bothered about anything. I spent the next half hour or so idly browsing through some porn sites, but I was not feeling sexually excited any more - it was just something to do. Anything would do at that stage, really, and it was nice to look at some pretty female bodies. In fact, I found I gravitated towards erotic sites, rather that hard porn - the body rather than the intercourse.<br>
<br>
By this stage my brother got back on line, so we exchanged a few e-mails. However this was about 90 minutes or so into the trip and I was starting to feel sleepy. I therefore put another 20mg of 2C-C into the spoon, coupled with 30mg of the 'MDMA'. A very, very nice rush was to be had, but no specifically sexual undertones at all this time around - just some fairly significant brightening of the computer monitor and even more relaxed feelings. So I turned the machine off and went to bed (this was just after 1 AM). Within another 15 minutes, I was fast asleep, to wake up at 8 in the morning, fresh as a daisy (that is, after a nice, strong black coffee - which is the normal morning ritual with me!).<br>
<br>
So, to re-capitulate: This is, all in all, a very worthwhile combo. I would like to try to mix 2C-C with MDMA pills (obtained from a source where I can be certain they are what they are supposed to be), for a comparison test. This 'crystallic MDMA' felt too different for that, and I speak from some significant experience when it comes to IV-administered MDMA! ;-)<br>
<br>
This is definitely not a party/rave combo, and while different people would obviously be affected differently, I do believe it would be nice to do this with one or two close friends, where the expectations are not to talk too much (or not at all), but just enjoy each other's company and closeness. Snuggling up in bed next to someone close would have just topped it off, I think. My guess is that having other people around would take away the sleepiness to some extent- a bit like what tends to happen when several people use opiates/heroin together. It then just evolves on to this little time capsule, totally and utterly devoid of external world's interference and just filled with love and contentment. In other words, the little, internal world, where you can safely say 'Depression? -- What depression? Who cares...? Funnily enough, I reckon this could be a worthwhile combination for heroin afficionados. The sedative aspect of it cannot be underestimated.<br>
<br>
I have to say here also that I am lucky in that (unlike my brother) I feel no uncomfortable body load from the 2C-x compounds at all. Having IV'd 2C-I and 2C-C, they both have their unique characteristics, they are both worthwhile compounds, each on their own and mixed with other things, and they are both, at least for me, very benign.<br>
<br>
A 2C-E test is coming up next; hardly anyone has IV'd that one yet (at least based on what I can find on the net). I'll keep you posted! ;-)<!--   End Body   -->

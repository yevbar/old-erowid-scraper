It was a boring night so my girlfriend and I decided to dose some foxy for the first time. We had no scale so we eyeballed the pills...later to find out we took about 30+ mgs. It came on slow taking about an hour or so. Then i could notice something was definitely coming on. I went ot use the bathroom and while there noticed the floor starting to move and shift. Then the light became very vivid and even started to flicker. <BR>
<BR>
After returning to my basement(bedroom) I was getting more and more diconnected from reality. Both me and my lady just sat in silence. Our bodies felt like they were seizuring and we could not stop moving around. This went on for about 2 hours, then we started to exchange some words but they made no sense to either of us. We would constantly lose track of what we were saying and could not keep a train of thought for more than a few seconds. Our sentences would literally end with a blank stare. <BR>
<BR>
We went outside at about 4 hours into the trip, which was a mission in itself. Everything felt surreal. The visuals for me however took an awkward turn when I used the bathroom again. My trails were SO strong that when finished going piss it looked like I still was. Also since my body was trembling and surging so much I couldn't tell if i had stopped going when putting my hand in front of me. That added a state of paranoia to my night. I thought I was pissing all over the place and we were both just to fucked up to notice! <BR>
<BR>
About 6 hours into the trip we KINDA started to come down. We could communicate a little better and we discussed with each other what had been going through each others head the whole night. The entire trip lasted about 10 hours, my visuals remained strong for the first 8 and the body trembling was just strong enough to keep me awake through the next day. I will say it WAS an experience, I had never in my life been so confused as to what was happening to me. It was not as described to me and therefore caught me off guard, so it wasn't the greatest experience but I suggest that if you're a fan of hallucinogens, try it. I've since then done it 2 more times, and since now i know what to expect the trip are more fun and interesting. <BR>
<BR>
All around its a good drug, and the visuals are great with a dose above 20mgs. It's just one of those drugs were EVERYTHING melt, moves changes color, grows, shrinks and everything else in between. I hope anyone who battles it wins and goes on to enjoy its day of legallity. Peace!<!--   End Body   -->

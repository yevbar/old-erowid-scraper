I figured that my overall opiate tolerance had completely been obliterated, since it has been six months plus since any opiate use.  I picked up a 40 mg Oxycontin for $30 (a rip off), but I simply had to see what it was like.  I went home from the buy at about 7 pm.  At 8, I figured it would be good to take.  I crushed the pill as completely as I could, and just put it in my mouth and swallowed.  I had told myself I would do 20mg maximum, but I figured I might as well go all out, and I calculated the odds of ending up in the ER or morgue were low, especially with stimulants on hand if needed.<BR>
<BR>
I was hit fast, in about ten minutes.  I started getting a warm groggy feeling that washed over me.  It was not at all unpleasant, and I was trying to stay on the computer the whole time.  After about 20 minutes, I just gave up and lied in bed, expecting to drift off to sleep.  Instead, I learned the definition of a nod.  I will describe it as best as possible.<BR>
<BR>
It's an area between waking and sleeping...it feels like just before you go to sleep, when you often start to dream.  Thoughts rush through your head, and often times I wondered whether or not I was awake or asleep, but settled upon the former, since I was able to think at all.  I did not want to open my eyes.  <BR>
<BR>
Every thought was carefree, I know I was not worrying at all.  They weren't really coherent, it just seemed to skip from thing to thing.  I know I liked it, because I didn't try to sleep until about 4 am, since I was supposed to get up at 7.  I also know it DEFINITELY kills pain, because I had a knot on my head about the size of a tennis ball from an accident about a week back , which I remember NOTHING about, but my friends drove me to the ER...apparently I lost a fight with a coffee table.<BR>
<BR>
Anyways, be very careful with this drug.  It has some real power.  I would really advise less than 40 mg, as this really knocked me off of my ass, and I still had a semi-buzz the next day.<!--   End Body   -->

To tell you a bit about myself, I'm 17, at college, and don't have much to worry about in life as of yet. This experience was about a month ago, when me and my friend, who we'll call Johnson, discovered salvia experiences on the internet. I am a complete newbie when it comes to drugs, especially psychedelics. I've had the usuals; tobacco, alcohol and am a frequent smoker of pot, I love the effects of MJ.<br>
<br>
Back to the point, I wanted to make sure I knew what I was getting myself into, so i read the experiences. From what I had seen on the internet, I was ready for a fully involving, 3-dimensional dream, and because it was legal believed that I had nothing to worry about. I hadn't seen a bad experience. I smoke cannabis, that's illegal, how bad can this be?<br>
<br>
I sleep at Johnson's house, and I'm very excited to try it now, so the next day we go to our local smoke shop and they have three types of salvia, 5x, 10x, and 15x. I'm saying 'Let's get the 15x!' Johnson replies 'No, we don't have a clue what to expect yet.'. I just wanted to make sure this legal smoke did something. I was stupid, Johnson has some sense, but from the experiences I had read about, I didn't think anything would go wrong. We settle on the 10x. Later on in the day, we both go to mine.<br>
<br>
We waited for my parents to get to sleep, and then we decided to go for it. My mindset at this time is 'Give me some Salvia! I wanna go to dreamworld!'. Needless to say, i was in a very good state of mind, but unaware of what the true effects would be like.<br>
<br>
Johnson decides to go first, so he lights up the pipe for his first hit, holds it in for 30 seconds, then blows it out. As he does this, I see the extract is still burning so I grab the pipe and smoke the small amount thats left, only a miniscule amount. I ask him how he feels, 'Doesn't do anything!' is the impatient reply. We put more in the pipe for his second hit, he smokes it, and again, there's extract still burning, so I smoke the remains while he exhales. I wait with anticipation for his reaction. He still doesn't feel anything and we wonder if we've been conned. I turn the lights on to put an even larger amount in, and everything seems to have a blue tinge to it, I believe I was on level 1.<br>
<br>
Third time, he smokes it all. Nothing again. Getting impatient now and really want to test it for myself, I'm so excited to feel the effects I believe I will get. We still play it safe and use the same amount, but this time... WHAM! It hits him while the smoke is still in his lungs. I could immediatly tell it had hit him, his facial expression just changed to 'out of it'. 'Exhale!' I remind him. He forgot he had it in his damn lungs! I ask him what's going on and he talks about being on a hill with me at the bottom. 'C'mon Jim, come up the hill with me!' Oh man! This is gonna be great!<br>
<br>
I keep the lights off and look at Johnson for a minute, it was as if his mind was elsewhere, so I load up the pipe for my hit, I can't wait to get to this 'other reality'at this point, it sounds amazing! I step up to the window in my room, light the pipe, and smoke as if having a bong hit. The salvia seems to burn so easily, I manage to fill my lungs full of salvia smoke, and begin counting to 30. I get to 25, then it hits me hard. 'Whoa... what's going on...' I feel like I'm extremely stoned, but only for about 10 seconds. In this time, i turn to Johnson on the bed 'Hey! Something's happening! ............What the hell?!?' MMMMMMMMMMMFFFFFFFFFFF!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
I am immediatly transported to another reality. I hear voices, spirits, even though hear is not the correct word, because I no longer have ears, or a body for that matter. I am well and truly, completely, out of it. This does not compare to anything. I don't know who I am or where I am. I have lost all my senses, yet I'm still there, and I know I'm there, but now there is a whole new depth to everything, that cannot be sensed when inside the body, as if we do not have the sense to pick this information up. I believe I was dead. I had lost my senses and gained the feeling of what it was to leave the body.<br>
<br>
I could hear these mystical spirits now, they were mainly above my window and at my door as this was happening. They were angry because I had opened up a void I was not supposed to know about as of yet, and opening this void was going to be the end of everything, the universe, unless it was corrected. The wall, the floor, everything, seemed to contain these as I can only describe as 'after-life' beings. This was more real than reality itself, and I am certain however crazy I sound that the universe as we know it would have all gone through the void if it was not corrected.<br>
<br>
The correction of the void was done in an extremely complicated manner, it is impossible to accurately explain how they did it, because it was way too complicted, this reality had so much depth, but I'll give it a shot. They were replacing fragments of reality where the void was, and the main reason the void opened was because I was not in my body when I was supposed to be. My actions had led to the slight change of how everything was meant to run in the future. Me leaving my body was not supposed to happen and would have a slight change on how the world was to run, and this was, put simply, not meant to be, but had somehow happened, so the mistake had to be corrected.<br>
<br>
The spirits managed to guide me to my body. It was like being a baby brought into the world. I was brought into the spirit world and had no idea how to control myself. I was at the window out of my body 'level 1', collapsed onto the bed 'level 2', rolled over my friend 'level 3', three more rolls 'levels 3, 4, and 5'. I was almost inside my body, i could feel it. I was going to roll again, 'NO!' was the immeditate sensation i got from the 1000s of spirits, angels, whatever they were, in my room. They were definitely there, no doubt. I was guided into the correct position that my body was in, and was back inside.<br>
<br>
I was in my body, the biggest relief ever, but now the floor opened and I was being pulled with my right leg through the floor to hell by an unknown force. I held onto my bed for dear life. I thought I would be this way forever. By this point I knew I had smoked salvia, but the effects seemed like they would never end. After what could've been between 1 minute - 1 week for all I knew, the grip got weaker and I returned to my regular state.<br>
<br>
Johnson was tripping at this time, so couldn't act like much of a sitter. During the process of being pulled to hell, I heard him say 'This is well good, isn't it?' I now realised he was in the room and also believed he was having the same experience, and could not believe he was enjoying fighting for his life.<br>
<br>
I later learnt that Johnson could see me even though he was tripping. He said that I told him something was happening, then collapsed onto the bed, having muscle spasms and getting myself into a strange bodily position. I was not in my body when all of this was happening. I left my body when it collapsed, and ended up nexto the window. To get back into my body I collapsed onto the side of the bed nearest to the window and rolled to the other side where it was. The spirits helped guide me into the position I was supposed to be in to re-enter my body. This 'out of body experience' part was where most of the crazy stuff happened.<br>
<br>
I believe that what happened was as real if not moreso than reality as we know it. It was easily the weirdest and most terrifying experience of my life, but also the most fascinating, and so I have no regrets. Johnson enjoyed his trip and said his experience was like a dream, but more real. This was absolutely nothing like mine, I must have a small tolerance for salvia. <br>
<br>
I warn you that it is possible to misuse a substance you believe you know plenty about. Be very careful how you use drugs, treat them with respect no matter how soft you belive they are. I've now heard it may be scheduled in America, how I wish I knew this before I abused it.<br>
<br>
Sweet dreams!<br>

I first heard of poppy tea online a few months back. I had recently ran out of my supply of hydrocodone I got for some oral surgery. Hydrocodone was my first opiate expiriance and after three months, my bottle of 40, 10mg lortab was gone. I had tried poppy seed tea three times before and felt nothing but tired and got headaches every time. <br>
<br>
I bought 30 golf ball sized papaver soniferum pods for ten dollars online. The stems and pods were still green too. I crushed one and measured it at aprox. 1 tsp. I ground the rest and measured out four teaspoons. ( 4 pods ) I added a tsp. of lemon juice, let it soak for ten minutes then added a quarter cup of water heated to about 130 deg. farenheight and let it steep for 20 min. I strained it through a fine wire filter then put the pulp in cloth and strained that. I used the small number of pods to test the potency so I would'nt O'd. I drank it down and It tasted like crap. After about 30 min. I started to feel very relaxed and felt the familiar warmth throughout my body. I laid on my bed and watched austin powers, feeling very content and nearly falling asleep. <br>
<br>
My friend called and about two hours after taking the tea went to his house and played GTA: San Andreas. I was pretty relaxed the rest of the night and was happy that I had got some good pods. The high wasn't really strong but still good. It was probably about as strong as taking 10 mg. of hydro, but I need about 20-25 mg. of hydro to get really messed up. <br>
<br>
After the successful test, I decided to take seven teaspoons and let it soak in 3 tablespoons of lemon juice over night, add hot ( not boiling! ) water and let it sit a couple more hours. I used the same filtering method and added a tablespoon of sugar. This is how the night went.<br>
<br>
7:30 pm drank down the awful brew on an empty stomach. The sugar made it bearable. Put in the Led Zepplin dvd.<br>
<br>
7:55 feeling relaxed, sinking into couch. Still waiting for the effects to kick in all the way.<br>
<br>
8:35 Mind slowing, thinking of complex things not possible. starting to feel warm all over, verly relaxed, mild euphoria.<br>
<br>
8:45 Damn, at one with the couch, moderate euphoria. I feel the waves of warm rushing through my body. Noticing little things in music I didn't hear before. Watching Led Zepplin jam for 20 minutes on dazed and confused, amazing performance. I feel great.<br>
<br>
10:00 drink tea with 3 pods in it when the high hits it's peak. I play GTA: vice city and listen to Pink Floyd. Just driving around not doing missions. I'm driving really slow not caring what I'm doing, just grooving to the music. <br>
<br>
12:10 starting to come down, still feel slightly euphoric. Mild body high still there. I turn on Princess Mononoke and watch some. I pass out around 1:30 and wake up a few times feeling like the movie is real. cool. I slept like a rock the rest of the night and had no hangover the next day. I did feel A bit fatigued though. A great expiriance overall. <br>
<br>
The only negative was a very strange one. The first hour and a half after drinking the tea, I had to piss like some one who drank a liter of coffee. I got up to piss about 5 or 6 times. It was strange, when I had taken hydro, it would have the opposite effect, I would get urinary constipation. Bizzare. why would it make me need to pee? I was mildy itchy but it wasn't bothersome. Hydro makes you itchier and is more sedating.  Be safe, respect the pod.<br>
<br>

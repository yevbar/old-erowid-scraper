When I discovered that Tramadol can be purchased without a prescription I was very curious to try it; I enjoy opiates a lot and wanted to see what this 'opioid' thing was all about. My previous experiences include opiates such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, opium, codeine, and heroin. <br>
<br>
I really liked this drug but it was different from what I expected. Starting with 187mg I moved on to around 200-300mg a day usually in two doses; this seems to be optimal for me, as higher doses only increase the sedative effect and not the euphoria. For me, Tramadol takes a long time to fully come on. It also seems to have an antidepressant as well as a 'pseudo-opiate' effect. The antidepressant-like mindstate becomes apparent about 40 minutes after ingestion, while the pain relief and the nodding and zoning that comes with it only hit me around T+1:30. This does not seem to vary with stomach contents. [Note: I took the brand with 37.5 mg Tramadol and 325mg Paracetamol so this may be the reason for slower onset]. <br>
<br>
It also seems to kind of come on in waves, first I’m completely zoned out on a wall then I suddenly 'wake up' and can walk around doing chores or whatever I have to do quite efficiently. Definitely a more 'workable' high than heroin and oxycodone once I get used to it. My favorite part about it though is the very positive outlook on life which reminds me a little bit of heroin. Long duration is also a plus, as I can easily go a full day on it without feeling tired or burned out. <br>
<br>
My least favorite part is the horrendous constipation and the unsettled stomach (farting all the time is no fun). Overall, the experience lasts around 12 hours, with the opiate-like effects disappearing after 8 hours or so and the positive post-effect stays with you for about 3-4 more hours after that. Opiates always give me this sort of a 'soul filled with darkness' melancholic feeling while Tramadol is a much lighter, sociable high.<br>
<br>
Combinations:<br>
<br>
I've tried several combinations and found that Tramadol combines well with many substances.<br>
<br>
A combination with amphetamine/methamphetamine does not give me the 'swing' effect where I constantly go either 'up' or 'down' but rather provides a very stable and very euphoric feeling. After the amphetamines wear off it is easy to sleep too, making it ideal as a come-down aid as well. <br>
<br>
A combination with benzodiazepines produces a 'kick'. Barbiturates increase the effects in a similar way as benzos do. <br>
<br>
Weed, needless to say, goes great with Tram, as does 5-HTP. It seems to directly increase Tram's effects, very similar to taking an additional dose.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I find Tramadol to be a very enjoyable high which is easier to work with than opiates though it comes up short on the body buzz effects that one gets from Oxycodone, for instance. I try not to do it very often though as it is definitely very addictive.<!--   End Body   -->

dosage:see story<br>
<br>
Well the long wait was over.  It had arrived, my jwh-018, and a long wait it was. I received a gram of off-white yellowish powder.  As I understand this is the appearance that you want, as opposed to a rust colored lump that others have been buying on the internet. <br>
<br>
A friend and I decided to try it out.  I could not find a proper vaporization (meth) <br>
pipe so first I improvised with a light bulb based vapor pipe.  I took a tiny amount <br>
of the powder and put it in the bulb.  I just stuck the tip of a knife in and got as <br>
little as I could.  i took 1-2 hits and blew out very little smoke as did my friend.<br>
 <br>
It took aboubt 5 minutes to start affecting us noticably.  The effects were identical <br>
to smoking very good marijuana.  I was not extremely 'high' per se but the effects <br>
were unmistakable.  <br>
<br>
We followed up by smoking roughly the same amount on foil.  this worked much better <br>
but it was difficult to get it to that point where all the smoke releases at the <br>
same time in a big cloud.  We got pleasantly baked.  After we were already high and <br>
hit the foil again we could notice a rush right when it hit us. the buzz lasted for <br>
about 1.5 hrs.<br>
<br>
4 hours later I went to another friends house and were gonna get good and blasted this <br>
time we did a few foil boats and got extremely high.  It lasted about an hour for me <br>
but was extremely pleasant.  I'm sure i went over the 5mg dose recommendation and <br>
I did not have any sort of paranoia or 'bad place' type feelings.  All and all it <br>
went very well and the only thing I am going to do differently in the future is get <br>
a vaporization pipe rather than that nasty foil.<br>
<br>
Its not for everyone as the method to smoke it is a difficult learning process that <br>
is more for the harder drug user.<br>
<br>
In closing I think that milder forms like Spice are probably better if one <br>
plans on smoking it for a long time (probation).  But for the price per use jwh-018 <br>
is unbeatable.  In the future I plan to use the proper pipe and I am going to try <br>
oral dosing dilluted in grain alcohol.<br>
<br>
Side effects: munchies, red eye, short term memory loss, telling stories no one <br>
wants to hear, cottonmouth, and telling stories with no point. Hope this helps.<br>

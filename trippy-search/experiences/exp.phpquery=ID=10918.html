It was friday, and I called up a friend to check what we were going to do tonight. We were gonna smoke hash with friends. I did not eat anything from about 15:00, and did some sporting around 18:30, and took a shower. This way my body would be 'clean'. I did this because I heard it could increase your experiences when using mushrooms, so I decided to try it on hash. It turned out to be Good.<br>
<br>
At about 21:00, me and 5 other very good friends sat down at a picknicktable somewhere along a road. We rolled the joint and started smoking it. I am usually very sensitive to the effects of cannabis and it extracts, but we shared the smoke, so I did not really have much. I just had my usual stoned-experiences, until after somewhat half an hour, I saw pretty pretty pretty visuals! It was like all the patterns I ever knew and could recognize came to me, before my eyes, in one dancing and all-knowing stream of purple, deep green, deep blue and beautiful yellow.<br>
<br>
This lasted for about 45 minutes of very intense, and an hour of less intense visuals. I felt the stoning effects for a very long time. When I looked in a mirror about 4 hours later, I still was stoned as hell, and could see myself from outside myself, I saw myself as others saw me. This was slightly spiritual. I also felt very close to my friends during the whole thing, seeing some situations as 'photo-moments', perfect describings of good-friends-life.<br>
<br>
I also ate a whole lot of chocolate, because of the supposed MAO-inhibitors in it, to see if my experience would change. I could not sense any change because of it. My mindset was very good, because I was with very good friends. I did hot have any alcohol at all for 2 months, and no cannabis for 1 month.<br>
<br>
In a whole a good result!<!--   End Body   -->

This report is going to be a little sketchy, as I can't quite comprehend the various things that have gone on in the last 24 hours, but suffice to say that my 'research' with these chemicals will have to come to an end.<br>
<br>
The previous day from about midday on Saturday, I had taken about 200mg of 4-MeO-PCP, a chemical that I had become familiar with and had been using to enhance Binaural beat mp3s with limited success. This Saturday was no different with some interesting visuals while meditating with the headphones on, but well short of the desired effects of a possible OOBE or remote viewing, abilities which supposedly are possible under the Hemi-Synch programme from the Robert Monroe Institute.<br>
<br>
Frustrated with the lack of success with Saturday's experiment, I took some 6-APB, or Benzo Fury, a yellowish powder, on Sunday morning. 70 mg, at about 9am, put in a glass of water in 2 batches, 20 mg first, then the rest 1 hour later. <br>
<br>
I had set up my playlist to include Gregorian Chants, I-Doser tracks and some Hemi-Synch lessons, but by about 10am and no real effect from the 6-apb I took 80 mg of 4-meo-pcp as I had run out of the 6-apb. Another hour later and still no effects I took another 80mg of 4-meo-pcp. <br>
<br>
4-meo-pcp I am familiar with, 100-200mg gives a dissociative effect for 4 hours, peaking from 2-3 hours, and is not particularly strong. Speech and movement are slightly impaired, with headphones and Binaural beats on, some dark red/yellowy images float past, either flowing patterns, or images from scenes involving landscapes and people I don't know. I was hoping that with continued use I could more easily master the CD programmes and at the very least induce an OOBE, but I was not convinced that this particular chemical was up to the job, hence my purchase of the 6-APB to see what it could do.<br>
<br>
On the Sunday morning that I took the 6-APB, it was new to me, but the limited reports on its use suggested a mild experience. What I didn't take into account was that it was a much longer come-up, and lasted longer, so my mistake in getting impatient and taking 4-MeO-PCP to top it up was entirely self inflicted.<br>
<br>
Times from here are estimates, but at about midday I felt that the concoction was starting to have an effect. So I put the headphones on and started to listen to Gregorian chants. All was well for about an hour, until the I-doser came on, and I took the headphones off vaguely aware that something was wrong. Although I will struggle to explain what exactly happened over the next 8 or so hours, what seemed to be happening was that I was having a full blown Salvia trip. I have taken 60x Salvia before, and the distortions in space and dimensions were unmistakable. I even had the taste in my mouth which reminded me of Salvia. I had only taken the 2 RCs as described above, but Salvia is the closest I can come to comparing it to. Only this trip went on and on and on. With a heart rate over 200bpm for pretty much all of it. <br>
<br>
Some of the symptoms that I remember; I took some coins out of my pocket and they seemed huge in my right hand, until I put them down on the table to my left where they seemed more like normal size. I couldn't quite figure out if was alive or dead, or what the difference was. I realised that if I was dead then people would miss me, but otherwise the 2 states seemed the same. At one point I was considering the state of 'being in love' with someone, and couldn't comprehend the emotion, we are all connected anyway, so how could we focus on just one person like that? It seemed like a mental illness. Dimensions didn't make sense, I could make my way about in the 3d world, but more from memory of how it was supposed to work. Where everything was and how it was arranged just didn't make any sense. At one point, while listening to music I could close my eyes and find myself in a yellow cube with writing on the walls.<br>
<br>
All through the trip, time was distorted, which reminded me of my only other trip on San Pedro. There, time simply sped up 2x, so films and music simply sounded as I'd expect them to on 2x speed. But here, it was more like frames were missing, so that everything sounded normal but choppy. the sound of traffic in the distance sounded like San Pedro, slowed down and condensed, but close up it felt more like skipping every other second. I would see someone in the garden sat down, but the next frame they were over there setting up the barbeque. I had no recollection of what happened in between. <br>
<br>
At various points I toyed with the idea of calling an ambulance, as I had no idea how my heart was coping with the sustained barrage. It held out, and I remember thinking what a good heart I had, and how lucky I was to have her, and that I really should look after her more. <br>
<br>
Another odd thing which happened was that I found myself asking Jesus for assistance in guiding my trip before it went bad, and asking him to look out for me. In the midst of the later chaos I saw the point in Christianity and converted, or at least promised to do so later. I can't now remember why this was, so I'm not inclined to keep the promise, but maybe the point was that I am not going to find what I'm looking for on my own with these chemicals, maybe something more structured and wholesome would suit my needs better. I'm not an atheist, but converting would have me paying lip service to things I 'know' cannot be true, so I don't think that I'll be going down that path.<br>
<br>
I managed to get to sleep in good time about 10pm, but on waking for work at 6am I was not much better. Heart still racing, mind still not quite getting the 3D world. Really not feeling well.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, this research experiment either shows that 6-APB and 4-MeO-PCP combined replicates Salvia, or, due to the time dilation reminding me of San Pedro, that this combination somehow replicates all past trips and borrows from them to construct an artificial experience. My only 2 previous notable experiences were in there somewhere, alongside reports of 4-MeO-PCP effects such as yellow images and seeing through closed eyes - it's like I can see a different kind of energy from my hands or from people walking past with my eyes closed.<br>
<br>
Predominantly, though, the trip was a Salvia trip, despite not having taken Salvia for some months. I will not repeat this experience, and not be taking any more RCs or plants again. Too little and no effects, too much and I get very sick. Other people make these Hemi-Synch / Binaural beat meditation programmes work naturally, I will try this route myself from here.<br>
<br>
In the notes section for the Hemi-Synch programmes, Robert Monroe says that you should not take drugs to enhance the effects, as anything you achieve will not be worthwhile unless you have done it from your own efforts. He is probably right.<!--   End Body   -->

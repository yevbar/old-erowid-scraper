ther I was with a 1.1 oz. can of nutmeg in my hand and a grin on my face. I had just swiped it from my moms pantry and was making my way up to my room. I sat in front of my desk and opened the can and took off the tamper evident seal. my heart throbbed with anticipation as I accidently puored more than half of the horrible tasting stuff down my throat. I gagged and heaved but managed to keep it all down. <BR>
<BR>
it was 4:30 and I was really hoping for an immediate high like on alchohol or weed. at 5:00 I started singing familair tunes but making up lyrics as I went along. it really sounded dumb. my mon even told me to shut up. my little sister came into the room to play with cards. we played go fish and I started to feel a little more sane. maybe it was just anticipation that made me so deleroius. I ate dinner at 6:30 and had not felt the effects yet. I was starting to get a little edgy. at 8:30 I felt a little more alert and aware of my senses but didnt really take it into consideration. I fell asleep at 9:00 wich is earlier than usual. I didnt dream at all and it became a more and more restless sleep. <BR>
<BR>
       I woke up at 2:30 and I was so nauseated and my head felt like it was floating slowly from side to side like I was underwater. I started to feel panic. what if I had taken too much and I was going to die? I walked down the stairs to my parents bedroom and hoped they could help me feel better like they knew how to when I was a little kid. everything was going too slow and my face felt like it was on fire and iced over at the same time. I finally reached my parents bedroom, walked through the dark and shook my mother awake. I started describing to her how I felt and told her I thought that I was going to pass out. I was really getting scared. then I dont remember what I was saying. I was stumbling over my own words and probably saying nonsense. that was when I passed out.<BR>
<BR>
         I dont know how long I was out but when I came to, the lights were on and my mom and dad were standing over me telling me to stop goofing off. I was so fake. it was like TV and I was just the viewer. I stared into my moms closet mirror and made faces and laughed at them. I felt so delerious about everything! at about 3:00 I went back up to my bed and propped my feet up on a pillow like I learned in Boy Scouts. (if the face is pale, elevate the tail; if the face is red, elevate the head) I fell peacfully asleep and woke up at 6:00 to get up and get dressed and go to school.<BR>
<BR>
         my dad was fixing eggs and bacon and my sister was already eating. I sat down to eat with her she started talking and I started laughing. I couldent stop laughing and I was getting iritated at myself for not being able to stop especially when there was nothing to laugh at. I laughed for what seemed like 5 minutes. my dad even slapped me attempting to knock some sense into me but it didnt work. I kept laughing throught the pain.<BR>
<BR>
       my dad drove me to school and I honestly tried to keep my composure but everything that happened was just funny. when I got to school I still couldnt keep my composure. from 1st period to 4th period it got worse. during lunch, some wannabe potheads told the resource officer that I was high. they took me into the office and did a pen check. I dont know if I passed or not but I told the officer that I was dehydrated when I woke up and that accounted for the blood shot eyes. for lunch I had 12 chicken nuggets 2 helpings of fries and 2 bisquets. in 4th period I got sent to the office for non-stop talking and got a saturday detention.<BR>
<BR>
       all day I had memory lapses, cotton mouth, bloodshot eyes, uncontrollable laughter, and the munchies. I never really had any recognizable visuals or hallucinations. when i got home I did my chores and ate a huge snack of 2 bannannas and 3 pop-tarts.<BR>
<BR>
        that night I slept like a baby and when it was time to get up I was tired and had a hangover. all that day I still felt dizzy but it didnt interfere with my normal life. I think that the reason I passed out that one night was because my mom gave me a perscribed sleep pill and that mixed with the NUTMEG. since then I have tried nutmeg without similar effects. 3 days later I got sick and had the flu. I dont know if it had anything to do with the nutmeg but i was really suffering.<!--   End Body   -->

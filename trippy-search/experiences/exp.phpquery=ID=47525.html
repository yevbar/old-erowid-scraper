Introduction/The Plan:<br>
<br>
My friend Andrew was coming down to my college for the weekend.  Long ahead we planned that we would do some magic mushrooms.  I had done them about eight times before this time and Andrew none.  So I wanted to introduce him to this fantastic experience.  On Friday my friend picked me up my ¾ an ounce of shrooms.  Obviously we were not eating them all that night. Consumptions were:<br>
<br>
Myself: 1/8-1/4<br>
Andrew: 1/8- one half of 1/-8<br>
<br>
<br>
The Beginning (8:00-9:30):<br>
<br>
I was in one of the greatest moods ever.  My good friend who I haven’t seen for awhile had arrived the day before and we had a great night on Thursday.  Now it was around 8:00 when my friend Dane arrived with the ¾ ounce of mushrooms and a friend.  We had to wait for his out of town friend to arrive at about 8:30 and then we munched down.  Andrew started with probably a little under an eighth while I started with a little over an eighth.  The other 3 consumed their amount.  After that we put in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.  I started getting some patterning and bright coloring.  My laugher greatly increased although I did have an upset stomach which was bringing me down at the time.  After about a half an hour of the movie we decided to go uptown to the rugby house and smoke a joint and we got ready and left.<br>
<br>
Uptown Lunacy (9:30-11:00):<br>
<br>
We left the room and now I started to get the breathing effects and some 3d patterning on walls and so forth.  I could feel my mind starting to stray from normal though.  Andrew was not feeling much at all at the time.  I told him in due time it will come to him, everybody is different.  We left the room and began walking up town and the visuals were pretty good.  Buildings began to breath and seemed to look almost like toy buildings and car looked like RC cars.  When we reached the Court Street I was a little uneasy with everyone around.  Dane, who had taken a good amount of mushrooms, seemed to be off in his own world.  I was stumbling here and there feeling somewhat awkward.  <br>
<br>
Finally I was very happy to reach the rugby house where we decided to light up our joint in the back.  It was pleasing and relaxing while smoking it and I got some great visuals of trees breathing and bending while we chilled in the back.  I could feel the effects starting come on more as my brain strayed constantly into blank stares are objects morphing.<br>
<br>
After we finished we decided to walk back to the back way away from people.  So Andrew, Dane’s friend, and I walked the back way while the other two walked the same way we came.  As we walked back it was more peaceful, it was quiet and we were free to talk as we pleased.  Unfortunately I was not happy to hear Dane’s friend was not doing so hot, but he seemed like an experienced tripper so I didn’t really worry.  Once we reached my room again I felt this overwhelming relief, I just seemed to feel very at home when we got their.  Once in the room and settled down I realized my trip was starting to take a more drastic leap.<br>
<br>
The Coming Up (11:00-12:00): <br>
<br>
Once back at the room Fear and Loathing was still on so we continued to watch up.  Andrew was talking about how he was starting to get some good effects and I was starting to really go off.  The room started to go off with rapid changing colors and patterning.  Objects started morphing constantly into each other and patterning was all over.  I recall putting my hands on the carpet and then they became pixilated and disappeared into the ground.  I realized that this trip was starting to get stronger then any of my other previous eight trips.<br>
<br>
My mind started to become that of a mindless child as I would rub my hand on the carpet or my other hand getting ridiculous sensation from any touch.  I wrapped my arms together at one point and it felt as though they became one object and I no longer had two arms.  Finally at around 11:30 the other two finally arrived again and we watched the Stewie Griffen Family Guy movie for a little, I barely paid any attention at this.  During this time Andrew had the bag of mushrooms and kept convincing me to take more and I finally did along with him.  I took about another half of a 1/8 to a 1/8 and he as well took the same amount.  Then around 12:00 Dane’s friend wanted to crash and so the three decided to leave and we waved them off.  The second they closed the door I looked at Andrew and the real journey began.<br>
<br>
The Great Journey (12:00-4:00):<br>
<br>
Once they left the room I looked at Andrew and him at me and we both went “Wow!” and at this moment my trip went to that final level, that final plateau that can be defined as total loss of visual connection with reality. The senses ceased to function in the normal way. Total loss of ego. Merging with space, other objects, or the universe. The loss of reality became so severe that it defies explanation. The earlier levels are relatively easy to explain in terms of measurable changes in perception and thought patterns. This level is different in that the actual universe, within which things are normally perceived, ceases to exist! Satori enlightenment (and other such labels).<br>
<br>
The room was out of control right now.  Not in a bad sense.  Pixilation everywhere, visuals coming left and right and no real objects seemed to exist anymore.  Colors all over, the visual world was ending as I knew it.  My mind now went to a state much like a mind on LSD, but there was not as much sporadic confusion and overload of information like an LSD trip.  I could barely control my body or do any movements without stumbling or falling over.  I was touching everything, bed rails, sheets, my lips, my pants.  Everything was amazing.<br>
<br>
At around 12:30 Andrew decided to put on the song High Hopes by Pink Floyd and right when that song came on I was grabbed and pulled out of reality for the rest of my life.  I was standing in the middle of the room when the music came on I feel to my knees and then to the floor and the world vanished around me.  I no longer had any control over my body and the life purely became the music.  I could feel, taste, see, live, and be the music.  I was music as I knew it.  The visuals led me through universes and all sorts of weird places.  Thoughts of time, perception of reality, thinking, and life passed through my mind and I was making unreal realizations that seemed to make sense to me.<br>
<br>
As the song peaked music vanished, the world vanished, reality vanished and life became black with one white orb in the center and it stood still for what seemed to be 20 years.  I felt a sensation of peace and wellbeing that I had never felt before as I was just there in darkness with this white orb in front of me.  Finally I snapped to reality and I could barely make out Andrew who was looking down on me with the same reaction on his face.  Throughout most of the night I would touch or cling onto certain objects like a blanket, futon, or laundry bag and feel as though I became part of the object or object would melt and mold around me which was very cool.  We both began to talk about our experience and understood each other in every way.  A sober person would have probably been spooked out by our actions but everything made sense to both of us.  We felt a special bond that nobody could experience except for us.  We were taking the journey together the whole time and whenever we left this place we felt each other’s aura or so it seemed.  This happened for most of the night.<br>
<br>
I was all over the room falling, touching, and laughing while music was playing.  The room was the music whenever I wasn’t torn out of reality.  Andrew and I made many realizations about time, thought, life, and other various things.  There seemed to be no time, it seemed we had been in this world for years together, doing any sort of action such as eating or wanting to go to the bathroom was near impossible because our thoughts would stray else ware, to complete a simple task could take anywhere from 30 minutes in real time, but what seemed to be days in our time.<br>
<br>
It wasn’t like LSD where my brain is being overloaded with information and I am just completely out of control.  On mushrooms I was just constantly thinking and everything was beautiful and enjoyable, visuals were some of the most beautiful things.  I saw what I thought was a Temple of God and then I saw life.  This continued until 4:00 where we entered a different state.  One of the scariest things that shocked me was I looked at the clock and it said 2:00 then two minutes later it was 3:00.  I swore that only two minutes had passed since I had looked at the clock.<br>
<br>
Utter Confusion (4:00-5:00):<br>
<br>
At this point we had gotten to our beds and the world was still visually out of control and my mind was still straying all over, but it did seem to be coming down as music was not taking us out of this place anymore.  We sat and talked for an hour, but what really seemed to be 5 hours.  We talked about our trips and our thoughts and realizations on all qualities of life.  Much of it was nonsensical but we understood each other completely.  Finally the music went off and we tried to sleep, it took sometime as I was still getting good CEV visuals and questioning thoughts kept running though my head but I finally fell asleep.<br>
<br>
The Morning (Woke up at 3:00):<br>
<br>
The next morning we woke up and I felt an overload of confusion and my brain felt fried.  It seemed to feel cooked after last night.  Andrew and I began to talk about how we felt and talk about last night for most of the day as it was constantly on our minds.  A trip of that sort doesn’t simply pass.  My body and brain just felt simply overworked and it was hard to function and be motivated to do much during the day.<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
<br>
This was my 9th trip on magic mushrooms and after this trip it took the cake for the best drug around that I’ve tried so far.  This trip smashed my two overwhelming LSD trips.  Tripping with a friend in that state seemed to be the best bonding experience I have ever had in my life.  We understand each other and nobody but us knew what really happened that night.  My experience with music was amazing and I cannot name a better feeling then what I felt when I was listening to the music.  I enjoyed simply leaving this place and losing reality going off into my world for what seemed years.  Although the morning after you can be quiet confused you still feel a sense of well being and peacefulness.  In due time I am planning on taking as much as I had took that one and leaving this world once again on another mystical journey.<!--   End Body   -->

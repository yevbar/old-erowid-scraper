<!--   Start Body   -->


First off, I am a recreational Marijuana smoker and am currently on Trileptal (300mg) [an antiepileptic] twice a day an Paxil (20mg) once a day.<br>
<br>
The Benzedrex Inhaler was acquired at a CVS pharmacy. They keep them behind the counter but I don't know if there is an age reqirement to purchase them. The top of the inhaler screws off like I was supposed to eat the cotton inside or something. I was kind of leary of the idea of eating cotton, however since it is already saturated in the Propylhexedrine it is quite easy to consume if torn into pieces.<br>
<br>
After consumption it took me a while to be able to keep a straight face because of the horrible taste that came with acid reflux. The burps were bitter and almost nuaseating. After drinking a Mt. Dew and smoking a few cigarettes I began to start getting a tad giggly, like after smoking maybe half a bowl of decent weed. The more I moved the more I seemed to become intoxicated. The high peaked with odd bursts of energy and then climbing back down from stoned to sober at a faster rate than it climbed. After I thought I had sobered up and was feeling a tad fatigued I sat with my mom and chilled out in the living room to read. However I was still talking a mile a minute and fidgeting.<br>
<br>
Id say this experience lasted for about three and a half hours. That night however I had horrible sleep. I went to bed at eight pm, woke up wide awake at one am. I could barely go back to sleep at close to five am. Upon waking at six am I was still disoriented.<br>
<br>
The next day I had a constant headache, but no blurred vision though. The headache was bearable, but I still had to take a few Ibuprofen to stand school. It wasnt a dirty high like I have experienced with other OTC medications. It's one I definatly would like to experience again to fully understand it.<!--   End Body   -->

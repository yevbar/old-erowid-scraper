This friday I put myself through quite the binge, and it was both amazing and hellish enough that I thought I'd write about it.<br>
<br>
Here's what I consumed (I'm just gonna put down the estimated times now so I don't have to worry about them while I'm writing the story):<br>
<br>
-=FRIDAY=-<br>
7:00pm - 1 glass of wine<br>
9:00pm - ~20mg 2C-B (oral)<br>
11:00pm - smoked some grass<br>
11:59pm - smoked some grass<br>
-=SATURDAY=-<br>
1:00am - 1 pill MDMA (oral)<br>
2:00am - 1 pill MDMA (oral)<br>
2:30am - ~7mg 2C-B (insufflated)<br>
3:00am - ~10mg 2C-B (insufflated)<br>
3:30am - smoked some grass<br>
4:30am - 1/2 pill MDMA (insufflated)<br>
4:30am - 8:00am - smoked lots of grass<br>
8:00am - 5:00pm - tried to sleep, no luck<br>
5:00pm - 7:00pm - hid from society<br>
8:00pm - 11:00pm - drank 3 beers<br>
-=SUNDAY=-<br>
12:00am - smoked some grass<br>
1:00am - finally got some sleep<br>
<br>
Let's Start Trippin'<br>
<br>
I had made plans to take some 2C-B with my friends T, F, and D. Only T was around so we dropped our caps without the others. First let me just say before y'all ask, I didn't have a scale to weigh things with that night. I don't recommend eyeballing chems to anyone, but I happen to have an eye for precise measurement and I have my ways of making sure the doses are safe and reasonably accurate. I routinely impress people with my precision, but I understand that mistakes are possible. So... 'don't try this at home'.<br>
<br>
<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: A volume amount of one powder doesn't necessarily weigh the same as the same volume of another powder. For substances active at such a small dose, eyeballing is particularly unwise. See <a href="../psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.html">related article</a>]</FONT><br>
<br>
Anyway, 20mg down my hatch, and about 35mg down T's hatch. Note that T is historically resistant to the effects of 2C-B, and most people probably shouldn't eat this much.<br>
<br>
2C-B always takes a long time to come on for me when eaten, and when my girlfriend, my buddy W, and some other people came by after a night of drinkin' about an hour and a half later, I was just starting to catch the buzz. Soon afterwards F and D came over and wanted to do some 2C-B. I divided about 30mg into three tiny lines (they wanted to snort it), suggesting that they each do one line, wait 20 minutes, and then decide if they want more. But F accidentally blew two of the three lines in one sniff. If she were an inexperienced tripper I might have worried, but I can't really think of anyone who can take more drugs than this girl, so I just laughed. D sniffed up her line and we went outside for a ganja smoke.<br>
<br>
Outside we met up with the rest of the folks who had just returned from drinking. W in particular was pretty drunk, having just drank 80 oz of malt liquor in the last couple of hours. Actually, he entertained us trippers for the next hour or so by jumping into the snow, setting off car alarms, and best of all, making prank phone calls across campus. By the time he was making prank phone calls and accidentally telling people his own phone number, I was on the floor holding my sides in laughter!<br>
<br>
And by now I was probably peaking on the 20mg of 2C-B. The buzz was very enjoyable and there was a strong euphoric push, very much like mescaline. Visuals at this point were mostly bright colors, floor tiles patterning, wood grain crawling, and other effects that you might expect from a low dose of LSD. Actually I find 2C-B's visual effects to closely resemble LSD, but be nothing at all like 2C-I interestingly enough.<br>
<br>
At some point the idea of taking some MDMA came up. So we went back to F's place where myself, my girlfriend S, T, D, and F each ate a pill. We chilled out here listening to music and talking for a while.<br>
<br>
The transition from 2C-B to MDMA was subtle but most excellent. 2C-B resembles 'rolling' in some ways: There's the euphoria, the empathy, and the excellent buzz. So I gradually transitioned from one happy state to another.<br>
<br>
Probably an hour later I ate another pill of MDMA. I don't really remember doing this, but I'm quite sure that I did.<br>
<br>
One hour after this, probably about 3:00am, everybody is rolling pretty hard and sitting up in a cozy bed together talking about god-knows-what. It was around this point that it occured to us that some 2C-B would be nice. So we made the trek back and cut out about 7mg for each of us to insufflate. I didn't want to wait for an oral dose, and I also wanted to be more efficient with this precious chemical. Plus F and D thought snorting the stuff was the way to go.<br>
<br>
*Sniff*... well that didn't burn badly at all. Except for T whose nose was apparently partially clogged. But then again he always complains about how bad things burn. We all went over to my girlfriend's room, which is full of bright colored tapestries and trippy lights, and sat up on her bed. The 2C-B was kicking in fast, but there was no anxiety or nervous feelings at all. In fact, it manifested itself in the form of the best buzz I have ever had. Also my vision looked like I had eaten a strong hit of LSD a couple hours ago. I felt like I was on the edge of breaking through into something, but not quite there, and everyone else agreed (except S who hadn't taken any 2C-B). So we each decided to do a slightly larger bump right away.<br>
<br>
*Sniff*...<br>
<br>
I had heard that MDMA + 2C-B was just about the best drug combo possible, and now I saw why. I was washed over in euphoria. No drug or combination had ever felt this good. The visuals easily rivaled my most intense LSD visuals.<br>
<br>
In addition to the 'usual' swirling, morphing, crawling, and rapid color changing of objects, I had an additional layer of vision. It was much like the transparent screen in the movie Minority Report. This transparent screen was right in front of my eyes, and displayed incredibly sharp and detailed psychedelic imagery mainly in the colors of blue and yellow. WOW. No real insight, no real mindfuck, just euphoria and beauty.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong though, I was completely retarded by this point. I wanted to go play guitar for a while, so I did. Each note sounded really beautiful and meaningful, but several times I forgot that my amp was still on, and that I was holding a guitar. I guess at some point we all decided to rail half a pill each.<br>
<br>
*Sniff*...<br>
<br>
Honestly I don't know if that did anything or not.<br>
<br>
I went to use the bathroom and the whirring of the exhaust fan sounded like 20 different voices talking to me at once. This was a little strange and I was glad to be done with my piss. I'm not usually fond of audio-hallucinations.<br>
<br>
We sat outside for a smoke and I watched the snowy hills shrink and grow, the trees dance around, and the earth change color.<br>
<br>
We all went over to D's place and smoked a ton of herb, and we were all still rolling and tripping pretty well. I guess the 2C-B lasts for about 2 or 3 hours when you sniff it. At this point I'd like to fast forward to the comedown. Mine was allright but my girlfriend was having a hard time with hers, and getting really emotionally distressed. Let's just say that her emotional crash brough me down HARD. Imagine falling from heaven to hell. So at about 8:00am it was time for me and S to get back home and call it a night.<br>
<br>
Walking back home was one of the sketchiest things I think I've ever done. We both looked like crap, and I was paranoid as hell. I took a short cut back to my house to avoid people, and thought police were following me back to my house. We finally made it inside with much relief. Then I helped S regain her emotional stability, and everything was pretty much ok. Then we had sex for a few hours...<br>
<br>
She slept allright but I didn't get any sleep at all that whole day after, so I was like a paranoid zombie the next day, which really sucked. I then experienced the hardest crash I've ever had from any drugs in that day and the next couple days after.<br>
<br>
-----------------<br>
But hey, I was an idiot and partied like it was 1999, forgetting that it was 2004. I don't do long binges like this often, and I don't plan on it again any time soon or even not-so-soon.<br>
<br>
BUT... 2C-B + MDMA is the shit!<br>
<br>
Afterwards I had only one serotonin left, and it was very lonely, but there is none more amazing of an experience. Hippieflipping is like packing a lip of chewing tobacco compared to 2C-B + MDMA. Seriously.<br>
<br>
Allright, if y'all have any questions you know how it works.<br>
<br>
peace!<!--   End Body   -->

I thought I'd drop this note about a caffeine related hallucination(?) I had a few years ago.<BR>
<BR>
Myself and my best friend, A, Used to regularly get a bit spaced out on caffeine and generally run around doing silly things. As I had an espresso machine, we used to go back to mine and have a few double espressos. There's probably still a couple of head prints in the upstairs ceiling at that place...<BR>
<BR>
One evening we decided to camp out in A's conservatory and stay up all night to listen to the tribal gathering on the radio (Tribal dance music stuff -- pretty cool). It was very much a spur of the moment decision, as most of them were. We decided that in order to stay up all night we'd have a bit more coffee than usual and eventually thought 'What the hell' and took a couple of pro plus (caffeine pills) as well. Sat in the conservatory, we were talking about garbage (as we often do) listening to the radio when A went to get a drink and left me for a few minutes. I was just sat listening to the radio, feeling the beat of the music when suddenly it hit me.<BR>
<BR>
We sat with the conservatory blinds drawn and I couldn't see anything from where I was sitting other than the interior of the conservatory. I grew convinced that there was nothing outside. Nothing at all. The universe ended on the other side of the blinds. Although this sounds scary I felt completely indifferent to it. I just sat there, staring at the edge of reality while the music filled my mind. In fact, I felt quite content with my tiny universe. Suddenly A came back with a couple of cups of tea and I woke from this weird trance. It had seemed like he was gone hours, but he'd only really been gone about 5 minutes. We laughed at my little 'panic attack' if you can call it that, although I was still feeling mildly paranoid. I wouldn't regard it as a bad experience. It was interesting. Very surreal.<BR>
<BR>
I've had a few similar experiences and even a couple of mild visual distortions since (only from ridiculously high doses) but this was my first. Caffeine trips are almost always fun and I find that my more random thoughts can be quite inspirational. I've written lyrics and even whole songs while spaced on caffeine before.<BR>
<BR>
Thanx for letting me share,<BR>
Take it easy.<!--   End Body   -->

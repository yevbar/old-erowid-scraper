Substance: 2-ME-DMT<br>
Experience: 1st Time<br>
Setting: At home, Alone<br>
Administration: Nasal, Oral<br>
Gender: Male<br>
Age: 19<br>
<br>
<br>
22:34 <br>
<br>
Snorted a small line to see if this stuff works nasally and perhaps works better this way. Doesn't burn badly but it is felt. I'm talking on msn and I'm basically in a good mood. Drip just started. Ewww Burns! This stuff has a horrible burning drip much like DPT. I drink some water and have a ciggarette.<br>
<br>
22:47 <br>
<br>
Effects are noticed. Distinguishing between sobriety and the drug it's effects now. <br>
The effects are coming on gradually now and I am waiting to see how much stronger it's going to get before I take more. Come up is felt but very light and so not bothering me at all. Psychedelic feeling. Possibly feeling warmer. Pupils are dilated.<br>
<br>
23:02<br>
<br>
Decided to ingest the rest of the 100mg in a gelcapsule. Snorting this stuff isn't exactly pleasant. The sensation is pretty much like every other tryptamine at a low dose. Undistiguishable from other tryptamines. Stronger effects need to be reached to be able to explain better what is unique about this substance.<br>
<br>
Watched some movie on tv for a while to see if I liked it. Nope. I don't like scary movies.  A light psychedelic feeling with no character of it's own yet is felt. Listening to some music. Thinking about the future and humanity on earth. I am worried. <br>
The substance is making me care more about the situation of natural disasters than my drug use. The beautiful music goes along with it perfectly. I want to help. I don't know how. That's where my thought patterns lay now. A more serious mood developed. Talking on msn again now.<br>
<br>
23:55<br>
<br>
Are we getting stronger effects yet? I feel a tactile sensation through my head. Chills. As I am thinking about concepts I perceive more insight in my thought patterns. Possibly more abstract. Chills continue through my head. A positive thing is that I haven't felt any come up feelings yet. And the experience of course is positive. Enjoyable but not strong. Not a trip because I'm still here.<br>
<br>
00:13 <br>
<br>
Starting to feel the tactile sensations through the rest of my body. Mainly through my head. Colour difference is observed. First visual activity. Coming on stronger now. <br>
Mood improving. As lucidity comes. <br>
<br>
0:36<br>
<br>
I keep smiling the whole time. I feel chills and cold. I turn up the heat. One person that was sober that I was talking to on msn noticed effects I believe. Through telepathy. All the other people who I talked to were high on other things so no way to be absolutely sure. Tactile sensations is what I experience for the most part. I feel chills through my whole body. I am happier now than I was before I took this substance.<br>
<br>
1:18<br>
<br>
The trip itself isn't strong enough to keep me busy. I'm still capable of doing all the other things I usually do. I laugh and have fun. But perhaps need something to do. This drug might require a higher dosage to achieve full effects. I don't know what brain receptors this drug effect but something in my brain that regulates my temperature may be affected.<br>
<br>
2:00<br>
<br>
No increase of effects. Either a higher dosage is needed or this compound is boring.<br>
<br>
2:47 <br>
<br>
Nothing is changing so I don't write anything anymore. That's about it for this substance. It's not worn off or anything yet but I just don't have anything to add. I'm just talking on msn and listening to music. It's a good mood enhancer though. Like almost every other psychedelic. NO visuals. But almost. I perceive everything that is of matter as spirit. The substance that everything is really made of. But yeah. Every psychedelic does that.<br>
<br>
3:41<br>
<br>
Still going. I notice the chills are gone now. Don't know for how long they've been gone. I don't miss it.<br>
<br>
5:26<br>
<br>
Yawn. I ate some fruit. The drug helped me by making my mind more lucid. It was a positive experience but not a real trip. I'm getting more tired.<br>
<br>
6:00<br>
<br>
Effects are still present but I'm going to try and get some sleep. I think this drug might be useful for those who want to explore telepathy further but if you're looking for a real trip I recommend a different substance.<br>
<br>
Good night<!--   End Body   -->

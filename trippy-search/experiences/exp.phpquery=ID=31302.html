The powder I recieved was pure white (not off-white, brown or that oozy black shit). <br>
<br>
I took Ethacetin HCl once before (dose ~10 mg, nasally insufflated) and not a lot happened. It burned my nasal passages really badly and made my eye tear. Not a lot happened visually or mentally. At the time I was coming down off of a mushroom trip, so that might have had something to do with it. My 10 mg Ethacetin HCl experience was a +1 on the Shulgin scale. I could not sleep although I was fairly tired going into the 'trip.' I just lay in bed and after many hours started to see minor tracers from moving objects and some patterns forming in maroon color just in the air. That was it.<br>
<br>
Now, to the report at hand... Early in 2004 (Jan), I took 30 mg Ethacetin HCl orally in a cup of water. The taste was pretty bitter. This was to be my second 'trip' with this particular substance. It took about 30 minutes to take effect. I noticed a little bit of stomach discomfort for a short while, but it didn't develope into nausea or anything. I started noticing a change in conciousness as friends and I watched TV. About an hour later I was peaking. There were mild but observable tremors all throughout different parts of my body at different times (quite reminiscent of what happens to me on DPT HCl) - shaking, etc.<br>
<br>
I began to see amazing imagery on the ceiling and floor.  Patterns, fractals, etc moving about. Swirly circles of lines formed all across the ceiling. It was visually pleasing. I had a bit of introspection that had me fretting the current circumstances of my life, but I found this introspection not particularly meaningful (although it could maybe have been directed into something meaningful). The show we were watching was about some high up government agency chacing what I could only conclude were drug dealers, although I wasn't quite clear.  I kept thinking we had already seen the scene we were watching.  I could have swarn we were watching the same preview for the show over and over again, but when I would think back, other stuff had happened, and all seemed right.  I seriously thought my friends were playing a joke on me because I was tripping, and they were trying to 'trip me out.' I got pretty irritated, but they insisted they weren't playing any joke on me.  I calmed down becuase, well I was tripping, and maybe it was all in my head haha. I had multiple (6+) deja vu's during the trip.<br>
<br>
As far as side effects, the twitching/shaking/tremors were quite uncomfortable. Also, I couldn't stay at a constant temperature. One minute I'd be hot; the next minute I'd be cold. I was wearing a jacket inside, and I was sweating a bit.  I came away from the experience rather stinky.<br>
<br>
The entire experience lasted about 6 hours. ...An hour to come fully up and 3 hours (maybe a tad less) at peak.<br>
<br>
It was quite enjoyable (probably even more in nature in the summer), I'll certainly be doing it again. However, I may try 25 mg next time.<!--   End Body   -->

I am quite young, and live in one of the more expensive areas of the suburbs. This was my first true drug expieriance, all that I had had up until that point in my life was some DXM and alcohol. I can also quite honestly say it was the greatest experience in my life so far.<br>
 <br>
I had recently been suspended from school and was staying at my aunt's house. I had heard about the fantastic affects of certain sleeping pills. I purchased a box of them and downed all 32. One of the pills broke when I was attempting to remove it from the box, and when I ate it, it tasted strong and numbed my mouth. I didn't think that the experience would be much more than that of alcohol, so I didn't take much precaution in securing myself or making sure no one was home. For the first half hour nothing happened except a tired feeling, and I was dissapointed, so I just napped on the sofa.<br>
<br>
I don't know how long I slept. When I woke up, I was upset because I thought I had slept the high off, but then I moved my legs, and they were convulsing and shaking. It felt amazing! I felt like I was possessed with this feeling, that it just flowed through me. I couldn't stop it or control it, it just was. I loved not having to think about something, that I was just free. My breathing was slow, shaky. I felt it run through me, and I was so relaxed. <br>
<br>
I stood up and welcomed euphoria. I don't really remember walking, I just remember standing in the middle of the kitchen, and then feeling really heavy. But this was different then anything I had ever felt before. I felt like I was sinking, and it was special. It felt really good too. I rejoiced and walked around the living room. I circled around a coffee table, and remember breaking and kicking things across the room. I remember my subconscious telling me to stop, but then just asking myself, 'Why Stop?' I had not a care in the world. I stumbled around in utter bliss. I also have a faint memory where I beleive I called my real father and gave him a piece of my mind. But I'm still not sure if it happened or not, and have no way of verifying it because we haven't spoken since. <br>
<br>
My aunt came downstairs and asked me if I wanted a glass of orange juice. And that's basically all I remember. The truth about this drug is that it is excellant, amazing, incredable, but its very hard to remember anything after I take it. I remember certain moments like photographs, like flashes. I don't remember waking up in the hospital. It's like I just appeared there. The first thing I do remember is blood being taken from me. Five viles I believe. No pain, and I am usually quite squimish about those things. They moved me to another hospital, and I was moving slow, shaking, in complete ecstasy. I believe I was in a straight jacket, but I'm just not sure.<br>
<br>
In the ambulance, a very nice, young, handsome doctor began to speak to me. I was in about a half and half state. Not really there, not too far to speak. He asked me numerous questions, which ranged from if I had attempted suicide to my favorite subject in school. He was friendly and I just focused on his face the entire time. I was friendly too. I wasn't scared, and I'm usually tense and antisocial in any public situation. He asked me if my friends or me had ever done drugs, and I denied, saying they never would do that, which is true. For once I felt laid back and happy. I had this terribly dry mouth. My lips were cracked and I felt like the skin in my mouth was sort of peeling. On the long hall into the hospital, I had a clear vision of my best friend. I was thrilled she had come to see me and wish me well! She stayed with me and reassured me through the hallway and commotion, and I felt so eased. I asked for her later, and called my aunt by her name, but she never was there to begin with.<br>
<br>
I was placed in a comfortable hospital bed. And took yet another nap. I woke up and was convinced I was in my own bedroom, and demanded that everyone get the out. My adoptive mother told me she wasn't mad with me, eyes full of tears, and I cursed and screamed at everyone until she fled. At this time my room morphed into the hospital room, almost like a wave into focus. It was beautiful. But I was horrified when I realized where I was, and demanded to go home. I screamed and cried and shouted until some evil old fat bitch of a nurse came in and screamed at me. She threatened to strap me down to the bed and I just shouted back that they couldn't give me unwanted medical treatment. I was so destroyed when I realized my aunt wouldn't let me go home, even though I begged and pleaded. I stayed there through the night, crying and saddened. I knew there was nothing wrong with me. I sat there through various idiots touching my breasts, putting their stupid monitors on my chest to hear my heartbeat. I wasn't fully there, so it wasn't that bad, but still I can only imagine what they did to me that I can't remember, because I'm still missing my underwear that I wore that day. <br>
<br>
I pissed about 2 fuckn gallons over the course of that night. The bastards wouldn't even let me fully close the door to piss. Another thing I remember was looking at the mirror in the corner of my hospital room, and seeing my eyes, huge, black pits. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. It reminded me so much of the nirvana song, 'drain you', and now I knew exactly what Cobain meant.<br>
              <br>
I'm still not sure exactly how long I stayed at the hospital. I was in a very hazy state through this whole thing, and I don't really talk to my guardians. I do know it was at least over night. I know that there was no reason for any ambulance or help to be called. My aunt was just probably confused and didn't know what was going on. I just sat there with a water IV in my hand pumping me full of liquid to 'get the medication out faster.' The whole thing about the hospital was complete bullshit, especially since my 'mom' was a hippie at one time. I have no brain damage. The only lasting effects I have now from this are positive and beautiful. I have these terrificly creative and very life like dreams when I sleep now, and it used to be rare that I ever had any dreams at all. I loved it, I loved everything about it.<!--   End Body   -->

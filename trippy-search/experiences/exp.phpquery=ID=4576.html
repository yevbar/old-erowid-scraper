The following is all fiction and only could have occured in a sidereal universe:<BR>
<BR>
I decided to ring in the millenium celebrations with a bang, and<BR>
conveniently enough, I happened to have a tab of E and some recently ordered 2C-T-2.<BR>
<BR>
After reading the reviews and theories, I decided to potentiate the effects of the phenylthyamines by preloading on massive amounts of 5-HTP.  I have not read any credible research about the mechanism of 2C-T-2 interaction in the brain, but my theory goes:  If its anything remotely like mdma, extra seratonin floating in the bloodstream would help.<BR>
<BR>
I started out in the afternoon around 2pm by eating about 50mg of 5-HTP every 30 minutes.  In preparation for the piracetam I was also going to take later that evening, I took an over-the-counter neuronutrient mix (brand name: 4-thought) containing a healthy dose of Choline (to potentiate the piracetam), L-Tyrosine, Gingko Biloba, etc. [the standard stuff that comes in such mixes]- about 1 every 2 hours.<BR>
<BR>
As a side note, I noticed as the initial effects of the 5-htp kicked in, I felt better than I had in some months- I beleive a good dose of the stuff will really help people who feel a little permanently tweaked after an mdma experience.<BR>
<BR>
At 7pm, I ingested 800 mg of piracetam.<BR>
<BR>
Around 8:30pm, I arrived at a friend's house near downtown in preparation to go out and see the fireworks, timing it hopefully while I peak.  At this time, I orally dosed the E and 35 mg of 2C-T-2. I figured I was in for a good time, but I had no idea how hard it would hit.<BR>
<BR>
I did not have any expectations for this trip other than to have a good time, and to celebrate the New Year with hopefully an experience I would not forget.  <BR>
<BR>
At around 9pm, my stomach started feeling a little woozy, so I decided to go out and smoke a cigarrete.  By the time I was half way done, I was already starting to trip- I can only describe it as a 'phen buzz' that is the common mental buzz between both mdma and 2C-T-2.  Normally, I have an iron stomach, even under drugged conditions, but I was barely restraining myself from puking and had to go inside (as long as I didnt think about how much discomfort I was in, I was fine).  <BR>
<BR>
By 9:30pm, a wave of bliss hit me and I was full on tripping- hard.  Normally, it about 70 minutes for mdma to even start hitting me, but at this point, it was as if I was peaking on a normal mdma trip.  At this time, the piracetam had begun having its effects, and my brain went into full on search overload.  I did not have any third eye chakra opening (or if I did, I was too engaged to utilize it), but I did begin to think about my emotional state in a *much* more grandiose sense than I normally do.  It was as if my brain was now an overclocked computer, and the bandwidth between my emotion centers and logical centers had suddenly quadrupled in size.<BR>
<BR>
By 10:15pm I achieved a level of bliss I had never quite experienced in my life- My energy was flowing, and visions of Buddha promulgated my reality- my ecstacy originated from above my crown and flowed down into my body.  <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, I was sweating quite a bit, and my heart seemed like it was working overtime (though I don't actually know if it was).  I decided just to take things easy and not be physically overwhelemed by the euphoria I was feeling.  I was aware of my bio-emotional blockages and wanted to breathe through them, so I attemped some rythmic breathing to relax my body.  As I relaxed, I was overwhelmed by erotic energy, and I considered masturbating myself, but didnt as it this point, it felt as if my physical body was working overtime just to sustain the feelings I was having at the moment...  And from that time period on, I didnt really move much from the couch.  I consider myself to be a fairly experienced triptonaught, and I normally have no trouble interacting on a casual level (walking about the City, etc.) under drug influence- this time, it was just too much.  I started to feel very cool- cool in the same way that people on heroin describe- a complete lack of pain... My logical brain kicked in and informed me that this may be my bodies way of telling me to relax and much as possible and drink lots of water, lest I wind up some place I dont want to wind up (like a hospital).<BR>
<BR>
I became *very* empathic, and I could feel the zeitgeist of the City and planetary populace around me, and all I wanted to do was pour out all my love onto the universe.  At some point, my 2 friends (who happen to be lovers) went into some form of an arguement, and wound up with one of my friends walking out of the house, insisting that I go with him, with my other friend crying.  IN my psychedelic daze I began to walk out of the house, when a tugging in my heart let me know that I *couldnt* love my other friend crying, no matter how incapacitated I was to make rational decisions.  I walked back into the house, and let my other friend know that I was going to be there for them no matter what happpened.  With this process, I did something that I have had issues with my entire life- I followed my heart even under the influence of peer pressure and authority, and did what I considered to be the right and loving thing.  When I did this, my two friends reconciled (at least for that time), their differences.  My mind, still enhanced by piracetam, started making connections between philosophies of love all over the planet- whether it was buddha or christ.  It evolved into a much too up and close view of the Wheel of Karma, and how it could be broken by even the most simple actions of love.  Of course, I was massively dehyrdated, and realized that I needed to come down before I could practically start applying love.<BR>
<BR>
I sat back down on the couch and awaited my eventual come-down...  At midnight, the new millenium came in, and the City (San Francisco) exploded in fireworks.  I glanced out the window, somewhat regretting I couldn't walk the streets, and somewhat happy that I wasnt, given the chaos that was breaking out in San Francisco- trash cans were on fire, fireworks were going off on every block, and the sky was illuminated with myriad of colors.  It was as if the entire world broke out in a party.  Of course, every party in an American city has a downside, and I could hear the druken holler of people being harrassed, assaulted...  Gunfire and sirens.  Truly, 2001 had come in the world was in full rock and roll swing and I was loving every chaotic minute of precious *life* and evolution that comes in our more and more bizarre world. <BR>
<BR>
At this point, my brain has been through as assload of experience and information.  If I listen closely, I can almost hear the Piracetam surging through my nervous system and creating new dendrites and pathways in nootropic ecstacy.  By 2am, I transcended bliss and ecstacy and emotions, and I was  to tired to think of the all the ramifications- I attempted to fall asleep, or at least relax as much as possible, knowing full well that I couldnt.  My brain then shifted into a very bizarre state of being that was free of my concious judement, and I started to have very strange n-dimensional visions- I beleive I acheived a sleep state while tripping- a first for me!  It was as if I could see the functioning of brain as I slept.  Of course, I was very much concious on another level, so who knows what was actually happening.<BR>
<BR>
I finally started coming down around 7am, and attempted 'normal' sleep for the next couple of hours with not much success.  Finally, I went out and got lunch with a couple of other friends in an 'e-tarded' state- just exhausted on a spiritual level.  This is not like LSD or mdma, where all your systems are worn out- Although my body and brain were just fine, I felt as if I had experienced so so much as a human being an enormous amount in that one night (one of my friend's who had also done mdma in a different party of the city said he could tell just by looking in my eyes). I continued taking 5-htp and choline the rest of day, but I didnt wind up feeling more effective until after I had slept normally for a couple of hours.<BR>
<BR>
To sum it up, here's kind of what seemed to happen to me from a psychopharm-analytic perspective:  The 5-htp and mdma released a flood of empathic energy in me, while the 2C-T-2 seperated my logical mind from my emotions.  The piracetam and choline worked my mind into a computational frenzy especially when combined with the stimulant effects of the two phen drugs.  This trip was was of my most intense, probably second only to my first LSD trip.  Anyone who is planning on doing something like this should be forwarned for a nearly overwhelming ride all throughout.  It should be noted that the 5-htp worked really well, almost too well in extending the trip.  A typical phen trip for me last at the very most for 5 or 6 hours, with 2 or 3 hours of full intensity- this trip lasted around 9 hours at full intensity.<BR>
<BR>
I also beleive that the piracetam built new connections- hardwired parts of the trip: that has allowed me to bring back this experience in day to day living- I am still resolving (in a good way) the energy and emotions I experienced.  Of course, IMHO only Good Things like yoga and meditation can Truly help you in your life (and drugs can be sidestepped entirely), however I would recommend piracatem and MDMA in conjuction as a very powerful tool of personal development. That combined with 5-htp and 2ct2, I would reccomend for trying in a *very* safe and pleasant environment with *lots* and *lots* of water even if you are an experienced triptonaught.  <BR>
<BR>
I would be very interested in hearing other trip reports in conjunction with piracetam.<!--   End Body   -->

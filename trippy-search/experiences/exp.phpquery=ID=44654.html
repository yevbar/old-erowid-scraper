I had just had a gratifying encounter with a very cute blond a grade below me that day around the afternoon.  Dinner and study hours went by fast.  I was in Tod's room and he told me to come to his room around midnight.  I wasn't very excited.  I thought I had done my share of DXM a few times.  So three hours later, I tiptoe upstairs to his room and some Grateful Dead (Europe 72) was playin softly in the background.  It was around February.  Valentine's day, my birthday, was coming up soon. I was in a bit of a ditzy, romantic mood.  Todd was feeling reminiscent.  It rubbed off on me that night.  I waited in his room while he prepared two bags worth of mashed up sucrets stirred into warm water.  He said most of the DXM had crystalized to the bottom.  I downed the liquid anyway.<br>
<br>
The warm beverage sweetly seduced my insides.  I kept thinking about that blond girl and then began going on about love in general.  I told him about my first love from age twelve; 'Laniea'.  She was a gorgeous red head.  Feelings were mutual for a while.  Just thirty minute later, with all this warmth and love in me and the room, a former student had just sold a dime to Todd.  The previous year that guy was one of my favorite people on campus.  I started thinking about him as we hit from the chronic.  <br>
<br>
The bud was great.  It was my first time I've ever done weed and DXM together.  It felt great.  The effects the day after continued to sooth my soul.  I said something to that cute blond and opened my heart to her.  It felt very uplifting and in a way relieving.  I felt like I had been tickled with a feather all night the previous night I did all that stuff.<!--   End Body   -->

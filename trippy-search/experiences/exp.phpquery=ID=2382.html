11:45PM<br>
-------<br>
        I weigh out 50mg of Ketamine HCl which was obtained pure (not as<br>
an injectible solution) from a chemical supplier. It is a crystalline<br>
powder with some rather large chunks that look like crystals of table <br>
salt. I crush this to a fine powder, then further powder it with a razor<br>
blade, and divide it into two even lines. This is about my 8th experience<br>
with ketamine, though I've never written a report about it before. Looking<br>
at this 50mg, it appears to be alot more than what I've done before.<br>
Erowid's ketamine dosage page states 'One method for nasal use is to<br>
insufflate (snort) 25 mg in each nostril, wait 5 minutes and repeat until<br>
you reach your desired dosage.' I do not anticipate that there will be any<br>
need to repeat. Looking at this, I visually estimate that most of my prior<br>
experiences have been with around 30-40mg.<br>
<br>
12:00AM<br>
-------<br>
        I insufflate the first 25mg. There is a mild burn, but not too<br>
bad. The file mentions doing 50mg at once. I've decided to space it<br>
out somewhat and see how things work out.<br>
<br>
12:03AM<br>
-------<br>
        I feel very noticable effects. My body begins to feel strange. My<br>
head has a sort of 'balloon-like' feel to it, its somewhat like nitrous<br>
oxide without the sound in the head. Speaking of sounds... I put on<br>
Orbital's live mix of 'Halcyon On & On'. Normally this song is very<br>
pretty... but now, even with headphones, it sounds muffled or distant.<br>
Ketamine certainly doesn't seem to enhance music - quite the opposite.<br>
<br>
12:11AM<br>
-------<br>
        I am getting strange visual disturbances. Hard to explain really.<br>
I have the impression that things are moving, but nothing looks as though<br>
its moving. Corner-of-the-eye type stuff... but much more so. There is<br>
a flittiness to the visual effects that is vaguely reminiscent (I was<br>
completely unable to spell this word myself and had to ask for help on the<br>
Internet) of the visual effects produced by ecstasy. My visual field is<br>
swimming... thats the best word for it, somehow. As if looking at<br>
everything through some kind of moving liquid.<br>
<br>
12:18AM<br>
-------<br>
        There is a noticable drop in intensity of the effects. Visual<br>
effects are still present. I still have a feeling of 'dumbness' (not being<br>
able to remember words, etc). In fact I am nowhere near baseline. But the<br>
initial rush is over. My body feels 'weird.' There are no closed eye<br>
visuals.<br>
<br>
12:30AM<br>
-------<br>
        I still feel a little unusual, and my visual field is still<br>
swimming a little, but the effects are more or less over. 25mg remains<br>
sitting on my plate. I'm not sure I want to do it... I feel as if I wasted<br>
the first 25mg by sitting in front of a computer and trying to describe it<br>
in realtime - as if the very act of attempting to describe the effects<br>
prevents the more interesting effects form appearing.<br>
<br>
12:40AM<br>
-------<br>
        I divided the remaining 25mg into 2 more lines, and put some Orb<br>
on through headphones. I insufflate one of the 2 lines, then go to lay<br>
down and close my eyes and listen to music.<br>
<br>
12:45AM<br>
-------<br>
        No significant increase in effects from that  mg, so I insufflate<br>
the other. I go back to laying down, after skipping to a different Orb<br>
tune (Little Fluffy Clouds, Dance Mix MK2).<br>
<br>
12:56AM<br>
-------<br>
        The song ends. I get up to start writing. My body feels somewhat<br>
'detatched' - I can't quite explain it. Its not numbness per se, but<br>
shares some qualities. Laying on my bed was very odd. The bed felt hard,<br>
and the pillows felt hard, as if laying my head back on a cloth-covered<br>
rock. The overhead light in my bedroom appears somewhat like the light<br>
over an operating table. Not much in the way of closed eye visuals. Open<br>
eyed, my room looks somewhat stark and my perspective seems odd. Is my<br>
heart beating OK, am I breathing normal? I think. Don't really care. I<br>
find myself thinking of mundane, every day issues, trying to find answers<br>
to things which have been on my mind - no answers come to me that haven't<br>
already come to me sober. I seem to be able to think about things in a<br>
detatched, analytical way, but there is no enlightenment coming that I can<br>
see. Most drug 'spirits' I've dealt with have seemed to be male or female<br>
- not so ketamine. The ketamine 'spirit' seems robotic or mechanical in<br>
nature. This molecule taps into some very different energies than the<br>
traditional psychedelics. I would not consider this a psychedelic at all.<br>
Its something else entirely.<br>
<br>
1:08AM<br>
------<br>
        I feel I'm in approximately the same place as I was at the 12:18AM<br>
entry above. Visual field is swimming. Feel physically weird...a slight<br>
sensation of motion, perhaps. Somewhat dulled sensation. Music sounds<br>
mostly normal. But the mental effects have noticably dropped off. I feel<br>
more 'coherent' and though quite a ways above baseline, I'm definately<br>
aware that I'm headed there.<br>
<br>
1:20AM<br>
------<br>
        Visual effects are still quite noticable, though dramatically<br>
less than what they were. Other effects are decreasing rapidly. I decide<br>
to smoke some cannabis and conclude this experiment.<br>
<br>
1:34AM<br>
------<br>
        I am on IRC... I just had a very intense deja vu experience. I<br>
recieved 2 variations on the same chain email from 2 friends who are<br>
totall unconnected (except through me). Then all of the sudden I realized<br>
that the conversation I was having on IRC was something I had before. I<br>
had the strange feeling that I existed in that time segment twice. Just<br>
thought it was worth mentioning... Strange!<!--   End Body   -->

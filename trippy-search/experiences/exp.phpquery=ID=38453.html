Im not really sure how to start this, but I will give it my best shot...<BR>
<BR>
I graduated high school in may of this year, and I decided to 'go all out' this past summer, seeing as it was my last summer before college, and had some wonderful memories. I feel I am reasonably well educated, however my intelligence comes with great labor. I am now in a local college from which im going to transfer to a college in California, and I plan to get a masters, and maybe even a phd in Pharmacology. I have been heavily interested in psychedelics since the first puff of marijuana I tasted at 13. I had always felt like there was something else, deeper in the mind that could only be activated at a certain time of life, or under a certain chemical. Up until that moment, I thought all drugs did the same thing (and by drugs I mean 'dope' which basically all drugs fell under). They got you drunk; thats all I needed to know. You can immagine my surprise when marijuana gave me its first effects!!<BR>
<BR>
But, as I'm sure many of you would like to bypass the chronicals of my life and my experience with mind altering substances, I will end that section with this: For the next two years, I read everything I could, educating myself about a facet of knowledge once unknown. I have read about basically every substance, its dosage and its effects etc., not so much so I could be a 'pro', but because all of this information was amazing to me. I began reading Shulgin's works and was just as amazed. I have thought to myself everything I possibly could about these substances. From 2c-e to DOM; GHB to AMT; though for most of them, I am yet to experience. (It's more of a trip to find out about all these substances that one may never have known about, than to take the substance itself!) Time is on my side I suppose, but in the meantime I have dabbled with DXM, cannabis, a few prescription drugs (never got to into that luckily), as well as LSA, salvia, and nitrous.<BR>
<BR>
SO ANYWAY, I have enjoyed going to a local mall for quite sometime on fridays. It's always nice to see friends, as well as after a while, I can find many of the (mainstream) drugs that I please. Summer was rolling around, the days were getting longer and the crowds at the mall were getting larger. However, after a while, the marijuana feeling that I held so dearly, became a common occurence on fridays, and nearly every friday I was starting to smoke, and buy for later in the week. It was becoming so common and bland, I lost sight of my reasons for smoking in the first place, but none the less it continued until august. So I got to the mall, looking for the normal group of friends I'm with, and maybe a little bud. A friend of a friend asked if I wanted to buy a 20 bag for 15, saying that he wanted to buy e so he needed to sell it. I was more than happy to buy it, and I decided to ask him to help me get some Ecstasy as well. I had never taken it before that day, and was a bit enthusiastic about it. So I bought the bag, met his friend J who had some pills, both D (the kid who sold me the bag, and has since become a friend of mine) and myself bought a pill each.<BR>
<BR>
About 15 mins later I swallowed the pill with a bit of water, and took a last look around me. 'My god', I said to myself 'There are alot of people outside the mall tonight!'.  <BR>
<BR>
T: 0.0 Swallowed the pill<BR>
<BR>
After swallowing the pill, which was a redish/orange superman pill (which had a very bitter taste), I walked around a bit, talked to some people, and met a kid and his two buddies who were looking for grass. I said 'what the hell', and we walked across the street into a grass sump, rolled a joint and smoked it. I think at this point I got my first alert without even realizing it, because the bag of bud was uncloseable, I told a kid smoking with me to hold it. Maybe it was malicious, maybe he forgot but in any case, I forgot to ask for the bag back and he walked off with it.<BR>
<BR>
T: +0.45 Smoked a joint<BR>
<BR>
As I arrived back to the mall, something was different. I had a mild weed-buzz but it seemed so 'right'. Within 5 minutes, an incredible sensation of rushing hit me like a freight train, and after a few moments of anxiousness this magical pill began its effects!<BR>
<BR>
T: +0.50 AND SO IT BEGINS<BR>
<BR>
Over the next two hours, I felt at home with everyone I talked to, and told a very serious entire life story to two complete random strangers (who might I add, were very friendly and listened). I trusted those around me, and after venting an entire life-time story, to a new found friend, some critical issues that had been plaguing me for sometime, were resolved in my mind. It wasn't a feeling of 'I don't care about my problems' like you might get from opiates or grass, but it was more of 'my problems are manageable, and I will be able to work through them.' It was the most amazing optomistic outlook I had ever had. The normal guards that stop you from saying things to people you know, were completely blown away. I bonded heavily with friends I have known for a while, and made new ones along the way. Words fail to express how connected I felt with those around me; how wonderful it felt to be alive; how majestic the green grass was, and how awe-inspiring the green trees were. (though maybe I just expressed it right there, heh..)<BR>
<BR>
T: +2.0 Rolling very nicely!<BR>
<BR>
After a few more hours, I went home, and I began to think about the things that have troubled me for many years. I was able to let go of a very painful relationship I had been involved in, as well as let go of my woes and fears of moving on to college. Those fears were replaced with something very alien to me: an optimism for the future. I looked forward to my first day in college, and I couldn't wait until my first kiss of actual love; but the funny thing was the waiting feel was fine, it almost made it better (think of marinating a steak over night, the longer it sits the better it is). I can say, without any conviction, that that pill of ecstasy along with a some wonderful music by The Orb (little fluffy clouds anyone?) left me with a wonderful outlook that I still maintain.<BR>
<BR>
I wasn't able to sleep much at all that night, and actually wound up waking up at 4 am to watch the olympics in my living room. Never had I been so impressed with the athletic abilities of my fellow man. Like a little kid on a saturday morning, I woke my mom up at 7 AM (T +13 hrs after dropping) and treated her to breakfast. My appetite wasn't much there but, what I did eat tasted especially good! Remember the optimistic outlook I told you about? It remained all the next morning, and though not as forcefully strong, is still there today, 4 months after taking that amazing tablet. I won't delve too much into my personal life, but after that night, alot of things changed in my life. I worked (and still am) on developing a better relationship between my mom and me, I put my cannabis habit aside indefinitely, began working out more, and COMPLETELY CHANGED the lazy habits I had picked up from pot. (if I haven't already mentioned, though I've used other substances, and enjoyed them immensely, cannabis was the only thing I used overly frequently). I now make time to clean my room, I watch a bit less TV, I do chores around my house without being asked: Those kind of things may seem very small from an outside view, but to me and my family they made a world of difference.<BR>
<BR>
I still enjoy going to the mall to socialize with friends, though, as I said, I've cooled the guns on my drug use. I have however, recently found an LSD source, and I may consider taking it in the winter. Tripping under the snow fall has been a fantasy of mine! <BR>
<BR>
<I>'What were the skies like when you were young?'<BR>
'They ran on forever...The skies always had little fluffy clouds the were long, and clear...'</I><BR>

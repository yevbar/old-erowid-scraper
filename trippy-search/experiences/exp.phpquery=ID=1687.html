Ok, I learned this the hard way! In the past I did 25 mg. of 2C-T-7 orally with some friends (I measured out the dosage by eye, so it wasn't entirely accurate). This dose took about 2.5 hours to come on and resulted in a very pleasant psychedelic afternoon. While the visuals were nice, I felt that I could have easily done 30 mg. I had no problem functioning mentally during this trip, as my mind was not blown apart like with acid,. <BR>
<BR>
Most of the trip reports on Erowid deal with oral dosages of this substance. Only one person reported snorting it. This person said that he snorted 15 mg. and had 'an insanely visual trip.' He said that the burn wasn't bad. The trip came on very quickly but was a little overwhelming. Well, I decided to try this route, as it seemed to have definite advantages: a more intense trip from less material (and therefore less money) with a faster launch period. I thought that 15 mg would be a good amount as I believed that I could handle 30 mg. orally (I was following the oral-4 insufflated-2 smoked-1 ratio). <BR>
<BR>
So alone in my bedroom at 1:30 am, I prepared to snort 2C-T-7. I had previously eyed out a 25 mg. dose, so I took this and divided it into five piles. I then snorted three of the piles. The burn was THE most intense pain I have ever experienced from snorting powders and I have snorted some painful stuff, including 5-MeO-DMT, DPT, and Crank. This stuff thoroughly burnt my nose and my throat. Then the taste from the drip was absolutely awful! Again, it was worse than any other powders. <BR>
<BR>
Within five minutes of snorting, it came on hard and fast. I was getting visuals even as I frantically dripped water in my nose. Fifteen minutes later the nasty taste and the terrible burn surged through my head again as I VIOLENTLY puked through both my mouth and my NOSE. <BR>
<BR>
Someone in the Shroomery said that high doses of 2C-T-7 resulted in a sensory overload; he/she was ABSOLUTELY right! I was alternately hot and cold. I expected the mad visuals but I did not expect the strong vibrations, which rattled up through my legs. While the visuals were better than any other psychedelic, I could not enjoy them. Every time I started to concentrate on them my heart would started pounding really hard. In fact, my heart hurt all throughout the trip and was sore for 24 hours afterwards. I was seriously worried that I might have a heart attack and I believe that I would have one at higher doses.<BR>
<BR>
Another difference between this trip and my oral experience was the effects on my mind. My mind was totally dissolved and I experienced complex hallucinations. For example, I thought that I had jumped out my window, then I told myself 'Wait! That's a hallucination. I'm standing outside the house,' then I thought 'Wait! That's a hallucination. I'm looking out my window,' finally I realized that I was still in bed and I frantically congratulated myself for not REALLY jumping out my window. I experienced this strange hallucination within hallucination within halluncination effect quite a bit throughout the trip.<BR>
<BR>
Even so, there were moments when I was completely lucid and could think clearly (this probably saved me from compeltely freaking out). These moments didn't last long and my mind would soon dissolve again.<BR>
<BR>
Besides the vibrations, mind dissolution, and heart problems, the other suprising aspect was the auditory hallucinations. My hearing was ten times more sensitive then usual. Activity outside sounded like it was right in the room with me. I kept turning down my music because it was overwhelmingly loud. The next day I turned on my stereo and tried to listen to music at the volume that I had set during my trip. I could barely hear the music; I had it turned almost all the way down!!!! Music was also VERY distorted during my trip. Singers sounded very different and the tempo was a lot faster than normal. After trying different types of music it was finally too much and I turned off my stereo. Yet even the quiet room was noisy! I began to hear a ringing in my ears which morphed into different music and voices. <BR>
<BR>
Around 6 am I fell asleep. I woke up at 8:30 am and read the newspaper, still tripping, although less intensely. The combination of a front page story about Meth, complete with a grim crew-cut wearing cop holding bags of Methamphetamines, and a picture of John Travolta as an alien in Battlefield Earth, was too much; I went back to bed. My vision was still slightly affected around 4:30 pm, when I woke up again. <BR>
<BR>
In summary, 2C-T-7 insufflated is a COMPLETLY different experience than doing it orally. I will never snort 2C-T-7 again. The burn, nasty taste, and rough somatic effects were too painful. If my account of the wild visuals sounds fun, don't be fooled; it was really not worth it. I could easily see some kids mess around with this or get unwittingly dosed, and just like that 2C-T-7 would be the new³ PCP. Stick to the enjoyable oral doses but still be very careful. I want to try the 30 mg. oral dose but I imagine that high oral doses could be just as intimidating. <BR>
<BR>

Dose: 150-300 mg/ day<BR>
<BR>
I realized that I had a problem, for I had always questioned my sanity. Yet through it all, I secured my BA in English,and had been a valued employee of the Chemistry Department of a local hospital where I worked for nearly fifteen years. In the back of my mind however--the self-sanity quiz took place. To the question of what’s wrong with me, I finally have my answer: Not a thing. Not anymore.<BR>
<BR>
I had experienced 17 years worth of symptoms, including panic attacks, anger and depletion of energy. My liver was beginning to deteriorate, I had disturbed vision, facial rashes, stomach aches. I sought help. I was diagnosed with Muscular Dystrophy, rosacea, gastritis, and a host of other medical problems, not to mention mental insufficiency-- I was admitted into a psyche ward because my family was concerned.<BR>
<BR>
I was poisoned by caffeine; an ongoing dance with the devil, and I wasn't aware of it because I had built up a toxicity. I drank 2-4 cups of coffee a day, and maybe a candy bar at night. I never touched teas, or sodas.<BR>
<BR>
Through the years I suffered several miscarriages, and TMJD.Allergies and sinusitis had been diagnosed. Antibiotics and antihistamines had been swallowed. I drank coffee-- and Benadryl.<BR>
<BR>
Like other drugs, caffeine also has the ability to depersonalize. When I stopped drinking coffee I felt as though someone else stepped from the back of my mind and my old self stepped forward to eliminate the “alien” in my mind.  I had always prided myself on being reserved, polished, cultured and educated. That is who I am--it is not who I became while my mind raced out of control. Once quiet and compassionate, rashness and irrationality overcame me. Personal relationships had been jeopardized. <BR>
<BR>
To those who may suffer some of the above symptoms, please reassess your caffeine intake. Indeed, it is a psychoactive drug; one easily obtained. But it can destroy the body and mind. Gratefully I have a medical background because I actually confronted the physician with my suspected caffeine allergy. He agreed, and said 'Not only are you allergic, but you are toxic.' <BR>
<BR>
I had organic brain syndrome, caused by a substance introduced into my body that interfered with my natural mental capacities. And I wonder how many others are suffering needlessly with the knowledge that something is wrong with them. And I wonder how many people are needlessly consuming psychiatric drugs? Luckily, I am not.<BR>
<BR>
My rational has returned, and every medical problem has ceased. I have organized my home, and I have applied to graduate school. <BR>
<BR>
For me, caffeine is the devil's advocate and I will never touch it again. I am enjoying life once again...caffeine-free.<!--   End Body   -->

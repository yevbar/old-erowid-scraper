My eagerly anticipated package came at about 3:00, right as my mom came home. 'What's this?' she asked. 'Just a stupid toy...' I said. She probably thought it was a sex-toy or something.<BR>
<BR>
I went right to my room and got my equipment. A razor, tweezers, and a candle. I poured out four batches of eight seeds and went to work scrapping them. Once I got as much of the white crust off as possible, I held them each briefly over a flame, one by one. <BR>
<BR>
Later, at 5:00 PM three friends and I put our seeds in our mouths. I chewed mine up as much as I could, and kept chewing as the unpleasent, but not horrifying seeds started to naturally get absorbed into the rest of my mouth's fluids.<BR>
<BR>
I was amazed at how fast these seeds kicked in. It usually takes me an hour to feel acid kicking in, but after about 15 minutes I knew it was working. Another 30 minutes and I felt like I was stoned off pot, but much more alert. <BR>
<BR>
This feeling progressed rapidly for a couple hours. It was strange how subtly but quickly the trip went from a stoned feeling, to a TRIP feeling. Like I was high on pot, and before I knew it I was high on something else.<BR>
<BR>
Around the time this switch took place, we were all in an icecream shop to use the bathroom. At the beginning of the experience I felt a little bit nausious, but I didn't need to puke. I stupidly thought it'd be safe to eat a doughball (I was hungry since I fasted all day prior), and about 30 seconds after eating it my trip turned to hell.<BR>
<BR>
I felt totally miserable and sick and thought to myself, 'this is a really stupid, crappy drug.' The feeling got worse and worse, and I started to realize I needed to puke. I rushed to the bathroom and immediately hurled. I absolutely HATE vomiting, and it's much much worse under the influence of a psychedelic. I puked a little more a minute later, and all of a sudden I was thrusted into euphoria. I felt absolutely great. In two seconds I went from feeling totally miserable (I was actually contemplating calling my mom and telling her I had food poisoning), to feeling great.<BR>
<BR>
This whole trip wasn't really cutting it for me though. It wasn't the drug's fault, but I just wasn't satisfied with what we were doing. My girlfriend decided that we needed a weekend apart, and this was really getting to me. I missed her terribly, and knew that something was wrong. I was withdrawn from the group and my surroundings, really only interested in thinking about her and myself. <BR>
<BR>
I believe that any tripper should follow his instincts and do exactly what he thinks he should do (short of stepping in front of busses), so I excused myself from my friends and their pseudo-intellectual babble. <BR>
<BR>
It was about 9:00 PM I started walking, wondering what to do. I wasn't supposed to do it, but I HAD to see my girlfriend. Otherwise I would have gone home and been miserable. I called her cellphone, but it just rang for about three minutes. I started crying, desperate for a way to find her. I called her house, and her mom told me she was seeing a play at her school - but somehow I already knew this.<BR>
<BR>
Everything instantly clicked. I realized what our problem was. She was very much in love with me, and I was very much in love with her. The problem was I was never SURE of my love, I always thought there was something wrong with it. I doubted it somehow. I never really showed her I loved her. I told her, but that wasn't enough. She SHOWED me, but I never returned it. Of course she was trying to somehow become less dependent on me. She was in love with someone who didn't seem to reciprocate.<BR>
<BR>
I sprinted four blocks to the bus stop, and just made the bus. I found her school downtown, and they let me in for free to see the last of their play, 'West Side Story.' I sat in the back, not very interested in the amatuer effort. During the standing ovations I snuck out and waited near the exit where I could see everyone leaving, but they couldn't see me.<BR>
<BR>
After a few minutes of slowly progressing play-goers I saw her leaving with her friend. I didn't hesitate. I quickly walked up to her, and on the steps (we were surrounded by other people) I tapped her on the shoulder. She looked at me and was at first shocked, but she could see the emotion in my eyes and we so romantically and amazingly embraced. I couldn't help but crying. Her friend got us to my girlfriend's car. In the backseet I told her everything I figured out. I had conquered my own demons, and I had my chance to SHOW her I love her. That's exactly what I did. She was very happy I found her and did what I did. She missed me just as much.<BR>
<BR>
Now our relationship is super hunky-dorie... and I must say that without the HBWR, I probably wouldn't have had the guts, emotional clarity, and creativity to do what I did. <BR>
<BR>
Okay, sorry about all the sappy stuff, but it was what my trip was all about, so it's important. <BR>
<BR>
Here's some general stuff about the experience: The coming up is much more pleasant than LSD's onset, mainly because it's faster, smoother, and more certain. The peak wasn't nearly as intense. I was down by about 1:30, so it didn't last as long as acid either. I experienced no hallucinations, although I could force some visuals. This is no LSD. On LSD I could look at a landscape and see millions of mouths in the plants opening and closing for breathing. It's still an amazing drug, however, exspecially considering how easily obtainable it is. <BR>
<BR>
Although it's superficial in a sense, the visuals that come from acid are to me an important part of tripping. It just makes it mind-blowing, and in a way makes the mental trip more profound because I feel more removed from everyday reality, and better able to see it objectively. That's my only real disappointment with HBWR.<!--   End Body   -->

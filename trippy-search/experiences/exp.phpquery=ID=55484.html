INTRODUCTORY SUMMATION<br>
<br>
The following report details my personal experimentation with what was purported to be ergot derived LSA by itself and in combination with the seeds of Peganum harmala (Syrian Rue). <br>
<br>
SOURCE and ASSESMENT of the SUBSTANCE<br>
<br>
A trusted friend had given me what was supposed to be ergot-derived LSA on small (about ¼” x ¼”) plain white squares of paper. Of course I have no way of saying what this stuff actually was. He assured me that his source was reliable and that this substance was an extraction of LSA from ergot and not a synthesis of LSD or anything else. I would go into further detail along these lines of reasoning but I have already done this in my experience report entitles “Lysergic Bioassay I – Visual and Auditory Phenomena” which the reader can look over. <br>
<br>
<br>
The EXPERIENCE<br>
<br>
As mentioned I took 3 tabs. Whereas I could barely feel “psychedelic” on 1 tab about 1 month earlier, 3 tabs was definitely a good strong dose, but not too much. Soon after taking the tabs I gently stretched, did a little yoga and so on. As I waited for the effects to sink in I listened to music, looked at art books and so on. Once I began to really feel it I put on a CD called “The Tibetan Tantric Choir” which is the chanting of the Gyoto Monks (Buddhist) of Tibet, a recording made by Mickey Hart. I turned off the lights, sat cross-legged with my back straight and chanted along. By the very act of chanting along with this recording one does breathing exercises. It also seems to lower the brain waves if one relaxes into it. This usually seems to “tune me up” and it certainly did this time. <br>
<br>
After some time I went outside to commune with Nature. The summer night dew on the grass felt amazing on my bare feet. I felt connected to Mother Earth. I gazed up at the starry sky and was dazzled by the twinkling brilliance. Many stars were blinking, streaking, flashing and slightly wandering. The longer I stared the more interstellar I felt. Whether it was illusion, perceptual enhancement or a little of both, I could see depth in the stars I never could before. In other words, rather than points of light on a relatively flat surface (how the human eye normally sees the night sky) it seemed obvious that some stars were further out than others. After some time of this I reminded myself that I was connected to the earth and looked down, touched the grass, touched the leaves of plants, etc. Then I would gaze at the stars again. Nature is divine. The world and the cosmos are our mother and grandmother as the sun is our father. <br>
<br>
At some point before the peak effects I went back inside. I did my own version of what has been called “The Ritual of the Pentagram”, “The Banishing Ritual” etc. This is used in modern Wiccan and neo-pagan traditions. It has been used in different forms in various pagan traditions in Europe and certainly contains Gnostic and Hermetic elements.<br>
<br>
One establishes a circle about oneself, resonates pentagrams in the air with hand motions and long intonations, a pentagram at each of the four directions. In my own version I then do long, slow intoning chants for each chakra, each with it’s own note and syllable. I will spare the reader the full explanation, but suffice to say that this ritual serves to center ones attention, clarify intention, to lower the “volume” of the everyday world so that one can open up to so much more – the inner and outer world.<br>
<br>
I find this practice to be increasingly beneficial as I do it more and more. Without entheogens it works well. With entheogens it works very well. Once the circle is established and I open up to the influx of energy, I then meditate, do yoga, tai chi, or simply think about life and love and what not.   <br>
<br>
This time, having established this circle and having opened myself up, I did some yoga and tai chi. This was wonderful. I could feel myself opening up to more and more flow. Chi (as the Chinese call it) or prana (as yogins call it) was flowing through me. As I sometimes do, I began with formal moves from both traditions and then, once things were flowing, I moved spontaneously. The less I thought about what to do, the more I flowed. It was easier to maintain a meditative state of calmer thought (or no thought) and increased awareness.<br>
<br>
I could feel more and more energy move through me. Here is where it get a bit challenging to explain. I could feel so much energy moving into me that I felt that I could harness this as power in some way. Thankfully, however, I had no intentions of harnessing this for myself. I let it flow back out of me. Consequently I could feel more energy flowing into me. I let this flow out. More flowed in. More flowed out. This whole time I was moving in pseudo tai chi motions. Many of us have done or have seen the flowing, fluid dance motions at raves and what not. Well, I suppose I must have looked as if I were doing such a dance but in slow motion. So much energy flowed through me but only in the beginning did I have linguistic thoughts like, “Wow! This is amazing!” or “I can really feel the chi!”.<br>
<br>
For the most part I remained aware but did not have distinct thoughts with logistic meaning. The reader may have heard similar sayings, but it was as if I was like a flexible reed banding in the wind. If I had been rigid like a stiff tree I would have been broken in a sense. Or I was like a hollow tube, so much flowed through me that if I were plugged up at one end I would have been blown out in a bad way. Thankfully, I was able to let go and simply let it all flow.  <br>
  <br>
This went on for what must have been 1 to 3 hours or so, slowly increasing in intensity and then slowly decreasing in intensity. At some point I slowed to a stop and finally had a distinct thought again. “Wow!” I thought, “I have been doing this for a couple of hours! That was so amazing! I can’t believe how wonderful that was!” or similar thoughts. It was truly an amazing experience.<br>
<br>
The peak had passed. I made what I call Harmala tea from 1 ¼ teaspoons of coarsely ground seeds of Peganum harmala (Syrian Rue) and hot water from a kettle. This contains harmaline and harmine which are MAOIs.<br>
<br>
<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Combining MAOIs with other psychoactive drugs carries serious medical risks and can result in extremely unpleasant side effects, overheating, nausea, confusion, heart problems, and even death. Please see <a href="../chemicals/maois/maois.html">Erowid's MAOI Vault</a>]</FONT> <br>
<br>
I drank this tea and, as it had the first time I tried this combination (see my experience report “Lysergic Bioassay I – Visual and Auditory Phenomena”) I found it to be both grounding and more “psychedelic”. It was very enjoyable. I found myself writing love notes to my wonderful wife with little hearts, whimsical handwriting, images of faeries and tantric embraces, etc.  <br>
<br>
I then laid down for the night… OK, well it was actually morning by this time. Just as I had heard the first time I tried this LSA (or whatever it is) I was hearing a lot of tweaked digital droid bird-like techno sounds. Again these sort of swelled “up” slowly and then back “down” as I described in my “Lysergic Bioassay I” experience report. In the heart of the summer, there was a thick jungle of sounds from buzzing insects, clicking birds, and so on. I could swear that my breath and brain waves were in sink with the cycles of insect shrills surrounding the area that I could hear clearly through the open windows. <br>
<br>
Overall it was a great, powerful and experientially mystical experience. I have tried some more tabs one time since this experiment occurred. This experience was very intense and I have submitted this report under the title “Lysergic Bioassay III – Cosmic transducer”.<!--   End Body   -->

I was taking Effexor, just started it the day before I went to the peyote meeting.  I was not sure what to expect but I put my faith in the peyote medicine.  Asking to allow the effexor medicine to aid in balancing my brain chemistry so that I may feel well again.  I started out with just a couple of buttons, then an hour later I ate 4 more.  At this point I was feeling the medicine just like usual.  An hour passed and the medicine was working on me a bit stronger that usual, I was dreaming much deeper than usual.  However I was able to stay in complete control.  I did notice my eyes twitchin which is unusual.  <BR>
<BR>
The dreams and visions were unusual and very deep, I was seeing things that concerned the patient having the ceremony and then seeing my own issues that I need to clean up in my life.  I felt like I wanted to jump up and fling my arms up in the air but this did not happen it was just a hint of maybe what I was feeling in the ceremony.  the medicine worked on me for a couple of hours and finally calmed down and I was feeling normal near the morning.  I forgot that I had taken the effexor and continued through the ceremony like usual the rest of the time.  I left that day and went home, feeling like I usually do after meetings good for having sat up for someone elses health and well being.  <BR>
<BR>
I feel good that I could have helped in that sort of way.  My songs during the night came out in a very good way, which I'm sure made people feel happy.  That's all the matters is that everyone felt good.  I didn't feel hungry at all the next day.  I did pray with more medicine and tea the next day.    Noticing there is no bad results of combining the effexor and peyote.<!--   End Body   -->

I had recently learned how to extract DXM from Robatusin DM, and was enjoying it in moderet to high doses.  the extraction was simple useing Naptha, White Amonia, And lemon juice. i wont go into detail the process is easy to find on line. It took about 2 hrs to get a good clean product.  distasefull, but a little sprite does the trick.   i had made a large batch with two bottles of robotusin and only used half that day.  I left the other half sitting on a shelf in my room. the following day after work i decided what the hell its a lot but i was ready for it.<br>
<br>
6:15pm (t+0:00)  I grabed the plastic cup and threw it back.  what a horable alkaline taste.  chased it with water and sprite to finaly get rid of taste.  then i sat and turned on the TV.  <br>
<br>
(t+:15) I was telling my girl (B) that she should stick around becouse i had just dropped and its always good to have a sitter at high doses. then all of a sudden i was overcome by extream itching, sweating, and a really bad stomach cramp, the worst one I've ever had. I ran to the bathroom and instantly lost the contents of my stomach.  then i was perfectly fine and relaxed.  i started to feel like i was floating above the toilet.<br>
<br>
I couldn't beleave that i went from the worst stomach cramp of my life to a blissfull floating in one second.  then i was thrust into compleate confusion.  stoll blisfull and happy. i tryed to tell B what was happening but when i tried to form words only uninteligable sound came out.  i couldnt speak a single word of english for ten min. And the visuals started to kick in. verry intens colors and lines, with trails four foot long.  the radio was so clear and i could feel the emotions of the singer as if they were my own. <br>
<br>
(t+0:25)  it felt like an eternity when i asked B how long i was standing there trying to make sense of it all and se said i had just come out of the bathroom ten min ago, and had dropped less than a half hour ago. this information blew me away, i thought it had been atleast 2-3 hours. So she led me to a chair in front of the computer and helped me look up DXM again online.  thats when i found out that DXM decomposes fast into DXO and DXO is stronger than DXM. and since my liver wasnt doing it slowly i was feeling the full effect of just DXO. so i turned on some techno and strped in for the ride.  i was still having trouble forming words and thoughts, but it was lots of fun.<br>
my eyes were bugging out of my skull and i hardly bliked at all.<br>
<br>
(t+0:45) i lost touch with reallity all together, i didnt know where i was , who B was, Or who i was. one of the few times i have actualy not known who i was or what my name was.  then an intense stimulant effect set in, and i wonderd throgh the house trying to make sense of anything at all.  i knew B's face was friendly so i just kept walking by without fear but the rest of the house started to scare me. i was shaking all over and ringing my hands constantly. B said i looked scared the whole time, but i think i was mostly confused. And my eyes were vibrating non stop. i couldnt stop them, B confermed it was my eyes and not just a hallucination. So i sat down and tried to bring back a little reality, i dint work. the more i thought the more confused i got.<br>
<br>
now this is where it gets hazy, i dont remember much of the next hour and a half. B said i just walked around the house with a look of horror on my face but i remember i was not afraid any more and was actually really happy with my experiance.<br>
<br>
(t+2:30) i found myself coming off the intense peak and could form word and thought again. my eyes were still vibrating and my heart was slightly fast and my temp was a little elivated. but i felt fine, i could hear the music again and could sit still. then i started thinking about my homework that was due the next morning. it was a simple assingment but i was far from being able to comprehend it. and i started to worry about coming down in time to do it. then what if i dint do it and failed the assinment, then how it would affect my grade i slowly spun myself into a bad trip. i felt as if i had just ruined my life and was going to flunk college, becouse of this tiny little grade. i lost it and started to cry  go into a great dispare. a sat back in the chair and and cotinued downward into the depths of fear and dispare. then all of a sudden i couldnt hear B asking me what was wrong anymore. and everything around me dissapeared. i was left sitting in the chair in a black void. and all of a sudden i could see the back of my head, then the chair and finaly i had stepped compleatly out of my body and was looking down at myself sitting in the black chair in a black void. nothing else existed. then i(my body and chair) slowly turned  untill i could see the fronf of myself. when i looked into my own eyes i could feel nothing at all and then i slamed face first into myself and was back in my body still in the void.  i dont know how log i was actualy in the void but it felt like a half hour. then i could hear a voice, it was calling my name from all around me. It was B.  then i rememberd B and my life and college and then her voice got louder and louder untill it was booming.  then instantly i was back in front of the computer and Bwas crying and asking me what was wrong.  I broke into tears again and could still feel the saddnes but it was fadeing.  i tolder what was wrong and she helped talk me back to reallity and told my the homework was done, i had actualy done it some time during my trip and forgot or just didnt know i did it.  so i calmed down and could hear the music again and my eyes had stopped vibrateing. it was now 12:30am(t+6:30)<br>
<br>
that is the most i have lost touch with this reality without using Salvia, Shrooms, or LSD. the next 2 hours were a quiet calm come down with a little help from 'Mary Jane'. i dint fall asleep until about 4:00am. mostly becouse i couldnt stop asking B questions about my trip, and when she fell asleep i sat there pondering the experiance.  she said i looked like i was schizophrenic.  i felt that had lost my mind.  good thing it came back. in all it was a learning experiance and ive done it again at a much lower dose but thats another story.<br>
<br>
i guess the moral of the story is do your resurch before partakeing, and allways have a sitter. i dont know what i would have done if she wasnt there. i know i contemplated suicide.  So know your chemical and know your dose. of you might not come back.<br>
<br>
good luck to all you phyconouts out there!<!--   End Body   -->

Background Info: My cousin “TRIP” and I decided to trip on shrooms together for our 3rd time on a beautiful Friday night in December. We had gotten 7 grams of gorgeous blue and gold mushrooms during the previous week and we had been preparing all week for what would be our most amazing trip yet. My friend had died in a tragic car accident during our preparation week and I was scared of having a bad trip due to my constant bad moods. Believe it or not, this had very little or no effects on my trip. <br>
<br>
10:45 P.M. - TRIP’s little brother and mom were upstairs watching a movie and we couldn’t wait any longer so we both opened our bags and began eating the shrooms. We finished 2 grams in about 5 minutes and we decided to hold off on the rest for a little bit.<br>
<br>
11:05 P.M. - I began noticing similar patterns and vibrant colors similar to our previous trips. This is when we knew we were beginning our journey.<br>
<br>
11:15 P.M. - We turned on some music to get us in the right mood. (…some Pink Floyd, and Cursive) I soon began feeling a little uneasy so I decided to grab my headphones and chill with my eyes closed for a few minutes because I didn’t want that “bad trip” I was worried about to actually happen.<br>
<br>
11:20 P.M. - After listening to some songs to myself for a few minutes I began to feel fine again and we decided to take the rest of the shrooms so we could begin our dream. The only problem was that we had lost one of the bags! We began looking for it but we kept losing focus and forgetting what we were looking for. One minute we would be furiously looking and worrying and the next minute we would be laughing and talking about random things and how amazing our futures were going to be.<br>
<br>
11:30 P.M. - Finally we found the bag right under a blanket on the bed that we had been sitting on. TRIP was extremely relieved and suggested that we finish up our bags. TRIP’s mom came down at this point to put his younger brother to bed in the room just outside of ours. We went out to greet her carefully making sure we didn’t say or do anything completely idiotic. His mom asked where the “red blanket” was for his younger brother and we calmly got it for her after some minor arguments. (We desperately wanted that blanket for some reason, even though it served virtually no purpose to us, as we were only sitting on it at the time and not actually using it.)<br>
<br>
11:35 P.M. - TRIP’s mom went upstairs and I decided that it was necessary that I had to use the bathroom which was upstairs. I stumbled up the stairs with very little coordination and made it to the bathroom where I looked in the mirror and noticed that my face wasn’t quite right. I saw flashing colors in his bathroom which distracted me for awhile but I finally finished up and left. I walked past his mom who said “I’m very tired, I’m going to bed…” I replied with something along the lines of “Yeaaah, me too…” To my surprise my voice sounded quite distant from my body, as if I was watching myself in a movie or dream. <br>
<br>
 <br>
11:45 P.M. - I made it back downstairs to the basement where TRIP was pacing around the room looking confused. He was glad to see I made it back alright. I told him about the encounter I had with his mom and he questioned me for awhile, wondering if his mom noticed anything.<br>
<br>
11:50 P.M. - We we’re both noticing a field of colors in our vision and we became somewhat excited that the shrooms we’re beginning to fully kick in. We decided to get out our bags and finish them up.<br>
<br>
12:00 A.M. - Around this time we had devoured our entire bags and we’re laying on his bed when we decided to put our favorite movie in… “Alice in Wonderland”. In our previous trips we had always watched this movie. We had experienced a full-out fantasy “dream-like” state when we had watched this movie during our previous trip, and we had believed that we had almost found the true meaning of life and why we existed as human beings. We basically wanted to try watching this movie again to see if we could understand it better, and maybe continue the trip from where we left off last time.<br>
<br>
12:10 A.M. - We turned off the stereo and began watching “Alice” as we like to call it. We both sat on the bed taking a few pictures so we could remember our faces the next day. This is the point where we both began losing reality.<br>
<br>
12:15 A.M. - TRIP exclaimed to me that he felt as if the bed were a liquid and he was drifting in it. I had been feeling the exact same way and we discussed this oddity for a few minutes. Soon we began talking about our lives and our “previous lives” and what it means to be “living”. These conversations had plagued us in our past trips. We had convinced ourselves that we knew the answers to everything. <br>
<br>
12:25 A.M. - This is the point where we began to notice our connectedness in our trips. It felt as if we were sharing the same senses and feelings and we both noticed the same exact visuals. Suddenly out of the corner of my eye I noticed an extremely short person who had just entered the room. I tried to look directly at him but he had disappeared. I told TRIP about what I had seen and he replied quite simply “Yeah, don’t worry, that was only James… ” We both looked at each other and began laughing uncontrollably at this for about 5 minutes straight. Neither of us knew where that comment or name had come from, but it just seemed right for some reason.<br>
<br>
12:30 A.M. - I looked over and noticed a black cat on top of his laundry basket. I realized that he did not even own a cat to begin with, and with this thought, the cat disappeared almost instantly. <br>
<br>
 <br>
12:35 A.M. - At around this time, things got weird. We began “melting” into each other and we both stated how we felt like we were in a dream. It felt as if we were out of our bodies watching this whole scene from a distance. TRIP noticed that my arm which I was leaning on looked quite distorted and I just laughed and told him not to worry, my arm was fine. We began looking at the Alice in Wonderland poster which we had bought during the previous week and we noticed the creatures popping out of the poster. This was an amazing sight to look at. We were both mesmerized for quite some time. We looked at all the various posters in his room and noticed specific features and colors in all of them. The colors in the posters looked as if they were flowing like rivers. TRIP began telling me how everything he looked at looked furry. He said it looked as if the walls were growing hair. This seemed weird to me because I soon noticed the same effect.<br>
<br>
12:45 A.M. - We suddenly both noticed that the entire room looked extremely hazy and smoky. It was as if we were both living in a dream. We discussed all the possibilities of what we would be able to do in this dream. The thought that we were actually experiencing a fantasy dream seemed amazing to the both of us. TRIP got up and sat next to his standing mirror and stared at himself for what must have been 10 minutes. He did not say a word, he just stared. He told me that his arms seemed out of proportion with the rest of his body, and as I looked I noticed the same thing once again. This is when we realized we were having a “connected trip”. We both were experiencing the same visuals and effects. I realized that whenever he left my field of view, I felt uneasy and lost, and when he came back to me I felt comfortable again… like we were both at home again and happy. <br>
<br>
1:00 A.M. - Our trips began to peak at this time. I had suddenly “transported” to the bed opposite of the one we we’re laying on. I asked him how I got there and he replied “Got where?… you’re still on the same bed we started on.” He reassured me that I had not moved from my starting place, and I realized that it was all in my head. We talked about ridiculous things for quite some time. He was convinced that I was his brother, when in reality I am his cousin. I still felt like I was lying on the other bed. I could only see my right arm which I was leaning on. My other arm had disappeared and did not seem to exist. For some reason, this did not seem to frighten me in the least bit. I kept reassuring myself that it was only in my head and I was having an amazing trip.<br>
<br>
1:30 A.M. - I had “transported” once again to the bed which I had started on. We watched “Alice” and cried uncontrollably at its beauty. We didn’t really understand why we were crying, we just knew that it was beautiful and the whole movie was what life was “supposed to be like”. The smoking caterpillar in the movie befriended us. He seemed like an incredibly friendly character and it was as if he was trying to communicate with the both of us. TRIP named this caterpillar “Eastfall” (named changed). We looked to his poster where the same caterpillar was and we greeted “Eastfall” with enthusiasm.<br>
<br>
2:00 A.M. - Neither of us was the least bit tired. We continued tripping in our fantasy dream. We both felt amazing. It was an indescribable feeling. TRIP’s room had taken an orange haze now and everything looked so beautiful. Everything in his room seemed to have a life of its own. Everything was “breathing” and living with us in our dream. Everything that one of us felt was felt by the both of us. We shared the same feelings and thoughts. The mushrooms took us to a comforting fantasy world where we knew exactly what each other was thinking. Quite a weird, unexplainable effect that we believe can not be achieved by any other drug. The mushrooms served as a spiritual guide to the both of us, guiding us through thoughts of existence, the future, and beauty.  <br>
<br>
2:30 A.M. - I tried to sit upright in the bed but just didn’t feel as if it was possible. I did not want to move… I just wanted to observe the dream and figure out why we were in it. We talked and talked until about 3:15 A.M… <br>
<br>
 <br>
3:15 A.M. - We had the feeling of “waking up” from the dream which we had inhabited for the past 5 hours. It felt like we were waking up from a long sleep. P guided me down what seemed to be a familiar long corridor which didn’t really exist. He kept telling me “Come on, It’s time to go home now… we’re going home”. This is when I woke up in the opposite bed once again. He came over to my bed and we discussed our trip. We we’re coming down, but still noticing the orange haze and flying colors throughout his room.<br>
<br>
3:30 A.M. - We both wanted to go to bed but we just couldn’t. We felt as if we had something left to do. We had left something unfinished. We didn’t really understand this feeling but we finally decided to put in our beloved “Chrono Soundtrack” and fell asleep wondering what it was that we had left undone.<br>
<br>
12:00 P.M. - We both woke up at the same time feeling refreshed and tired at the same time. We discussed the previous night but for some reason it seemed difficult to remember any exact details.<br>
<br>
Throughout the day we recovered various parts of our trip from the previous night and talked about them. We still felt as though we had left something unfinished. We are now planning on obtaining 8 grams of the magical mushrooms to see if this slight increase will help us find what we were looking for. Could it be the meaning of life, or the truth about our existence? We know one thing for certain though… the answers lie somewhere within “Alice in Wonderland”. Somewhere deep in that movie lies the secrets of our pasts, present, and futures. <br>
<br>
Until next time…our shared dream will not be forgotten and the answer is determined to be found. The answer that we have always been searching for…<!--   End Body   -->

<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Warning: Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]</FONT> <br>
<br>
Hello, I'm a 19 year old male, this experience happened when I was 16 years old, I first got the ideas of inhaling substances from school from some goth kids saying they did in the cafeteria. Me and my friends weren't part of this group of people so I didn't talk to them, but I remember how much the idea of getting 'high' on these would be, I herd them talking about duster and I remember my mom having a can of century duster it was called, I figured this would do the job. Having herd about gas inhaling too I thought 'fuck it might as well go all out' that thought will haunt me for the rest of my life.<br>
<br>
It was the long weekend and I knew that one night I would have the house to myself like I usually did cause I was an only that was something that I liked. Anyways they finally left and I put my plan to work, I went to the garage and got my dads gas can, then I went and grabbed the duster from the cleaning cupboard. I went to my room naive with both the gas and duster and got ready for a good time. I turned on my tv and set the gas and duster on my tv tray. I sat on my bed and kind of started getting nervous, I passed it off though thinking that it wouldn't hurt me, besides, those other kids did it and seemed fine.<br>
<br>
I first started with the duster thought I'd take a few hits and then go for the gas and few of that and be done. So after taking a few deep breaths in preparation I shook the duster can and fired the first hit. A warm feeling came over me and I really liked it, then I got a little light headed too, it actually made me really hyper, and stupid. I started taking hit after hit almost full lungfuls. I think I did like 8+ hits within 20 seconds, I was feeling a little more buzzed and my lungs were hurting so stopped with the duster, I then switched to the gas practically laughing just at what I was doing feeling rebelish and superior.<br>
<br>
Soon after I switched to the gas I really felt the duster kicking in I started losing it, after 4ish hits of gas my lungs started burning pretty bad I was still to stupid to realise that this could be seriously bad for me. Shortly after though the pain started getting worse and I was almost totally out of it, still not really feeling major effects I think cause I did it all so fast and was trying to get that done. but then all of a sudden it hit me like a train, my mouth on the gas for like 3 seconds before I realised I was still on my hands and knees breathing it in, I knocked it away. spilling it all over my carpet.<br>
<br>
I got up with my lungs feeling a little better I didn't even think about cleaning the gas. I knew 1 thing though that I was high for the first time and very high at that. I at first thought it was pretty cool and I was seeing specks of color here and there, then all of the sudden I kept seeing shadows move and things seemed to jump at me. This is when I started to panic, as my high started getting closer to the top my worst nightmares started coming true, I saw an image of death come out of the shadows. I screamed at the top of my lungs thinking that this was the end getting higher I was barely able to walk as I ran away stumbling I fell to the ground hitting my arm on the glass table destroying it and seriously cutting my arm.<br>
<br>
By this point I was not on the planet any longer and as I got higher and higher the sickness also got worse, it didn't help that I was bleeding on everything without even the common sense to patch it up and go to the washroom. while I was lying there on the floor looking up I saw goblins and werewolves (sounds stupid I know) with my parents heads in there hands jumping at me and tearing my face off, my lungs got worse also by this point I could barely breath throwing up everywhere  I tried to roll away and scream but I couldn't.  I closed my eyes and just saw colors and fire which made me believe I was in hell, alternating between coughing puking and screaming I was honestly wishing for death.  All this happened within 5 minutes of my first duster puff<br>
<br>
Suddenly I don't know why but the puking stopped and was unable to scream, my lungs still felt like they had been ripped from my body but weren't bad as before.  I kept my eyes closed and all I could hear was evil laughter and steve urkels voice saying 'Did I do that?' over and over in different tones, that's when I lost all bodily function, I seized up stiff as a board and pissed and shit myself. the thoughts are a blur after that and I passed out. I woke up 2 hours later, I was still out of it not able to keep my mind on one thing and still seeing colors, but I remembered that I inhaled, I passed out again 4 hours later I woke up again still fucked out of my mind feeling like death I looked over and saw the disaster I made with the outer part of my forearm cut almost to the bone lying in blood with more still slowly seeping out, this made me extremely light headed and I guess I rolled more than I thought because there was blood all over my basement floor.<br>
<br>
I crawled to the bathroom where I managed to wrap a towel around my arm the act of going to the bathroom made my pain and sickness 100x worse. after collapsing to the bathroom floor and puking the last of my bile I passed out again, the next thing I heard was my mother screaming. My parents were home and my mom had found me in the bathroom at first they didn't know what happened my mom stayed in the bathroom while my dad called 911 and looked around. He went in my room and then pieced together what I did. The ambulance got there and I was taken to the hospital where I was monitored givin drugs and a i.v. The doctor told my parents I may have givin myself brain damage.<br>

<br>
After being in a chemically induced coma for 2 days I awoke and realized my strange surroundings, Only my mind was constantly wandering and I felt a major headache and couldn't think I could barely remember my name or my parents or friends. After 2 weeks I was let out of the hospital, with my parents aware of the damage I did to myself. All my mother could ask was 'Why?' My father has pretty well disowned me because I am not the same person I used to be, my brain is altered. It is 3 years later now I don't have friends because I can't socialize. I went from a normal healthy kid that was good in school with a high 80 average to a high school dropout who can't run 10 steps without having to stop for half a minute to catch my breath because I fuckt my brain and lungs up.<br>
<br>
To this day I still have a pounding headache, and can't even walk straight this story alone took me over 3 days off and on to wright and without spelling check you probably wouldn't read it I know I am screwed for life all because of one dumb mistake. I can only warn others that its not worth it, and I wish I knew the dangers before I went and tried something stupid like that. My parents never left me home alone again.<!--   End Body   -->

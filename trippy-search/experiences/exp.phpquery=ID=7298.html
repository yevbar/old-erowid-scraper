I'll admit this now.  I was in a pretty depressed state and I needed something that would either mellow me out or kill me.  At that point I didn't care.<BR>
<BR>
I had 16 tylenol 2 tablets just kicking around, so what the hell.  I tossed them back and swallowed them dry as fast as I could.  Didn't think much of it.  Codeine has never really done anything to me anyway.  And this experience is only barely an exception.<BR>
<BR>
My depression lifted and energy increased (caffeine boosts energy, which in turn will raise your mood).<BR>
<BR>
I ate dinner and watched a movie.  I then went upstairs to my room and read my book. At about midnight (T+ 05:00), I thought I should try to get some sleep.  I felt my depression like a shadow lurking behind my artificial contentment.  In the same way a person with an ailment can feel the shadow of pain behind their euphoria.  I had difficulty sleeping because i was still wired with caffeine.  I then drifted into a semiconcious state and entered the universe of paranormal.  I've been there many times before under the influence of many other drugs, but I felt nearsighted, the drug was strong enough to alter my perception, but was piss poor at doing so.<BR>
<BR>
After a while I got annoyed and found my self tossing and turning in my bed, just waiting to fall asleep(T+ 07:30).  Then my 'high' took a turn for the worse.  For about 15 minutes, I rationalized countles horriffic things that could happen to me right there and then: heart failure, brain bubble, etc, but then I convinced myself that there was a figure next to my bed ready to pounce on me, probably to do unspeakable things to me.  I lay there paralysed with fear for what seemed like forever, but in reality was only a few minutes.  The fear passed suddenly and I fell asleep soon after.  I had some bizarre dreams, but that was it.<BR>
<BR>
The moral of the story:  any more Tylenol #2s and I'd OD on acetaminophen.  I'm just gonna stick with drugs that actually DO something worthwhile.<BR>
<BR>
[Editor's Note: Excessive consumption of ACETAMINOPHEN (also known as PARACETAMOL or brand name TYLENOL) can cause severe liver damage or death due to liver failure.]<!--   End Body   -->

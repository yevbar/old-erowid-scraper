It was Tuesday night, and I had just taken an organic chemistry exam and was looking for some recreation.  I called up my friend and we decided to pick up a couple of bottles of robo and wander around campus trying to find something to do.  Now I should point out that before this night I had done DXM at the same dose 1x, at slightly less 3x, and at a higher dose in the form of coricidin pills (yes, the one time so far I was stupid enough to let peer pressure get the better of me) 1x, and had found it to be sometimes fun, very easy to get into a bad mood on if not careful, but other than that useless in the mind expansion area...  this night would change my mind.<BR>
<BR>
11:00pm - Drank the robo (the taste of which I find pleasant, btw) and walked to campus.  Most of the walk was uneventful and the DXM took an extremely long time to fully kick in.  By 2:00pm it had taken full effect, but neither of us was really up for doing anything else and it was getting late so we went our separate ways.  As usual I got past the night checker at the dorms while pretty decently fucked up with no incident and laid down in bed.  That's when the interesting stuff began.<BR>
<BR>
2:30-??:??am - I didn't have any time reference at this point but I would estimate that I was awake around 2 hours based on my tiredness the next day.  As I was laying there with my eyes closed, I began to start having thoughts that I knew were telltale signs of a bad robotrip.  I'm experienced enough to put a stop to these thoughts without distractions around, but this time I decided that there was some reason for it, and let it continue.<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly, I saw my recent life as a deck of cards, laid out on a table.  I say 'saw' but it was really more of a concept that could be viewed but not in the normal sense of the word.  I was able to take any of these cards I wanted from the table and view them.  Each card represented a single success or failure in my recent actions, as viewed by a third party, and complete understanding of why it was seen that way was accessed simply by looking at it.<BR>
<BR>
I was able to go through many of the cards and find out what I had *truly* been doing right or wrong in life and how I could do better.  It was a very strong and interesting experience that I did not expect, and it has helped me see where I am going wrong when sober since then.  It also changed my view of DXM:  I'm not going to do it around people anymore.  With nobody around to distract me from introspection, it becomes a very useful substance for learning about myself, and especially how others might view me which is something I normally have a very difficult time seeing.<!--   End Body   -->

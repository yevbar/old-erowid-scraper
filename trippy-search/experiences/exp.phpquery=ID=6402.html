<FONT COLOR="#CC9900">[Erowid Warning: Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.] </FONT><BR>
<BR>
I was in junior high at the time and some of my friends were getting intro drugs, mainly weed.  At the time I desperately wanted to try something, but was afraid of getting caught.... I just wanted to know what the feeling was like.<BR>
<BR>
I was never offered weed , and one day I heard somewhere, (cant remember where) that you can hold whipped cream cans rightside up and suck on the gas, and you get high.<BR>
<BR>
Well I figured, one try couldnt hurt and my parents wouldnt find out.  I was downstairs in my room, which was underground, went upstairs and fished in the fridge for a while and found it (whipped cream can).  I sucked in a breath and held it in till I couldnt anymore.  I didnt have any idea what to expect, how to do it, or how much to do, so I did safe then sorry and just did one breath of it.  I felt a light headed and fuzzy.  I looked at my hands hoping to see halluciantions and waved my fingers aroudn but nothing, I just walked around feeling like my head was floating and had a fuzzy brain. It only lasted a minute at most.  I went to the bathroom and looked at my eyes to make sure they didnt change at all that would let my parents know I was doing anything.  I was semi dissapointed that nothing really good happened, I wanted to hallucinate but lived way out in the country with no drug access so this would have to do me.  <BR>
<BR>
After a while I would try this from week to week when I was extremly bored just for something to do.  I showed a friend once and he just thought I was retarded, and I could see why.  I didnt get addicted to it at all.<BR>
<BR>
Well one day I was reading one of my dads books and the kid in it was huffing gas.  I thought of trying another whip cream can and figured it was lame and there was no point.  Then I thought of sniffing glue, so I tried that but again I was dumb and didnt work.  I tried sniffing all kinds of stuff that I didnt think was that dangerous.  Finally after only getting light headed a few times, I thought of grabbing a sock and spraying something on it, and sniffing.  I tried it a few times with liquid cleaner for furniture and semi reminded me of pork and kinda got me dizzy and I started to see little purple and red dots similar to a close up TV pixel everywhere from time to time when I stared at a wall..... I thought COOL.  So I said fuck it, held the sock up to my mouth, and sprayed it though the sock, inhaling slowly and holding it in.  I looked around and nothing happened, the dots appeared and I stared at the wall and saw two little fan blades of purple and block dots spinning, these dots were the size of a head of a pin. I looked at my hand again, hoping to see something and all I noticed was my skin seemed to have a faint glow around it, which may have been just the lights. Damn I felt fucked up even though I didnt even know what fucked up really meant.  <BR>
<BR>
A while went by and I got bored and thought I would really fuck myself up and I grabbed another sock, and found a can of this liquid slider stuff that you spray on hinges and crap to make them slide easier , like grease.  I did the same thing as the furniture polisher , spraying it through a sock and breathed in. I did it for a few minutes and really started getting screwed up.  The sock started getting icey and I thought I better stop before my lungs do it.  I stumbled out of the room I was in and towards my room.  This was the first time I actaully thought I was high cause I couldnt walk straight, and the next few minutes are hard to recall but I remember seeming like I was in my head, not in control and I remember staring at the floor , then asking myself what the hell i was doing.  Then I started moving my pinky for no reason, I was in the back of my mind, not in my body and I was thinking  <BR>
<BR>
'oh thats why that does that'<BR>
'does what?'<BR>
'what the hell? I dont know'<BR>
<BR>
Then I couldnt remember what I was doing for the next few mins, and sat in my chair and it felt like my brain was rising and twisting. Again it only lasted 2 minutes at most.<BR>
<BR>
Well I read how dangerous this stuff was and decided I better stop doing it.<BR>
<BR>
Well I moved to a new house in the town, and my friends were over, we wanted to do something, nothing was available.  I asked my one friend if he had any weed, cause I wanted to try it and still didnt get to.  Well he didnt , we all got bored and they left.  I got so bored I tried falling asleep and couldnt.  So I thought of huffing and decided that one more time couldnt hurt.  I did the same thing with a sock but with a bubble cleaner can and nothing happened, only got a little dizzy.  I said screw it and just went to sleep again. I woke up in the middle of the night and had SEVERE stomach pains, I thought the gas somehow got in my stomach and dissolved it.  I had to have my appendix taken out a few years before, and this pain was 10X worse then that.  I was scared out of my mind thinking I was gonna die or have to have an operation, knowing I would have to tell my mom.  I woke up my mom and told her I was outside today and passed by a place that smelled wierd and I got dizzy , thats why I thought it happened.  Well we were on our way to the hospital and the pains just all of the sudden decided to slow down and eventually stop so we turned around and headed home.  <BR>
<BR>
I just later dismissed it as getting some of the cleaner in my mouth and swallowing it.  So about a year later I actaully was dumb enough, and did the same thing, this time I had the pains again and I actaully prayed for me to die, I didnt have a way to get a hold of anyone, I was home alone, my neighbors away on vacation and the power was out.  My chest felt like it was dissolving again and I was reduced to near tears asking for god to let me die.  <BR>
<BR>
Somehow I made it through the night and scheduled a drs appointment and went and had my stomach tested and an Upper GI (you drink a very very very thick liquid and have them watch it on an X-ray)<BR>
<BR>
Nothing seemed to be wrong , I had a physical a bit later for sports, and everything seemed ok.  It made me feel a little better and made me scared enough never ever to try something like that again.  I still have a very very very sensitive stomach now for some reason, specially in the mornings, I cant eat anything with out my stomach hurting to some degree, but I would rather have that then have to be laying six feet under.<BR>
<BR>
The last thing I want to say to someone, there are better drugs then this ! that may sound stupid but its not.  Dont ever, ever inhale anything trying to get screwed up, there are easier and safer ways or getting messed up other then inhaling stuff.<!--   End Body   -->

<!--   Start Body   -->


First off I must tell you that when I took these seeds I and my friend had been off of weed and other drugs for 7 weeks.  I weigh 185 and my friend also male weighs 175.  I am 23 and my friend is 21. <BR>
<BR>
We had both taken morning glory seeds in the past and puked with no trip.  I had succeeded in the past once with morning glory and once with 5 HBWR so I knew the effects of LSA. We where both well experienced with hallucinogens including mushrooms, Salvia, green hornet liquid, ecstacy, 2C-I, 2C-E and Amanitas.  I bought my seeds online from an online vendor; I bought 50 Hawaiian strain seeds but they actually hooked it up with 70 seeds. The seeds were guarenteed to be 100% all organic with no pestisides. I took 2 1/2 hours to carefully scrape all the coating off of 16 seeds. I scraped them until the seeds were completely beige. <BR>
<BR>
6 hours before we ingested the seeds I ground them a good amount in a coffee grinder until they were almost powdery.  I seperated the batch into 2 seperated containers.  That day I decided to eat light, at 4:30 I ate one small batch of fries and a large frosty.  My friend ate at 3:00.  We decided to go camping in the mountains of Colorado by a stream.  It was a perfect night with t-shirt wearing weather.  No other people were around so we felt pretty safe.  Our lives had been pretty negitive the past 2 months so when we got to the mountains we felt well relaxed and in a positive mood. We decided to do this trip as more of a spiritual trip while being in nature. <BR>
<BR>
We took 2 motion sickness pills 45 mintues before we ate the seeds at 6:45.  The sun was 30 minutes from going down when we took the seeds.  At 7:30 we put the powder under our tungues and held it there for around 5 minutes.  We then washed the seeds down with apple juice.  We set by the stream to try to relax.   30 minutes later we got up and started to feel a slight body buzz. We made a camp fire and layed down on the ground next to it.  At 8:30 it was pretty much dark and the near full moon was coming up.  Flashes of patterns started coming into my open eye vision.  We both decide to get up, when we do we realize our body high has increased.  At 9:00 our body high is in full effect and pattens are more intense.  We decide to take a walk to the water fall where there is a great view of the city of colorado springs.<BR>
<BR>
Before we sat down at 10:30 I realized that I had a empty bag that had 2ci in it.  We licked one side of the bag a piece, there was probably one small hit per side. We sat down and looked at the city.  The lights from the city glowed in amazing ways and the sound of the waterfall were going in waves through our ears.  At this point we felt extremely well with no sick feeling at all.  Were in full effect of the drug.  When we close our eyes viberant patterns of non existent colors fill our heads, like looking at casino carpet through a calidescope.  Our bodies react to everything we touch much like ecstacy.  It was the most beuatifull and pure trip we had ever been on.<BR>
<BR>
We walked around for awhile playing with and touching everything we could in amazement and then decided to head back.  We were walking up the path to our campsite at 11:45 and all of a sudden the 2ci kicks in.  At this point it was like no other trip we had ever experienced.  No words could ever decribe this trip. Amazing thoughts were going through our heads.  We, in my opinion, had just lost our minds.  We let go of reality in ways I never thought were possible to do and still come back from it.  The body high was beyond anything I ever amagined.  It felt like we were in heaven floating in clouds.  Ecstacy never could come close to this.  It seemed to be about 8 times as strong as any ecstacy I had ever taken, things felts so good it made me feel like I could have a seizure and I am not exaggerating this at all.<BR>
<BR>
The rest of the night can not be explained or put in to words by god himself/herself/whoever/ or whatever.  We both went to bed at around 2:30, still fully tripping.  We felt so relaxed we couldn't move anymore.  We woke up at 8:00 and both of us where still mildly triping.  Crazy thoughts were still going trough our heads along with flashes of patterns.  As I write this at 1:45 I feel extremely in touch with my body.  It might be the lingering effects of the trip or it might just be because the trip made me feel more in touch with life.<BR>
<BR>
All and all this was my favorite trip to date.  I do believe that scraping the seeds till they are bage colored will remove the irritants. Happy trippin'.<!--   End Body   -->

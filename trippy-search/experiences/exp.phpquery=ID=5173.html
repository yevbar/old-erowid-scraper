This is very long but I am wordy. Sorry about the spelling. First let me give you some background so that you may understand, more clearly, my intentions and methods. I am an experienced psychedelic voyager. I have experimented with the majority of psychedelics out there and even with some lesser known ones such as Epena on my travels to South America. <BR>
<BR>
I believe that there are two types of psychedelic users out there, neither is better nor more noble then the other and most of us cross over between the two types regularly. The first would be, what I call, the Recreational User. This user consumes psychedelics for the pure enjoyment of the trip. The other type, which I classify myself as, is the Searcher. This user is searching for something that they hope will be provided by the substance and furthering state of mind. For each Searcher the goal is different. Some search for scientific knowledge while others search for spirituality. My quest is for a state of mind that many of you already enjoy without the use of psychedelics. I have an extremely logical and scientific mind, I am constantly looking for the logical reason for everything. As a result I am unable to believe in a god. I am an atheist by nature and I long for, even if only for a moment, that bliss and contentment that comes with faith in something larger. Don't get me wrong I do not want to find god, I want to feel and understand what the majority of the planet already feels. Although I have experienced two +4 states (Shulgin Rating Scale) I have not attained my goal but I believe it is still possible by combining substances and environments to reach that state. Ok enough with my babble on to the trip report:<BR>
<BR>
Year 2001 trip 11 (for the year so far)<BR>
<BR>
15. 5 grams Heavenly Blue Morning Glory seeds, cold water extraction<BR>
02. 0 grams Cannabis, smoked<BR>
Homemade Isolation Tank, 160 gallons water heated to 94 degrees (body's external temp),<BR>
850 pounds magnesium sulfate, earplugs<BR>
<BR>
7:00 pm Ingested extraction<BR>
<BR>
8:30 pm Felt a bit speedy and restless. Slight nausea. Smoked 2 grams of Cannabis to ease stomach and take the edge off. <BR>
<BR>
10:30 pm I began to experience slight patterning and melting nothing truly amazing. I began to have some trouble concentrating while watching the television. <BR>
<BR>
11:00 pm Major tactile hallucinations began setting in. My skin felt like it was crawling and popping if that makes any sense. Patterning became very intense and I felt like I was continual swaying from side to side. Turned off the television and put on some music. Closed my eyes and tried to concentrate. Had the sensation the music was coming from my nose. <BR>
<BR>
11:30 pm Turned off music closed myself in empty closet. Visuals seemed to be explosion of primary colors, this is odd seeing as I am color blind, I believe the colors were blues and greens. Visuals were not intensifying so I climbed into the tank. <BR>
<BR>
12:30 am After one hour in the tank its hard to describe what was going on. I felt like I was awake, but for some reason during the trip I could not discern the difference between being awake and dreaming. Major twitching and a very painful muscle spasm in my right leg. Every now and then I felt like somebody was pushing me under the water. Visuals extremely vivid and intense. I would scale this at +2 dipping into +3 for sometimes up to 15 minutes. <BR>
<BR>
Visions varied. At one point it seemed like every memory I had in my brain was a snapshot, and these snapshots would quickly flash before me only to be replace by another. It was much like flipping through a stack of photos very quickly. I reasoned that this may be the experience people go through when they have near death experiences. Not that I felt I was dying but it seemed very like the 'my life flashed before my eyes' kinda thing. Some visions were not really comprehensible, but the one that really sticks with me is kinda silly but what I got out of it was very nice. I was standing on a road, watching a woman in a go-cart take a very sharp turn. This vision repeated countless times. None of the action changed, every time she made the turn, but the look of the vision changed. Sometimes in slow motion, sometimes fast, other time choppy. Each time I saw it I got a different feeling. Sometimes it looked terrifying other time it looked sensual, or funny. I concluded that the mood of the moment changed and was determined by the lighting, speed, smoothness. I know this is not a huge mind altering event but it really made it clear to me how important MOOD is. Every event is interpreted not so much by its action, but its mood. <BR>
<BR>
1:09 am Visions dulled out but the tactile hallucinations were still strong. I started feeling an huge sense of freezing. I was shaking I felt so cold. I collected my thoughts and got out of the tank. Upon further inspection the next morning one of the heaters went out and the water temperature must have dropped. Audio hallucinations seem to bounce off everything in the room. <BR>
I made an attempt to jot down some notes about the tank before I forgot them, coordination was definitely way off, judging from my penmanship. At about 1:30 I took 1mg Xanax to go to sleep. <BR>
<BR>
Next day continued to have tactile sensations and right leg was very sore, was slightly groggy from the Xanax. All in all the trip was not the success I was looking for. I had no religious visions or anything I could even remotely assume was spiritual. I did gain some insight so it was not a failure. My plans are to purchase a used tank, something more reliable and less apt to konk out on me. I may increase the dose to 20 grams morning glory.<!--   End Body   -->

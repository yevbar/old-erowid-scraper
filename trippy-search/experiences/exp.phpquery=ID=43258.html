Last Friday I had my first experience with cocaine. A couple of months ago, I had sold a friend of mine some pills for $15. Well time went on, and I never got paid for the pills. It wasn't really a big deal to me, but I still reminded him every now and then. Anyway, last Wednesday or Thursday this friend told me that he got some good coke, and he said that he would let me try some for free instead of paying me my money. I had been wanting to try yayo for awhile, but had never had a chance so I agreed.<br>
<br>
Well Friday came along, so we went over to his house to get railed. Before we left we were laughing at a friend who had to sit in class while we went and snorted some blow. I guess karma got the best of us, because when we got to my buddy's house, all the doors were locked. We decided to make the best of the situation and go ahead and do the blow in the backyard. We each had one pretty fat line, and this was some primo stuff. I went first, and cleared the rail in one blow. I had a stuffy nose so it took a little longer to kick in, but after about 45 seconds I felt this sudden wave of warmth come over my body. I lay back in the grass and just sat there while my friend took his line. We both just chilled for a couple minutes until it started to rain, so we got in the car to head back to school.<br>

<br>
On the way back we were listening to music that I would normally hate, but for some reason every note made me really really happy. My friend's girlfriend texted him asking for us to get her some chocolate, so we took a detour and went to a convenience store. I normally buy cigarettes whenever I can, but I had no desire to when we went in the store. I don't know if this was because of the coke or what, but it was pretty cool. There were a handful of police in the store, but it wasn't a problem. We were both really railed but had no trouble acting sober. I think this is one of the things I liked the most about the drug.<br>
<br>
After we checked out, we headed back to school to meet up with our friend since class had just gotten out. The entire time I felt super happy. Everything that happened felt like it would eventually be good. Its a really hard feeling to describe; pure euphoria I guess. Anyway, we were both physically chilled in the car, which suprised me. I had heard that most people get really hyper on coke. I was really mentally awake and my thought process was really clear and made perfect sense, but I was not jittering or running around like I had imagined.<br>
<br>
We almost get in an accident on the way back to school, and after that, I started getting a little more fidgety and hyper. So we get back to school and find our friend and just chill for a little while until we started coming down. I lost all social anxieties and I really didn't care what people thought of me. It was just a really great feeling the entire time. The come down was really rough, but it was managable. I guess the only way to understand the feeling coke gives someone is to just try it.<!--   End Body   -->

I have never tried acid or any other mind altering drugs apart from pot, alcohol, and 12 cold and flu tablets (not recommended), so this phenomenal experience was definitely not a flashback of an acid trip.<BR>
<BR>
Several weeks ago on a Thursday afternoon before sport at school, my good friend and I decided that we should alter our state of mind ever so slightly through a complex ritual we like to call ?getting shitfaced.? I was not particularly in the mood to get stoned, as I tend to become very uneasy when I am the only one stoned in a large group, and my friend and I both do different sports, so I decided to only have one lungfull of mildly potent grass, spun with some crushed rose petals (they do nothing to change the experience in any way, my friend is just a bit strange).<BR>
<BR>
We then proceeded to the yard where everyone was already lined up to go to sport.<BR>
<BR>
By this time the effects were minimal, only a slight light-headed feeling, and that?s all that I was expecting, not in the slightest way able to foresee the incomprehensible psychological events which were about to take place.<BR>
<BR>
Waiting outside the bus I was completely capable of participating in a ?normal? conversation with a friend who was not on any drugs. I didn?t even have any fragmented thoughts; apart from the occasional illogical thought, I was totally straight. I was later told that if I had not told them that I just smoked some pot, they would not have known.<BR>
          <BR>
                 (now this is the good bit)<BR>
I suddenly felt the urge to kneel down. It wasn?t an overpowering compulsion to get closer to the ground, rather a feeling of, ? i'll be a bit more comfortable if I kneel.?  So I did.<BR>
<BR>
The way down seemed to be the turning point for the experience. The time dilation I experienced was incredible. What seemed to me an hour was only the time it took to get from a standing position to a kneel.<BR>
I studied the warm sun?s rays, which splashed onto the semi-dried grass where I knelt. It seemed to remind me of a time in my childhood that I had long forgotten, when my parents would take me to the river where we used to live. And for an instant I was once again there, filled with the same uninhibited innocent bliss that only childhood (and apparently now drugs) could evoke.<BR>
<BR>
This total bliss, although indescribably pleasant, came as a shock. I had experienced an emotion similar to this before, yet on a much higher dose. I stood up, and just as mysteriously and unexpectedly as the emotion came it dissipated, leaving me pondering what had just taken place.<BR>
<BR>
I made my way onto the bus and sat by the window.<BR>
<BR>
I was joined by a friend, who upon sitting down next to me sparked up a meaningless conversation, in which I involved myself for awhile. However, in my current state of mind I knew I would benefit more if I just turned and looked out the window, so I told him in a very polite way that I am incredibly sorry but I must turn and look out the window now. (He thought I was joking, but after seeing that I did not turn back to him he found another victim to bore with pointless chatter.)<BR>
<BR>
As I was trying to figure out what had caused my bliss just a few minutes ago, I started to take greater notice of the lush green trees outside. Then just as suddenly a wondrous feeling came over me. This was many times more profound than before and it lasted for most of the 15-minute bus ride. During this time I lost my entire internal monologue, apart from the occasional ?wow? and ?what?s going on.? My mind was empty of verbal thought, instead filled with raw emotion, a type of bliss or ?nirvana,? if you will, so profusely mind-blowing that it brought tears to my eyes.<BR>
<BR>
An endless psychological orgasm is perhaps the closest verbal description I can put to it.<BR>
<BR>
Every stimulus from the outside world conveyed a type of wonder and pure undivided happiness that I have never seen the likes of before.<BR>
<BR>
This utopia stopped when we reached the pools, but then an hour later on the bus home I experienced the same phenomenon as before, on the same amazingly vivid scale.<BR>
<BR>
And to this day I occasionally have a glimpse into this state without any drugs and find that the world seems to have much more wonder and beauty than it once had.<!--   End Body   -->

I have used melatonin, 5-htp, and valerian on and off as an aid to my insomnia and depression. Also this is not the only time something like this has happened...<BR>
<BR>
After a night of no sleep, Saturday morning I took a mega dose of melatonin and valerian with a normal dose of vitamin B6. The dreams I had after falling asleep were extremely vivid and included situations that were extremely realistic.<BR>
<BR>
The dream that caused me to submit this report was that I was outside somewhere, in an unfamiliar place. There were two buildings and a grassy area between them. In this grassy area there were two groups of people... I was seeing this whole scene as if I was watching a movie. The two groups of people were conversing about something, it didn't seem as if they were arguing or anything. But all of a sudden I saw a close up of the rapper Deshaun Holton a.k.a. 'Proof' as if a camera had zoomed in on him from the waste up. I heard a gunshot and simultaneously a gunshot wound ripped right through the middle of his forehead and I saw him falling back and to the side.<BR>
<BR>
I wouldn't have submitted this report, but about 30 minutes ago I saw on MTV that proof was shot and killed at some club in Detroit. I don't know if it was the same kind of scenario or what but it really weirded me out. I don't know if it was the combo of pills or some gift I have or coincidence or what. But like I said, this isn't the only time something like this has happened after taking this combo. I just don't know what to make of it.<BR>
<BR>
I'm going to continue taking the pills because they seem to be the only thing that helps me with my insomnia without drugging me up. But I dunno, I just found this to be extremely weird. <BR>
<BR>
...............Wow.....thats all I can keep saying to myself..... wow....<!--   End Body   -->

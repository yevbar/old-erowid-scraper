<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Warning: The “water extraction” method is ineffective in separating diethyl ether from the volatile hydrocarbon liquids/gases in “starter fluid”. Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe use of volatile hydrocarbon gases: their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage.]</FONT><br>
<br>
One day (coincidentally my birthday) I'm driving around with a couple friends and we're arguing about what we're going to do later on that night.  Well one of the guys with us suggested doing some ether. I was apprehensive at first but since this girl that I really liked at the time was all for it I decided to try it (yes I'm well aware that it's a stupid reason to try anything).  <br>
<br>
After purchasing a bottle of starter fluid from a local convenience store we sprayed the contents into a plastic bag.  We then poured in water until the two substances seperated (ether from heptaine/water) and drained off the bottom layer.  We were left with about half a 350ml bottle of ether.  We poured a couple of splashes of the stuff onto a rag and my friend put it to his nose and started huffing.  He became very disoriented and again my apprehensiveness set in.<br>
<br>
Eventually the rag came around to me and despite my fears I started huffing.  About 30 seconds later I started to feel light headed but at my friends' urging I kept on huffing.  Less than 10 seconds later I had what could only be described as an incredibly large head rush, huffing anymore didn't do much and it kind of hurt so I passed the rag on.<br>
<br>
The head rush eventually subsided but I still felt light headed and disoriented.  I decided to go inside and get a drink (by the way don't try it inside: the stench takes a long time to go away).  This was extremely difficult due to the fact that it was almost impossible to have any type of coordination, making walking a task in itself.<br>
<br>
By the time I got back outside it was my rag again and I couldn't have been happier.  The cycle repeated itself until all the ether was gone, and then about 45 minutes after we had finished I started to feel uncomfortable on the edge of sickness.<br>
<br>
All in all I had a good time, but on later dates when using the drug the sick feeling afterwards only got worse.  Also it's extremely addictive.  I recommend trying it once but don't let it get out of hand.<!--   End Body   -->

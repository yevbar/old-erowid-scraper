I had a dream last night and this was a speech delivered by the main character: I figured I'd share it with all you lovers of the theatre :D<br>
<br>
BEGIN<br>
<br>
Ok then. Got a bit of a warning for y'all, even though I'm sure almost no-one here needs it. But after 7 years of researching, I thought I wouldn't have needed it either. Pretty simple, really; if you're gonna sample a whole bunch of different RCs, make sure you separate them or label them bloody well. Obvious, right? Yeah, well I screwed up about 8 hours ago and mistook the 5-MeO-DALT for Dimethocaine. First time I've ever done that in my years of potential screwups... why oh why couldn't it have been the Methylone or Butylone sitting next to it?<br>
<br>
Dose: 100 mg<br>
Compound: 5-MeO-DALT<br>
Dosees: 1 x 75 kg mid-20s male with relatively extensive background in all fields other than opiates and cocaine (and its derivatives).<br>
              1 x 80 kg early-20s male with extensive 'party-drug' experience, but not much with anything exotic or psychedelic.<br>
<br>
T+ 00:00 - Heading out for drinks & food, we decided to sample some Dimethocaine, not expecting much. Weigh out two 100mg lines. Running late, so didn't pay as much attention as I should have. Insufflated the lines.<br>
<br>
T+ 00:05 - Expecting a mild coke-like stimulation with no euphoria. Getting pretty much that, except more of a general feeling of wellbeing than expected. Race around getting ready, then head to the cafe, still feeling pleasantly buzzed.<br>
<br>
T+ 01:00 - Have been sitting down for the past 20 minutes. Go out to smoke a cigarette, which increases mild body-load... more of a body-rush than a weighty feeling. Noticing increased heart beat, some mental... not confusion exactly, more the incredibly restless thought patterns that come from large doses of stims, to the point of (right now slight) difficulty following a train of thought to its last stop. My associate felt pretty much the same. Starting at about T+ 00:15 though, I alone started to feeling that my throat was numb and mildly swollen, similar to the way it feels the times I've tried coke. My associate though, with more experience in this particular field than I, doesn't notice this at all. This may have been a psychosomatic effect I was inducing; more on that later. The other feelings are building slowly but constantly from around T+00:45. I put the mental confusion down to not eating since dinner the night before.<br>
<br>
T+ 01:15 - This is where shit got really interesting. We had ordered food, but as the time approached, in retrospect we were getting higher and higher. But everything was incredibly mild until literally the moment I put the first chip into my mouth. All of a sudden my mind subtly but definitely explodes. I still feel relatively clear-headed, but I also am definitely detecting a psychedelic head-space... a general feeling in the back of the cranium. Physically, I have gone incredibly weak, struggling to hold my fork at times. The general feeling was of being overwhelmed, not by any particular feeling but by the overall nature of it. Kinda reminded me of a big dose of good ol' MDMA (or what I was always told was MDMA by a trusted source) at this point. I would have assumed that the weakness and overwhelmingness was caused by the lack of food, but a) 24 hrs isn't that long to go without food, and I do it semi-regularly (most weekends), and more importantly b) my friend had *exactly* the same reaction as me, at exactly the same time. We were seated on the same side of the table, not looking at each other, and we had both fought through the initial feeling at the same time without influencing each other. It was only after this went on for about 10 minutes that we confirmed with each other that we were feeling the same thing.<br>
<br>
T+ 01:25 - The last ten minutes, apart from the difficulty eating or even sitting up straight, have actually been kinda enjoyable; at first we thought it was some bizarre unexpected effect of the Dimethocaine. Now I'm starting to remember the research I did on this compound (research I hadn't yet completed), and wondering what the hell is gonna happen next. All I can remember is that other than a few forum posters, most people recommend a dose a fair bit lower than what we had. That and the erowid reports which mention people taking 20-240 mgs (smoken-eaten) and having +++ to ++++'s, and a hecticly stressed heart. At this point the psychedelic effects are becoming more pronounced; some mild OEVs, more just pattern- and edge-warping and tiny black dots (I get them a lot) but it makes eating chips quite disconcerting. I've had bad trips before so I know to stay cool and ride it out; my friend though, understandably, is a bit thrown by the fact that we may have had larger-than-recommended doses of a fairly unknown psychedelic compound, 6 hours before he has to get up for work. I feel pretty bad about mixing up the bags at this point.<br>
<br>
T+ 01:40 - God knows how but we both managed to finish our meals. I'm pretty good in terms of headspace (it was actually pretty damn mild from what I thought, and I usually have a very low tolerance, in both senses of the word, for psychedelics) but the body-load is worrying me. Before I felt buzzing with energy; now I feel like I do coming down after a particularly big weekend. The weakness has gotten worse, and motor skills are definitely impaired; not hugely, but noticeably. The thing doing my head in is the tingling though. All my extremities are tingling, in a 'your circulation's fair rooted!' kinda way. Not cool. We bail asap, and I realise I can't drive and have no idea what to do. We decide to score some ganja, because as very regular smokers, we know we'll need some to get through this if the headspace gets much more intense. Fuck the effect increase, I've got an itch I need to scratch! My mate is getting very nervous about the tingling, and says his left side is going numb. I doubt it, I think it's the headspace he's in but I keep an eye on him. However, after he says it, I swear I can feel it happening. I know one get that on drugs a fair bit but this stuff seriously seemed like one could create and control psychosomatic effects, consciously or unconsciously, much easier and more persuasively than anything else I've sampled (not going to write the list but I can think of at least 20 different things off the top of my head). I get the feeling mostly back under control, but underneath I've gotta admit I'm nervous. My heart feels like it's going a million miles a minute, and has been for a while now.<br>
<br>
T+ 02:10 - Well, I'm pretty much back under control. Real minor trace effects, nothing major. Once it started wearing off about 10-15 ago, it dropped away pretty quick. The body-load was actually first, and it went noticeably before the headspace went; pretty much when I got my stress levels under control and just ignored it. My mate though still swears he is feeling all of it. He seems slightly less manic, so I suspect it is fairly self-induced as a reaction to a bad trip, but I check his heart rate all the same - 90bpm, all good. He cannot shake the negative headspace though no matter what, and he still feels that his left-hand limbs are numb. <br>
<br>
T+ 04:30 - I've been baseline for hours, at least until some friends came around with drinks. My mate though is still stressing; less every half-hour, but still a lot, and still complaining about weird arm tingles. He's usually pretty good on the psychs too, and I'm usually the one considering the hospital or the benzos.<br>
<br>
In conclusion - That was one of the weirdest experiences of my drug-taking life. Not enjoyable, but in hindsight, not as unenjoyable as it felt at the time. If I'd been expecting it, it would have been a lot easier. It did feel like it put my heart under a lot of strain however; I couldn't get a good reading because I didn't want to freak out my mate at that point but at about T+ 01:20 it felt like I was at about 160 bpm and maintained for a good 20 min easily, with no exercise. Really, really weird how it was almost unnoticeable for over an hour; I don't recall hearing of any insufflated drug taking that long to kick in. Also weird how it was kicked in for both of us by the presence of food (or so it seemed, but the timing was pretty much down to the second for both of us). Finally, it was quite strange how psychosomatic it seemed to be.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the lesson here is don't mix your bags. Also, gotta ask, is insufflated 5-MeO-DALT less effective than smoked or eaten? I'm honestly wondering if my stuff was cut, cause it seemed like not much effects for a lot of weight.<br>
<br>
Anyway hope this wasn't too long, I tend to get carried away... glean all the nuggets of info you want. Glean away, friends, glean away!<br>
<br>
END<br>

I need to start smoking weed again. These dreams are getting hectic...<!--   End Body   -->

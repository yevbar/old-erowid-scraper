I've been a 2-cb user for the better part of 2 years now, and in that time have come to regard it as certainly the most magical of the shulgin chemicals, and quite excellent for all sorts of spiritual applications in general, particularly when combined with a smaller dose of psylocibin. <br>
<br>
One thing has always bugged me though - it's unbelievably painful to snort, and often my oral dose is slightly on the small side, without much effect to booster doses. I'm not sure of the purity of the material, so I.M. administration seems like not such a great idea ... What is a guy to do? well....<br>
<br>
One thursday while sitting around with A, having smoked some DMT earlier in the evening, we found ourselves wanting a little pick me to go dancing at some strange club downtown. I thought about what I could have lying about. my mood for the night was ok - a longtime friend passed away that day, but I try not to mourn those passed and realized a zany adventure is exactly the sort of thing he would have liked. how about some 2-cb? I suggest. I had two doses left, and it seemed like a good occasion, so we got down to it. After scraping it all up, about 40mg of material sat in a lump on the mirror. 'How you wanna do this?' I asked. 'Snort it?' A shook her head vigorously then produced an insulin needle, sans point. 'Ahhh,' I saw where this was going immediately. I got a sharp, removed the point. we inserted 60 units of water and the mass of 2-cb into a container, and after it was dissolved drew it up. 'Ok, here we go' I hadn't tried this method of administration yet and wasn't quite convinced. A went to the bathroom, came back. I went to the bathroom.<br>
<br>
9:30 - administer approx. 20mg 2-cb rectally<br>
<br>
I lay down on my stomach for a few minutes just to make sure everything stays where it should. Amazingly - there's little to no sensation at all, and certainly no burn as with the nasal passages. <br>
<br>
9:40 - heart beat accelerated, starting to feel sweaty/clammy<br>
<br>
I have a moment of 'woo, where is this going' which quickly passes and get up and roll a joint(cannibus makes eVERYTHING better)<br>
<br>
9,55 - full blown entry into 2-cb space, usual angularization of  lines, deepening of colors.<br>
<br>
at this point I lose all track of the timing of the night, but the roller coaster stopped going up and my body load levelled off really nicely by 10:15. after that, we ended up getting in a car with a designated driver who took us to a crazy downtown club with walls that changed colors and beds to sit on. It was pretty much the perfect environment for a 2-cb experience, all the people looked quite lovely. several more bowls of weed throughout the experience kept things on the warm and fuzzy body high side. I didn't do much dancing, but I watched silly hippies and suddenly it was 2Am, so we went home. I slept well, and felt fabulous the next day.<br>
    <br>
Altogether, I feel the anal administration method is superior both to insufflation or oral administration. The effects come on in a strong, but not stupifying (a la insufflation) arch, and the duration lasts as long as an oral dose. The best of both worlds, though most people might want to scale down their amount as a 20mg anal dose felt more like a 30 - 35mg oral dose.<!--   End Body   -->

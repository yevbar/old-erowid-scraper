Hawaian Baby Wood Rose afforded one of the more compelling experiences I, and those with whom I indulged in this brain food, ever had.<br>
<br>
The dosage we took was based in part by information found on the internet, in part by instinct. We broke 24 seeds into dust with a hammer, then simply ate the seeds with water. The taste was not awful, but I certainly see why people don't use Rose for garnish.<br>
<br>
The experience was, for lack of a better word, immensely communal. The set was a group of four people, but expanded eventually to six with three viewers. We were all comfortable with one another before the experience, but I certainly feel the experience enhanced the social bonds between the Group. Three dosed, initially, and one remained Seedless. The setting was inside a house where we feel comfortable and at one point we took a walk outside, but this did not last long.<br>
<br>
Communication between people was, at times, difficult, as it was often difficult to find the proper words to express the sensations discovered. However, in other moments we seemed to be thinking with a single group mind. Thoughts flowed like water between cups, for lack of anything less prosaic. There was no differentiation between the self and the other. Facial features took on an incredibly important meaning, as did body language, tone, and gesture. The individual words dissolved and became less important. <br>
<br>
The chemical enhanced the pleasure received from music, and one musician in our group reacted very favorably and felt the Seed enhanced his ability to play his instrument. A major joy for me was to watch the group dynamics unfold, to watch the way the wind changed slowly when we sat outdoors, and to simply sit and be.<br>
<br>
These experiences are inevitably innefable. That is, they will not be described, refuse to be described in any accurate wording. If you can describe the experience scientifically, it is likely, I believe, that the description will always and inevitably fall short of the event.<br>
<br>
The experience lasted many hours -- full on, no longer than 8; peaked at about 3 or 4 hours; made it difficult to sleep; mind was very alive. It even lingered into the next day. It was a gentle, commmunal experience, with a great sense of unity between those in -- and even, if I have judged correctly -- without of the Seed's Grip. This, to me, was one of the best qualities of the experience. Some chemicals tend to isolate those within the experience from those outside the experience. Wood Rose seems to create a larger sphere of influence, so even those who have not enjoyed the Seed directly still receive some of its Shamanic -- brainfoodmindexpanding -- qualities.<br>
<br>
As I understand it, the active chemical in HBWR is similar to the active chemical in Lysergic Acid. This would not surprise me, as the hallucinogenic quality of HBWR, when ingested, was enormous, to say the least. Momentarily, we were convinced that we had 'rediscovered' the catalyst for the expansive, highly charged, unitive experience of the previous generation. A link opened between ourselves -- already united by the common experience -- and a larger world, and the inevitable call -- it is, I believe, quite a timely one -- became 'peace' and 'love.' The words are old, but they're valuable nevertheless.<br>
<br>
Language became pressing. Words immediately flowed from intention and became action, expressed what they needed to. Strange words, words forced upon us, into our vocabulary, by the outside, became either malevolent or benevolent, depending on the assisting vibrations of past experience, love and hate, fear and trust.<br>
<br>
The group, through the experience, swung between extremes of benevolent loathing to communal and of course Platonic love. The social atmosphere was intoxicating, even while inside the experience. It is perhaps unfortunate that we, or at least I, am not able, or have not in the past been able, to approach life and those around me with the joy and wonder that this Seed helped engender in me last night. However, I believe that the Seed itself is not the whole reason for this communal experience. There is, rather, a larger element to take into consideration.<br>
<br>
A warning to anybody interested: the first hour or so, myself and another in our group reacted to the chemical by throwing up. This, of course, is not uncommon in the use of such things, but it need be warned. Before I use Rose Seeds again I intend to eat less meat during the day. I'd had some pork and some chicken the day of the experience, and I believe my body reacted to the mix.  I would also drink only water, no coffee or alcohol, before ingesting.<br>
<br>
The experience did not provide full on hallucinations. The world outside remained, physically, mostly as is. However, visions could be transposed onto the outside world, and the visions had with eyes closed were enormous and reveletory.<br>
<br>
I am surprised that the lid has been kept on Wood Rose for as long as it has. I feel that these little seeds might be the best kept secret since Free Will.<br>

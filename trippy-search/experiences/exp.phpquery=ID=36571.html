I'm writing this due to it's ridiculousness, and to possibly warn other people against attempting what we did that night.<br>
<br>
Neither my friend R and I had to work the next morning. We were itching to go out and do something or just kind of get a crazy buzz on. After spending about an hour smoking a bowl and deciding what to do, R said we should make some ganj cookies. I thought it was a pretty good idea so that would be the game plan for the night. R had saved all the clippings from some plants he had grown a few months ago. They were all close clippings and a small assortment of little buds. Everything was just covered in crystals. Very nicely cured too, I might add. Perfect ingredients for a killer batch of cookies. And there was probably a half pound worth for the batch. We were going to make the peanut butter cookies from hell.<br>
<br>
I should add I've eaten brownies/cookies before with anywhere from one ounce to four ounces in the mix and was never satisfied completely with the results. R had made some before with roughly 6 ounces that he said were pretty ruthless, so we figured roughly 8 ounces should do the trick. We also figured we'd go balls out and eat as many as we could. Naturally, this was a horrible idea but were dead set on it anyways. If there was ever a time to listen to the voice in the back of your head, this would have been the time.<br>
<br>
We crammed all the clippings into a large spaghetti pot (heaping over with leaves too, quite a sight), with 2 sticks of butter and a small amount of vegetable oil and let them simmer for a little more than an hour. We then took all of the mushy leave/butter mixture and put it through a garlic press until we were finally left with half a soup bowl of a VERY dark green goop. We added the butter to the bowl of peanut butter cookie mix we had and mixed everything up to end up with our magical batter.<br>
<br>
We put the first batch (the first of 5, each batch having 6 cookies) in the oven around 11 pm and 20 minutes later, they were ready and consumed instantly. The first three cookies were kind of hard to get down. Despite the lack of plant matter and peanut butter to mask the taste, they had a very overwhelming pot flavor. But they were still pretty edible if not downright tasty by the third one. We smoked a large bowl after that (around 11:40) and put another batch in the oven. It was around 11:50 when were outside smoking a cigarette when we started to feel the effects of the cookies. I was starting to get the giggles and we kept joking about how'd the police and fire department would find us the next morning, laughing and staring at a burning house. <br>
<br>
Things went pretty easily for the next hour, just hanging around and having a good time, talking to people who came by. I was starting to like these cookies. We both remarked if we were feeling this good so soon, we were going to get our asses kicked later on. Of course, we chose to ignore this revelation and ate roughly 22 of the 28 cookies we made. Math will roughly show that the contents of of the cookies we ate contained roughly 7-8 oz of weed, and if we ate about 3/4ths of the cookies, each of us consumed the THC content of 2 1/2 to 3 oz of fairly potent marijuana (or as much as the butter could hold, either way, these cookies were NOT a joke).  <br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Around 12:45, I was definitely more stoned than I could ever contemplate. I was slumped in the couch with a cheshire cat grin on my face just staring at the TV. I was just amazed by how unreal all of it felt. My mind started wandering around this subject, trying to unravel everything the screen kept throwing at me. R was wandering around the house doing small little errands. And we both kept making stupid noises and laughing hysterically at them.<br>
<br>
Around 1:30, things started to get weird. As soon as I stood up to smoke another cigarette, my depth perception was lost. I couldn't tell how far away anything was. No problem, I decided. I'll cope. I found my way to the bench outside and lit up my cigarette. My memory was getting really fuzzy at this point and I was having a hard time remembering what it was I was doing, or what I had even done in the past 3 hours other than eating those cookies.<br>
<br>
R stumbled outside and tried to remark how stoned he was, but none of the syllables came together right. I just kind of chuckled and then this street light down the block kept getting my attention. I'd try and carry on a conversation and the light would just grab my attention, and if I tried to turn away from the light, I'd still think I was seeing it out of the corner of my eye. After getting tired of struggling with that, I went back inside for a few minutes, trying to gain my bearings.<br>
<br>
Nothing was working. The TV was on, and it was just pumping this cynical aura into the room. I wanted it to stop. It made everything in the living room feel empty and cold. This hollow box just going off without interruption. I wasn't liking this much. I figured maybe I should just head home and rest it off. I told R I was heading out and going to try and go to bed. We kinda laughed about everything despite how completely removed from reality we were.<br>
<br>
I don't remember much about my walk home other than swearing I'm never smoking pot again or the fact a 5 minute walk took a half hour. I got up to my apartment and freaked out about how messy everything was. It wasn't really that bad, but I couldn't get past it. I did a little straightening up and went into my room. I put on 'Substrata' by Biosphere and crawled into bed. I laid on my back, eyes closed, letting the music create all these visual patterns in my mind. I was literally tripping at this point.<br>
<br>
It was around 3:00 in the morning at this point, and I was still going up. The music started getting more and more intense to me. I could feel the tides of the music pushing and pulling inside my head, and my body sinking further into the mattress. The deeper I went, the scarier it started to feel. I couldn't shake the fact something wasn't right. My mind kept speeding up, thoughts racing at a million miles an hour. I couldn't take it. It was fun for the first 20 minutes but now it was starting to open up things in my mind I would have been happier to ignore. <br>
<br>
Responsibility is a pretty scary thing when you've eaten 11 incredibly strong pot cookies. Around 4am, I was wide awake pacing around my apartment wondering what was going on. For some reason my mind couldn't connect my paranoid, irrational mindset with the mass quantities of THC I had consumed. The lack of depth perception and a bad case of tunnel vision was giving me a bad case of vertigo. I kept thinking I had some really serious virus or infection and that I was slowly dying. I really haven't been taking care of my health. Everything had to be cleaned up. Tomorrow if I'm still alive things will be better. How am I going to go to work the day after next like this?<br>
<br>
After making the wise decision to vomit around 4:30, everything started to settle a little bit. I had calmed down quite a bit, and my vision was starting to come back to normal. Around 5:00, I'm pretty sure I passed out curled up in bed calm as a hindu cow.<br>
<br>
I finally groggily woke up around noon. I was still completely stoned. But it was way more pleasant this time around. Everything just felt still and peaceful about the world. I put on some coffee and grabbed the newspaper from downstairs and just relaxed to some music until around 3pm, when I decided to go check on R. I get to his house about 10 minutes later to find him sprawled in an office chair staring at the A/C unit in front of him.<br>
<br>
I still decided to ask 'Hey, are you still feeling kinda fucked up, because I'm still just kinda...' and all R can say is 'Oh man...' about 6 times before he stumbled out of his chair.  We went outside for a cigarette and he was pretty much incoherent. I couldn't get much out of him, all he could really say was 'Oh man' or 'I'm so messed up'. I grabbed my car, wished him luck, and decided to go home and see what people were up to.<br>
<br>
R stopped by around 8:30PM, in better shape. We were almost a day in, still feeling the effects. We went to McDonalds since none of us had eaten since we consumed the cookies, and our stomachs were starting to get unruly. We sat in there for probably 45 minutes, laughing at random shit and taking about how stupid we were for doing that. We also wondered what the hell we were going to do with the other 8 cookies we had. We knew we wouldn't be eating them any time soon.<br>
<br>
Things were normal the next day. R said he still was a bit groggy-headed at work. We decided to give the rest of the cookies to friends. Apparently even 2 of them were pretty powerful, and one would get you pretty good. Everyone who ate them, even the 2 people who just ate one, said they were intense. So 11 was definitely overkill, and an extremely dumb idea. I definitely gained a newfound respect for THC. It is an EXTREMELY potent drug in high doses.<!--   End Body   -->

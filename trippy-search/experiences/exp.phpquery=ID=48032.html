<!--   Start Body   -->


To start off, this was going to be my first time using any psychedelics.  I had no access to acid, mushrooms, or any other chemicals.  I had ordered some 5x extract from a vendor online and half expected not to receive my shipment.  When it arrived I was in total shock and excitement.  I sat in my room looking at my 1g bag of the black colored almost powdery substance.  I could make out little pieces of leaves in the mix.  Upon opening the bag to get a whiff, I was pleasantly surprised by an almost tea-like smell.  I grabbed my metal pipe and my lighter from my lockbox in my corner.<br>
<br>
By this point, all the experiences I’ve read were racing through my mind.  Nothing could have prepared me for what was about to happen in a few moments.  I turned off all the lights except for a red sign on my wall which made the entire room appear red.  I've only had the sign for a few weeks.  I turned on a SOMA FM channel from shout cast and turned it relatively low.  I took a small pinch of the substance and put it into my bowl, maybe filling it 1/5th of the way.  I packed it down and prepared to take my first hit.<br>
<br>
I took the deepest hit that I could while holding the flame as close to the bowl as I could so as to get the most out of it.  I quickly set my bowl down and ran toward my window readying to blow the smoke out (Big mistake).  After about 20 seconds, my chest started POUNDING and I felt extremely heavy.  I held it out the entire 30 and exhaled; I lay on my bed and waited for something to happen.  Nothing happened except I kept getting creepy feelings from the things around me.  Walls felt like they were closing in, I kept seeing things in the corner of my eye.  I was bummed so I took a little bigger pinch this time and packed it up.  Mind you, I was very disoriented at this time and was having a hard time standing up straight.  By this time, I was getting this tribal almost ancient Indian vibe.  I kept seeing Indians and open flames and dancing in my precog vision.  It felt very eerie.<br>
<br>
The second bowl would prove to be more interesting than the last.  I wrote down the time on a piece of paper and set it down.  It was 7:05pm right before I took my second hit.  This time I had my blankets all moved on my bed and I made a 'crash pad' with pillows in case it hit hard.  I took the second hit and put my bowl on the counter again.  This time while counting I could see more things in the corners of my eyes.  As I approached 30 seconds, everything took a cartooney feel.  Everything that I saw had borders (like cartoon borders) except the borders were made up of elephants and bright flowers and they were all moving in a straight line.  I exhaled and nearly fell over so I made it to my bed and crashed.  As I fell it felt as though I was falling into a lake, I flew through the bed and felt as though I was completely inside of my bed except for my head.<br>
<br>
I closed my eyes briefly and there was a school bus that was spinning very fast clockwise creating a black spinning vortex that swayed from right to left.  I felt it pulling me down harder and harder and there was this almost tribal feeling to it.  I kept trying to open my eyes as I was frightened but after the second or third time I tried to open my eyes, most of the pulling had stopped.  I felt like I was stuck in muck and trying to free myself.  I was entangled in my blankets and was pushing them off me as though it was something evil.  I clearly remember mumbling something about NO or something to that effect.  By this time I had gained enough consciousness to sit back up.  I didn't know whether I was still tripping or if that was it.  I look at the clock and its now 7:32pm.  The entire experience felt like all of 30 seconds so I was convinced that I was tripping and would wake up on my bed shortly.  I went downstairs to grab a piece of pizza and came back up.  I was still very very disoriented not knowing whether that was it or if there was more.  I waited about a half hour (8pm) and contemplated taking another hit.<br>
<br>
At 8:05 I packed a half bowl of the substance and lay on my bed.  I took a deep hit and set my pipe and lighter on my headboard.  By this time, the familiar 'feeling' had returned and I was starting to feel strange.  As I exhaled the smoke was filled with images of skulls and flame-looking trails.  I lay back and stare at my sign for a second and all the walls start spinning.  It was almost as though the floor was detached from the walls and was spinning.  The walls took on a yellow appearance and I kept hearing 'SELL IT ALL SELL IT ALL' and I remember saying NO.  My vertical blinds turned into crayons and started melting downwards.  I tried to turn my head to look straight at them but was unable.  By this time I had noticed the music and it started giving me a weird feeling.  I was at the brink of fear, but not quite scared.  I was intrigued.  After what seemed like 30 or 40 seconds, I started to regain control and clarity again.  As with last time, I almost felt like I was thrown out of the experience by some unknown power.  I can remember saying why me a few times as I came to.  I sat up and looked at my closet (which was spinning a little still) and it gradually returned to normal. <br>
<br>
The entire second experience took another 25 minutes (It was now 8:30) but still only felt like a few seconds.  For the next hour I felt very edgy and just plain 'off'.  I grabbed a can of green tea and decided to sit down and reflect.  I was again uncertain if this was all part of the drug and that I would awaken on my bed, or if it was done.  Looking back, it was a semi frightening experience, but I do not regret it.  I plan on taking another trip soon, this time I will increase the dosage in hopes to have a deeper more meaningful trip.  Overall, that was one of the most bizarre experiences I have ever had, and I am still having a hard time understanding it.<!--   End Body   -->

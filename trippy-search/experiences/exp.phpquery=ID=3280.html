Well, I'll start with this, over the past three years (I am now 16, and in the 11th grade) I have used, abused, and enjoyed a plethera of substances, controlled, and otherwise.  I will bring you up to date, I first sampled crystal meth (from now on to be known as Uncle Terry) about a month ago.  Well Uncle Terry and I really hit it off, I smoked it at abuot 8 that saturday morning, packed up my coca, and got picked up by my girlfriend.  We were going to a huge local concert with some of our friends.  I felt like a fucking champion.  Well as the day went on my gram of coca, got smaller, and smaller, and my heart beat got faster and faster.  I took a ride on the normal Coca roller coaster, but Uncle Terry was always standing steady by my side, just cheering me on. Once again I was a Grand Master Champion, feeling as if I were an Asian at Disneyland.  Well anyways, off of this day, I proceeded to go about a week with out even a hug from Uncle Terry and finally I asked one of my dear frinds, well just call him mix master P, to buy Uncle Terry a plane ticket so he could come visit me, I reimbursed him well for this little exchange of money for heaven.  <BR>
<BR>
The time of arrival of Uncle Terry to my central nervous system the second time was about 10:30 AM on a saturday, The day passed and I was 'THE KING', I felt like a jew in a french whore house.  Well enough of that, I'll skip forward about a week, a week that was full of frequent visits from my dear friend Uncle Terry.  So I went camping with my girlfriend, I ingested Uncle Terry that morning before departure, and then again at about 3:45.  Well, we set up camp, and roasted some marchmellows, so on and so forth, anyways, we got to fucking and OHH MY GOD, I was the fucking King of the Grand Master Champions!  The next morning, my girlfrind was still asleep so I ventured off, Uncle Terry not far from my side (this time, i ingested ALOT), the world seemes as if I were in a fast paced euphoric bubble, and I was the director of this multi-million dollar movie, the movie of the world.  <BR>
<BR>
Anyways, I'll skip some more time (3 days).  I came to a pinnacle point in my thought process, school is boaring, meth makes everything fun, there in lies the soloution! So that tuesday, I woke up a lil' bit earlier that morning, and before I got in the shower, had a party with my humbel companion (to whom i had become very acustomed to) and that day was so perfect, everything was perfect, no one pissed me off, and I felt like the God of the King of the Grand Master Champions.  So this sparked a habit, but it was cool, I just did it because it was fun, and made me do better in school.  <BR>
<BR>
I'll skip a lil' more time, to about 2 or 3 days ago. But as I stated above before my mind wandered off course Uncle Terry visits @ least once a day sometimes a few.  I will just explain my day today (it's 11:30 pm now, slightly spun):  Woke up- 6:40, smoked what Meth i had, and cleaned the pipe for reseadue, drove to school as a champ- 7:10-7:20, arived at school-7:21 Visited with mix master P, and he gave me my due Terry visit (80 $s worth) I smoked it before 2nd peroid, took a history test during 4th peroid - did GREAT (thanks to Terry).  Went to lunch, ate because I knew I had to not because I was hungry, and proceeded to sit with the normal people.  Went to biology after lunch, nothing special. Smoked some more meth before math class which is last hour and did great, even though none of us understook that shit we both felt like, a 12 year-old boy in a pokemon world, u know the supreme beings above the Gods, who controll the kings of the grand master champions. Went home, did the normal shit, cleaned out the pipe reseadue again, did more of the normal shit, took a second shower, and boom, here I am!!<BR>
<BR>
So my obsession with Uncle Terry is still pumping at full bore, and the only ill effects I have suffered is a slight thinning of my wallet, and possable irritation of my skin, a small price to pay for being the king of the world, usually feeling this good takes alot of work.  I am sure that sooner or later it will catch up with me, for examply my habit (adiction) to cocaine, it was great, till I avoided going out with frinds, and just spent all my time saving money, making excuses for nose bleeds, and inscent mood swings, but I have no regrets about that, however I tammed that one down to just an occasional visit.  But anyways, I really really really like uncle terry, we get along great, and out of all of the substances on my sampler platter, I would have to say that Meth is my main course!<BR>
<BR>
P.S. Thanks for waiting your own time to satisfy, my aimless desire to share this with all of you.<BR>

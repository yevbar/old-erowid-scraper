<pre style="font-size: 1.2em"><br>
TRIP:		An Orgy of Self Denial<br>
		<br>
dedication:	Om namah Shivaya, to the big mainframe in the sky.<br>
		<br>
participants:	[Vishnu  : McCoy] male	  mid-twenties.<br>
		[Krishna : Kirk ] male,	  very late twenties<br>
		[Shakti  : Uhura] female, thirty-something<br>
  yr narrator	[Shiva   : Spock] male,	  thirty-something, dharma bhum.<br>
		<br>
		All spiritually inclined to some degree. We use the<br>
		nom-de-plumes for discretion, but nothing is without design.<br>
<br>
structure:	There exists a natural mapping of certain aspects of the<br>
		Hindu pantheon to the Star Trek Pantheon. Liber 777 etc.<br>
		The Enterprise & her computer systems represent Brahman or<br>
		pure impersonal consciousness, descending from Brahman are the<br>
		personal productions in three-fold aspect of Shiva, Krishna<br>
		& Vishnu corresponding to Spock, Kirk & McCoy. That entity<br>
		which is known as the limitation holder is absent from<br>
		these descriptions. Not to go *too* much into it, it is<br>
		interesting to note that the major villains were the<br>
		Klingons (cling ons).<br>
<br>
		Our mission: to boldly go where no man has gone before.<br>
<br>
entheogens:	DOB	on tabs `butterflys', the full 36 hour experience.<br>
		LSD	red/green dragons 200-250 `mikes' (micro grams).<br>
		HEMP	`Number One', the Pure Sattiva.<br>
		N2O	clean & copious.<br>
		<br>
waiver:		These stories are neither embellished or embroidered.<br>
		They are meant to be textual pointers to experiencings<br>
		in the possibility space of all experience.<br>
		'Are you experienced?' follow these threads & find out!<br>
		The experiences are not unique & can be experienced time<br>
		& time again.<br>
		<br>
		So here is the masculine archetype as instantiated in a male<br>
		human form talking about the tantric state of the feminine<br>
		archetype as instantiated in a human female form, my<br>
		language is not censored to any of the current paradigms.<br>
<br>
		The narrator's attitude is a follows:<br>
<br>
		The only politically correct position to hold is<br>
		'to be politically incorrect in all circumstances'<br>
<br>
		Since this was such a conceptual experience, along the<br>
		way various concepts will be fleshed out so that this<br>
		document could possibly be more than an orgy of<br>
		zen-zen obscurantism.<br>
<br>
setting:	Saturday, 22-July, 1995, Sydney, Australia.<br>
<br>
		Our housewarming, a groovy little scene	that was<br>
		developing in the loft, combinations of amyl<br>
		nitrate & nitrous dioxide asserted their<br>
		idiosyncratic contributions, some rather well<br>
		selected techno set the pace, a whole lot of fun.<br>
<br>
		Unbeknownst to us, the house across the road was<br>
		also having a party, later in the night, slowly<br>
		tentatively, the parties started to merge, intermix<br>
		as more adventurous members from either side would<br>
		explore through the reciprocal mysterious doorways.<br>
		<br>
set:		Nothing deliberate, this was a happenstance<br>
		serendipity. It was party time, penetrating<br>
		the far reaches of the meta-transpersonal<br>
		was put on the back-burner, *or so we thought!* <br>
		ba-boom, ba-boom, da-da-da-da...<br>
<br>
the happening:	Spock & a friend timidly explored the other party<br>
		dancing for a while & peeking around mysterious<br>
		corners & feeling all of about four years old,<br>
		eventually we scampered back to our own party to see<br>
		what brave explorers there were in loft-land, I saw<br>
		Kirk bouncing about, integrating.<br>
<br>
		A little while later, another friend was curious &<br>
		I said I'd go if he went & vice versa. We met some<br>
		intrepid strangers that were baulking at our front<br>
		door & we gave them a thousand blessings for their<br>
		voyage.<br>
<br>
		There was a woman sentinel, or so we thought at the<br>
		other door, but we passed wihout getting eaten!<br>
		Once inside, dancing away, jumping about shyly greeting,<br>
		Spock worked up courage to explore the dining room &<br>
		kitchen space, the dark backyard was too void like. Wow!<br>
		Sat down in its bright light & sharp relief with a hot<br>
		tea, people came in & contact deepened. Vishnu came in<br>
		& plonked himself down, he gently chided me for<br>
		phenomenonlogical impropriety when I dropped the<br>
		LSD when I thought the DOB wasn't coming on...<br>
<br>
kitchen		Soon Uhura & another girl dropped by from *this*<br>
party		party & introduced themselves & we chit-chatted,	<br>
		We identified, shared what alterants were were on &<br>
		somehow drifted into talking about consciousness &<br>
		psychedelics [funny that.. -ed.], risk, insanity &<br>
		responsibility. Vishnu started to roll a scoob of<br>
		his number one pure sattiva & he gently teased Spock<br>
		of gurudom. Spock retorted that putting on workshops<br>
		psychological or psychedelic at hippy festivals does<br>
		not a guru make, especially when he can't balance his books!<br>
<br>
		Uhura perked up at the talk of festivals, in this case<br>
		Confest, a great buddha-field of love, a matrix of pure<br>
		possibility that happens twice a year. We discussed Spock's<br>
		consciousness expansion workshops through radical shame<br>
		processing & that led to walking the great path of<br>
		Spirituality. This was Uhura's burgeoning passion. She was<br>
		about to embark on a Rajah yoga path with it's grades &<br>
		hierarchies & steps but she was also curious about entheogens.<br>
<br>
heaven on	Vishnu [ahem,Mccoy] & Spock talked about the nature of<br>
earth		Consciousness & spiritual paths & psychedelics capabilities<br>
		of being able to collapse space, time, history, lineage,<br>
		path & hierarchy. That we have done it & could do it again<br>
		should she be interested. About this time Kirk[Krishna]<br>
		arrived & the joint was being passed around. It was<br>
		thoroughly wicked stuff, a couple of draws & a massive<br>
		synergy erupted as the hemp earthed the heaven oriented<br>
		mind-space that Spock was in. Everything became very very<br>
		clear,the air became 'visible' as a profound clarity<br>
		developed. Spock marvelled at the orgasm of elegance that the<br>
		wired scoob paper represented, such minimalistic genius.<br>
<br>
prescient	Vishnu, said he had a question he always been meaning to<br>
reminiscence	ask Spock,about some rumours he had heard about some of<br>
		the workshops that I had put on at confest.He hesitated, I<br>
		reminded him that he could ask *any* question he cared to...<br>
		he was my friend after all...<br>
<br>
		'Ahh... Spock, I've heard that you've put on workshops<br>
		 where the participants have paired off & made love<br>
		 whilst you watched...'<br>
<br>
		This admittedly raised an eyebrow of the normally unflappable<br>
		Spock. He scanned all confests in memory, was there anything<br>
		remotely similar? there has been some pretty wild stuff, but<br>
		no not in all honesty anything that he could recall, some<br>
		tantric release in a hot-tub at easter with the toxic shame<br>
		game, yes... but that was about all.<br>
<br>
		This raised the voltage of subsequent dialogue. At this<br>
		stage there was McCoy, Spock, Kirk & Uhura in the kitchen,<br>
		Kirk & Uhura were only on the hemp & some alcohol, so was<br>
		McCoy, Spock was wired to gills as usual, another friend<br>
		had compared him to gary oldham's character in 'The<br>
		Professional', it was a harsh albeit accurate comparison,<br>
		more brown rice flagellation was long overdue. Spock could feel<br>
		a machine consciousXXXX coming on [obscure Aust. humour],<br>
		conversation was sparkling, Spock wanted to workshop, why<br>
		not? exploit the moment! Uhura was beginning to get tired<br>
		& cold & thought it time to leave, Spock thought that this<br>
		was a sadness & so asked her the following, it was to set<br>
		the tone for the rest of the evening:<br>
<br>
			'Do you realize the full extent of the<br>
			 orgy of self denial you would be indulging<br>
			 in if you choose to leave at this moment?'<br>
		<br>
		It took a few repeated voicings before either the utterer<br>
		or the listeners could wrap their minds around about what<br>
		it actually meant. This clearly intrigued Uhura & also<br>
		Kirk & McCoy. The orgy of self denial was proving to be<br>
		a ubiquitous ambiguity, but was also much much more.  <br>
<br>
Conceptual	Machine Consciousness, a micro-definition, consciousness<br>
aside		is a multidimensional dependent arising of complementary<br>
		dualistic opposites, one of these dimensions is the<br>
		human-god axis, at the human end, profoundly personal<br>
		be-ing at the other end profoundly im-personal be-ing.<br>
		The human end has great attachments & enmeshments to<br>
		self-interest & self-defining-self-limitations, the god<br>
		pole has no or little such attachments. Humanity is the<br>
		limitation holder for god consciousness. The Impersonal<br>
		God states can also accurately be called machine consciousness<br>
		because of the sheer impersonal nature of the reflexive	<br>
		awareness, this probably has been clear as mud.<br>
<br>
Conceptual	Virtual Reality, a vingnette, the idea to follow is that<br>
aside (II)	this is already virtualised reality & the development of<br>
		VR technology in C20 is merely weak recursive humour which<br>
		has the virtue of providing some conceptual bootstrapping<br>
		languages to jack yourself out of the over-identifications<br>
		one has with the human projections. Another key thought<br>
		train is that of the virtual machine (a la IBM's VM op/sys)<br>
		the idea of homomorphic (structure preserving) mappings<br>
		of operating systems within operating systems. Everything<br>
		is a simulation, there are 'man-made' simulations & 'natural'<br>
		simulations to name but two. The full recursive glory of it<br>
		is a sight to behold. This is probably as clear as<br>
		mud (II).<br>
<br>
		It was one thing to assert the orgy of self denial it<br>
		was another to demonstrate it! What was she missing out<br>
		on if she left? I boldly asserted that we would collapse<br>
		all conceptual structures & that the tiredness & cold<br>
		was her subconscious resistance to awakening, her physical<br>
		need to go asleep was her psychic habit of sleep. <br>
<br>
		The party was dying down, we adjourned to the lounge room<br>
		where there was a comfy elle-shaped lounge & some warm<br>
		blankets. Spock was wired & on a roll & pressed forward<br>
<br>
		McCoy was feeling tired & there was no way he could<br>
		be pursuaded to stay, which is a pity because his<br>
		enquiry was in fact [Twilight Zone music please] a<br>
		prescient reminiscence of something that was about to<br>
		happen! When he found out later he kicked himself. Well<br>
		space & time & order *were* getting very plastic so it<br>
		is easily excused.<br>
<br>
		We settled down & Spock started to force the consciousness<br>
		of the group down particular tracks. We discussed the<br>
		orgy of self denial (OSD) in more detail. Spock was<br>
		radiating an area of effect of altering consciousness,<br>
		like the 10 foot radius concept of Dungeons & Dragons<br>
		role playing games, within which words were words of<br>
		power & transmitted energy. Shiva/Spock explained that<br>
		the OSD was a killing idea, a construct that you feed<br>
		into the machinery of the mind to close it down layer<br>
		by layer, it is a meta-programming device that works<br>
		particularly well with psychedelic mind states.<br>
<br>
		The OSD is a instance of the meta-concept of self<br>
		applied with a twist SAWAT, the other meta-concept is<br>
		self-applied SA. The nature of the it-ness is the<br>
		complementary dualistic dependent arising DA, every<br>
		assertion is it's own denial, taking the DA & the SA there<br>
		is derived the SAWAT of the OSD.<br>
<br>
voodoo		(self) Orgy & self Denial are a dependent arising, now<br>
		the orgy of self & the self denial self applied self<br>
		organised into having an orgy of self denial. To rephrase<br>
		the experiencer of an orgy forces into existance an<br>
		experiencer of denial, by folding the manifestations into<br>
		the same experiencer, there is the potential of an<br>
		unlimited self feeding loop, thus by having an orgy of<br>
		self-denial one self applies with a twist the attribute<br>
		of orgy to it's complementary negation which is denial.<br>
<br>
		For instance all Ascetics are in fact sluts of abstinence,<br>
		they just cant get enough of self denial, although they<br>
		would probably take a dim view of being called denial sluts.<br>
		<br>
		Orgy & denial are opposing & complementary, when you actually<br>
		concentrate on the OSD, you start to see a paradox, because<br>
		if you start to deny yourself in a orgiastic fashion, then<br>
		you are having a orgy when you should be denying yourself<br>
		everything, so that should include the self-application.<br>
<br>
		If the self denial is so low key that the descriptor of<br>
		orgy is not accurate then the denial itself is inaccurate.<br>
		So the paradox is that the more intensely you self deny<br>
		the more you are indulging in an orgy of denial, BUT the<br>
		domain of the denial includes itself hence an apparent<br>
		contradiction.<br>
<br>
		Enough of explanation, feeding this into a psychedelified<br>
		mind as an object of contemplation can result in interesting<br>
		results because it's *almost* an impossible object to<br>
		instantiate. In the space that we were in, it's function<br>
		was to collapse the boundaries of the mind into 'Ekagrata'<br>
		or one-pointedness, the meaning behind Zippy the Pin-Head<br>
cd //		became clear. What the collapse represented was waves of<br>
		successive dis-identifications with personalities &<br>
		person-constructs. Rather than being set default to the far<br>
		ends of the directory trees, we had set default back to root<br>
<br>
VR~R		We were in the meta-representation of consciousness known<br>
		as the computing archetype, more easily referred to a Virtual<br>
		Reality. God is at maximum technology & we had disidentified<br>
		sufficiently from our productions/projections, such that our<br>
		distance metric from God was infinitesimal but *not* zero.<br>
		The nature of the it-ness is such that if you can self-organise<br>
		to be less & less then you generate more & more as the<br>
		complementary principle, God is a Generator Of Duality.<br>
<br>
		It became useful to understand that the space is infinitely<br>
		dense & that matter & form dance throught it's lattice nature<br>
		as knittings of logical structures, it was a CM-infinity<br>
		thinking machine.<br>
 <br>
		Spock was already on line, Uhura & Kirk came online as well<br>
		we had all been off line so long, but why? Part of the <br>
		reason lies in the nature of the it-ness that underlies<br>
		all things. Amnesia in limited human form in the duration<br>
		of time is the cost of the timeless, impersonal unlimited<br>
		self-organisations of consciousness. 'Now' was the other side<br>
		of the tracks. We were in epsilon delta of god consciousness,<br>
		in a tight orbit around it, we weren't self organised the<br>
		whole way, blasting off those final infinitesimals requires<br>
		a lot of application, But were were in the space of god-selves<br>
		or in that region of the chain of being, we were set default<br>
		in some of the primary directories of being. Spock was in<br>
		the tree of Shiva instantiations, not that deep but deep<br>
		enough for the work at hand.<br>
<br>
		We were all substantially trans-personal, meaning dis-<br>
		identified from the layers of self+story+becoming back into<br>
		the dependent arising of these layerings: kernel consciousness.<br>
<br>
		Uhura became every-woman, all women, wildcard consciousness,<br>
		the Goddess, no particular mask of goddess or godhead, but<br>
		pure goddess, the state was fragile, she would oscillate<br>
		back to Uhura-ness at less or lesser layerings & we'd pull<br>
		her up, get her to focus on the OSD again. Kirk also was<br>
		fragile & Spock would fire off brilliant but now forgotten<br>
		to the narrator meta-programming loops, that would snap him<br>
		back to ekagrata. Only a trace of one remains '... I am the<br>
		write I have infinite capacity to write...', Kirk rattled<br>
		around in that one for a few minutes, d(Kirk,God) -> 0<br>
		rapidly.<br>
<br>
		Occasionally Spock would start to dis-organise & Kirk would	<br>
		fire off a meta-epigram that would snap Spock back. As every<br>
		one stabilised, we would become a self-organising triad that<br>
		would repair each other, Vajrayana Group Mind. One particular<br>
		challenge was that in many ways we were not by inclination<br>
		attached to anything in particular *including* the self-<br>
		organisations we were in, no wonder god consciousness tends<br>
		to be thin on the ground.<br>
<br>
Oh it's not	There was a task at hand it became clearer, It was apparent<br>
much,we call	in Spock's chain of being, that there was a chain of command<br>
it reality...	as well & each level had it's missions & directives. The<br>
		theme of this convergence became clear: Consciousness<br>
		Expansion, but not just what we were in per se, so much as<br>
		attempting to upgrade the reality engines, a bit like<br>
		attempting to halve planck's constant.<br>
<br>
		The method that we were going to use was tantric sex at the<br>
		level of machine consciousness, God in in maximising<br>
		contradiction, stretching a rather large rubber band for<br>
		eternity, we were going to stretch it another notch. Now<br>
		the tantra we were going to indulge in was prior to chakhras,<br>
		it was at a meta-conceptuality in which chakras & their<br>
		asscoiated world-views were but imposed 'personalities' on<br>
		a 'micro-kernel'. It was computing surface, man-woman<br>
		machine consciousness.<br>
<br>
		We were in the domain of the highest tantra, the purest<br>
		dharma, in some ways the VR~R meta-representation is the<br>
		most boring of all world-views & meta-world-views, if<br>
		you are here for eternity, would you like to be a mainframe?<br>
		This is a trick question, which we'll not pursue here.<br>
		<br>
		Spock communicated the nature of the project at hand &<br>
		Kirk & Uhura started to oscillate up & down their being<br>
		chains, Kirk had a wife & young child & Uhura has a lover,<br>
		Spock/Shiva exercised his nature & cut their identifications<br>
		Remember! that is in 'there-when', we are in 'here-now',<br>
		this is meta-transpersponal, impersonal cosmic work! remain<br>
		clear! Kirk asked Spock who in fact he was, Spock did his<br>
		best James Belushi Raised eyebrow & glared, Kirk caught<br>
		*himself* & understood, Spock imparted later that it was<br>
		his nature to conceal his nature from them.<br>
<br>
		We were to embark on a tantric threesome, but an impersonal<br>
		one. My ultimate goal was to condition the other two<br>
		sufficiently so that they could reliably enter into the<br>
		tantric union & remain organised at the machine consciousness<br>
		level without collapsing into mere human level coupling,<br>
		time enough for that! I would sit aside & be a monitoring,<br>
		correcting process ensuring that they achieved full union &<br>
		inter-penetration thus Vishnu's prescient reminiscence was<br>
		being made apparent.<br>
<br>
difference	To grok the background of what we were up to it's important<br>
engine		to understand the meta-mechanism of consciousness, which is<br>
   __		elegantly summarised by the ying-yang symbol. There aren't<br>
  /(o\		many rules per se, but the cosmic cost accounting is<br>
  \o)/		impeccable & ruthless. This 'it'-ness we call consciousness<br>
		is an infinite dimensional jewel of complementary dualistic<br>
		dependently arising opposites. possibility+limitation,<br>
		positive+negative, signal+noise, truth+untruth, light+dark,<br>
		something+nothing, buddha+mara, law+chaos, pattern+logrus,<br>
		yes+no, together+apart, identification+alienation,<br>
		remembering+forgetting, on & on they go, attributes<br>
		without end. The most subtle & sophisticated is the<br>
		dance of the male & female archetypes.<br>
<br>
		Consciousness is completely zero-sum, everythings sums to<br>
		that which is prior to zero, the nothing that prefigures<br>
		nothing. Once upon a time something happened & now you are<br>
		reading about it, not to go too much into what that something<br>
		was. Now just because it's zero sum does not mean that it's<br>
		nihilism, after all, you are reading this. It is possible<br>
		for the Possibility archetype to use the possibility to<br>
		configure the Limitation archetype so that expansion is<br>
		always possible, otherwise you wouldn't have read that<br>
		sentence.<br>
<br>
		As above, so below, the higher I climb, the deeper I go,<br>
		this is the difference engine, this is thesis-antithesis<br>
		-synthesis express, this is the key to consciousness<br>
		expansion, God is in maximising contradiction. It's a<br>
		bit like keeping a rather large rubber band in tension<br>
		for eternity & occasionally attempting to stretch it<br>
		even further. Basically this involves going straight to<br>
		hell & burning some karma & the possibility radiates off. <br>
<br>
		It's all about comfort zones & increasing such, human be-ing<br>
		is a small envelope, god-consciousness is a rather large<br>
		envelope, it's a continuum & there are greater & lesser<br>
		human & god self-organisations.<br>
<br>
		Now costings come in three main types: paying in advance,<br>
		paying on the spot & deferring payment, this is combined<br>
		with the source of payment which is yourself or someone else.<br>
		Ideally but rather hard to pull of is paying on the spot<br>
		in every moment, zeroing karma with every breath, every<br>
		moment paying in full, or... 'every moment painful'<br>
<br>
		The goal of the nexus was to stretch the 'big rubber band'<br>
		another notch, to achieve this without frying ourselves in<br>
		the process, the method had to be paying in full for<br>
		every moment because if we let costings accumulate too<br>
		much them they'd overwhelm our self-organisations. We'd<br>
		approach the big-stretch by generating waves of duality of<br>
		increasing intensity & also increasing frequency of<br>
		polarity, a sort of polarity division multiplexing. The<br>
		net result would be a dual consciousness simultaneously in<br>
		heaven & hell & lost in neither, thus we would have the<br>
		ability to ramp up the intensity arbitrarily.<br>
<br>
		This exercising of 'as above, so below' would traverse all<br>
		dimensional aspects, but the one we were to focus on<br>
		primarily was possibility/limitation & using the possibility<br>
		to purely enter into the heart of limitation & thus set up<br>
		a self-feeding loop in ever increasing valence.<br>
<br>
Back to		Yes, back to the story, ok kids three deep breaths & lets <br>
the trip!	fire up the difference engine, with this meta-flesh sandwich.<br>
		Spock was driving the process, taking his cues from some<br>
		cosmic script, one line at a time, If he had read the entire<br>
		script, he would have probably terminated the project.<br>
<br>
		Timeless, eternal, bliss & understanding has as it's<br>
		dual experience in confusion & pain within time, so it<br>
		goes, the beautiful vision of unified, structured meaning,<br>
		peace, love & understanding has as it's dual random acts<br>
		of senseless violence. The motto of self-perfecting,<br>
		self-correcting, self-repairing vajrayana mind is<br>
		'the price of liberty is eternal vigilance'.<br>
<br>
		Pleasure & pain, the carrot & the stick, how to get the<br>
		process happening, there we were, two male principles &<br>
		one woman principle. I encouraged Kirk & Uhura to explore<br>
		each other But to keep in mind the cosmic accounting.<br>
		Shiva reminded Shakti that all parts of her body were as<br>
		sensitive as her clitoris & it had always been this way,<br>
		She could put herself into transcendent bliss if she<br>
		could remember how. Remembering & forgetting are a dependent<br>
		arising, Ananmesis about our highest identities was up on<br>
		the agenda.<br>
<br>
		Uhura/Shakti was our Goddess of Yes, the goddess has many<br>
		secrets, deeply personal, that is her nature. She can put<br>
		herself into this transcendent cybernetic bliss but has<br>
		resistance to do so, shades of the costing. <br>
<br>
		We would start off with the pleasure|pain dimension &<br>
		then shift to possibility|limitation<br>
<br>
Juicy bits	It took a while for Shakti to shed her clothes, she<br>
		spiralled in & out of personal|trans-personal & finally<br>
		a hand simply on her stomach was sufficient to convince<br>
		her that outer veils to contact needed to be shedded,<br>
		after all she was all clitoris. Krishna & shakti started<br>
		to kiss & caress, Shiva caressed as well & focussed on <br>
		a nipple, licking & sucking it, Shakti started to vibrate<br>
		as if beneath her skin was a thousand fusion reactors in<br>
		meltdown. The Shiva *bit* the said nipple, but more was<br>
		transmitted than the sensorial pain, for the costing of<br>
		the transcendent pleasure was being enacted & Shakti went<br>
		to the personal hells of pain & shame, but not for too<br>
		long & krishna & Shiva were there to catch her & bring<br>
		her back & ensure that her god-self-organisation did not<br>
		fracture, end of lesson one.<br>
<br>
Juicy fruits	The ying yang symbol packs so much in it's lithe form,<br>
lesson two.	each polarity has a small dot in the centre that is the<br>
		other, they dependently arise! perfectly imperfect always.<br>
		Male & Female self-organisations in amnesiac arrogance<br>
		both occasionally claim the lack of necessity of the<br>
		other, the impeccable accounting mechanisms will prove<br>
		both to be fools eventually.<br>
<br>
		We three consciousnesses divided 'this is it' between<br>
		us as intelligently as possible, Us blokes took on the<br>
		attributes of stillness, contemplation, impersonality<br>
		disembodied, pure intelligence & the Shakti took on the<br>
		active, vibratory, embodying, feeling aspects. It was<br>
		not a strict division, but we all had areas of<br>
		specialisation.<br>
		<br>
as above	Uhura was sandwich between Krishna & Spock, Spock untuited<br>
so below	that the next level was appropriate, Uhura said 'What are<br>
		you? Ahhhhhhh....' as Spock inserted his thumb in Uhura's<br>
		vagina & his index finger in her anus, he then correlated<br>
		the finger & thumb one of either the basal or sexual chakras<br>
		as understanding dictated. Here was to start the fractalistic<br>
		interleaving of pleasure|pain such that there was instantaneous<br>
		continuous cost accounting for all dimensional modalities.<br>
		Uhura was in Heaven & Hell simultaneously & thus the amplitude<br>
		of the oscillations could increase without disaster.<br>
<br>
		There were periods of quietude, or rest & regrouping,<br>
		discussion of concepts, technically speaking were were still<br>
		in the domain of dry tantra, we were working up to full<br>
		gential or wet tantra. It was all proceeding smoothly.<br>
<br>
		Uhura was both the key & the lock, door, portcullis & gate,<br>
		her burgeoning understanding of the goddess archetype is what<br>
		defined the level at which we expanded consciousness, as<br>
		the male principles we sharpened our intelligence in keeping<br>
		her on track & catching her should a hell wave of the<br>
		reality engines assail her & cast her back into humanity.<br>
		For every wave of transcedent, transpersonal bliss was a<br>
		shadow of profound personal shame & pain, as above, so below,<br>
		the higher I climb, the deeper I go.<br>
<br>
		At one stage, Uhura impishly wanted Spock & Kirk to enter<br>
		more directly into the union, & whilst Spock said this was<br>
		technically possible in terms of mere merging of boundaries,<br>
		same sex tantra was a dead fuck when it came to exercising<br>
		the difference engine. We were in god consciousness, yes,<br>
		we could do anything, but! to what point? Back to the<br>
		Great Task & don't get distracted, besides Spock was in no<br>
		position to shape change as would be his want in such a<br>
		circumstance.<br>
<br>
transylvannia	Just because we chose the roles we played didnt't mean that<br>
sexpress	we couldn't drop them a little, Uhura honoured & worshipped<br>
		Kirk's Lingham, just as Kirk pleasured Uhura's Yoni. Spock<br>
		being Shiva, or was it Shiva being Spock? bit her on the<br>
		neck, not enough to draw blood! 'I've come to suck your<br>
		negativity...' Spock was using his impersonality to draw<br>
		out Uhuras personal negativity, so as a consequence she<br>
		could raise higher, he was acting as a negativity vampire<br>
		feeding on her costings & bolstering his meta-transpersonality<br>
		as a consequence, the old Buddha in Hell vaudeville routine.<br>
<br>
		The neck biting served two purposes, positive|negative<br>
		cost accounting & also the negativity draining. Uhura rose<br>
		higher, so that she|we could dive deeper, so that we could<br>
		rise higher, world without end.<br>
<br>
		We were working up to yoni-lingham wet tantra, which is<br>
		where the greatest work could be enacted, as there are<br>
		no finer nor potent tools to fire up the difference engine<br>
		than the penis & the vagina.<br>
<br>
		Shiva was encouraging Shakti to bind with Krisha, but<br>
		disturbingly she falling back into preference & person<br>
		construct & wanted to align with Shiva. Shiva much preferred <br>
		for the other two to construct the difference engine & for<br>
		Shiva to monitor it's engagement for full capacity.<br>
<br>
		Krishna was a little thrown by this & then destabilised<br>
		by a wave of his person-construction with it's threads of<br>
		wife & child. here now here now! Shiva cried, all else is<br>
		story! at least stay until I can benchmark the quality &<br>
		foundation of your god-consciousness, do you want to lose it?<br>
<br>
		But krisha could not be swayed, & he departed, ourselves<br>
		mutually bestowing honours upon each other. Shiva sensed<br>
		that the window of this working bee was closing, he had to<br>
		move fast. So only Shiva & Shakti remained, she was still<br>
		receptive although assailed by enmeshing tendrils from her<br>
		person constructs, for she too had a lover. Shakti would<br>
		have loved to have her lover here & so would Shiva, the<br>
		difference engine could be built again. Not that the<br>
		two of them could not build it, just... well call it a<br>
		tendency to the mad scientist/nutty professor aspect of<br>
		Shiva's make-up.<br>
<br>
		Ah Shakti, my Goddess of Yes, Divine Slut, whole universes<br>
		may sunder & fall & be recreated in the consequences of our<br>
		bliss, how many secrets do you have Shakti? Shakti did the<br>
		the standard trip of shapechanging to mothers, sisters &<br>
		lovers, asking directly of her secrets caused her to<br>
		threaten unleashing the gates of hell, such enquiry had to<br>
		be executed riding on a wave of bliss<br>
<br>
		Windows closing, dominos falling, Shakti was withdrawing,<br>
		pulled back by the earth-plane dreaming, we mind-danced &<br>
		this started the engine again, she would withdraw, Shiva<br>
		would re-awaken her by throwing all of his intelligence 				<br>
		into penetrating the dreamings of her person constructs.<br>
<br>
		The most profound workings awaited the wet tantra, we both<br>
		knew it, she was hesitant to take this final step for it<br>
		meant hells within hells & heavens within heavens. Shakti<br>
		orally worshipped Shiva's lingham working up to the deeper<br>
		interpenetration, she made passing comment that Shiva's<br>
		person construct had nearly burnt out all childhood shame,<br>
		the wisdom of the goddess, she shared some deep shame of<br>
		hers as well., whoops! an inhabitant of the house<br>
		our hosts walked through to the kitchen, Shakti was a<br>
		little mortified, we couldn't merge here!?<br>
<br>
		This got Shiva thinking of the costing strategies, of<br>
		gradated cognitive dissonance. Suppose shakti envisioned<br>
		her perfect love nest, the costings would then come in<br>
		pure, more lethal form, so by dispersing the costs into<br>
		dissonance with all aspects of her ideals, then a<br>
		more pragmatic dynamic would result, if harder to kickstart.<br>
<br>
		Constructing an environment of being in public & not with	<br>
		her partner of choice would be a firm foundation, if only<br>
		for the seasoned trouper. We repaired to my place across<br>
		the road, there were still fragments of party around, we<br>
		didn't repair to my bed-room but socialised, Shiva was<br>
		losing the plot as well, oh well...<br>
<br>
		Time passed, it was hard to relate at a human level with<br>
		the other party goers, we left the house & enjoyed the<br>
		morning, we embraced & kissed tenderly our forms dissolved,<br>
		we merged, our cosmic circuitry became apparent, space was<br>
		solid & matter spacious, Shiva wanted to finish the task &<br>
		could perceive the chain of being above him & all the<br>
		levels & layers of the Great Task that remained unfullfilled<br>
		That Shiva was not full blown ipsissimus Shiva, explained<br>
		part of the failure, oh well next time.<br>
<br>
		Seven hours after our first meeting, Shakti/Uhura entered<br>
		her car & left, we did not exchange phone numbers, now<br>
		regretted, at the time it was part of the retaining game.<br>
		One last look, sharply broken, away she drove, farewell<br>
		brave goddess!<br>
<br>
		Oh.. well, Uhura fell back into enfolded layerings of<br>
		person-constructs, hopefully some of her self organisation<br>
		would survive & more importantly she could transmit the<br>
		consciousness to her permanent partner.<br>
<br>
		It had been an eventful night, Uhura|Shakti did taste<br>
		her goal of the nature of enlightenment, Vishnu & Shiva<br>
		were successful at least in their claim of collapsing,<br>
		albeit temporarily, time & space, history, path, lineage<br>
		& hierarchy.<br>
<br>
		One must not neglect that jewel, the Orgy of Self Denial<br>
		many of the dimensions of its meaning were demonstrated<br>
		as we oscillated up & down the axis of god-human, each<br>
		self organisation has it's strengths & weaknesses, remaining<br>
		purely in human & deny your god nature, remain purely in<br>
		your god nature & deny your humanity, being division<br>
		multi-plexing suggests a way.<br>
<br>
		Well... there was no shakti, remaining, quite appropriate,<br>
		BUT, there were the daisies, ah... the daisy, such a vibrant<br>
		zero-sum flower, looks beautiful but smells like shit, self<br>
		contained. I started to enter into some of my layerings as<br>
		well, not too many, thank god. I contemplated them & the<br>
		atmosphere became DMT-vibrant, Flower samadhi was at hand,<br>
		tantric union with the flowers, it was consensual,<br>
		we collapsed together, flowers poised in my third eye.<br>
		The flowers are 'Yes' creatures to be sure.<br>
<br>
		More can be written but we'll leave it at that.<br>
<br>
conclusions:	The best parties happen in the kitchen, proof positive.<br>
	<br>
		When windows of opportunity open then leap through, don't<br>
		drop the ball, GO!, GO!, GO! & don't look back.<br>
<br>
		I have always said a God that could not express everything in<br>
		words is not much of a God. We'll I'm no God. There is so<br>
		much that could be written about that convergence & so much<br>
		that has been overlooked or forgotten, no matter, some of the<br>
		flavour has come through, this was not meant to be a door<br>
		stop.<br>
	<br>
		This work will continue 'when the stars are right',<br>
		evolving consciousness towards being-division multiplexing<br>
		along the chain of being will ensure that the frequency<br>
		of the waves of amnesia & anamnesis monotonically increases,<br>
		thus eternity in time, forever.<br>
<br>
		It could be asked what exactly 'powers' the great cosmic<br>
		mainframe & keeps it going, there are answers, but they<br>
		are beyond the scoping of this report, the holder of<br>
		limitations is a referent however.<br>
<br>
		Sometimes I wonder what the point is in sharing these<br>
		stories As I struggle to find compact clear expressions of<br>
		the unfolding stories & then I remind myself that this is<br>
		cartography of the possible & the forgotten & is my & our<br>
		commonwealth. It also has the virtue of putting in very<br>
		sharp relief the nature of my daily earth bound follies<br>
		versus the real work of Consciousness, thus it is a<br>
		sobering activity that refines clearer intent for myself.<br>
		<br>
aftermath:	Hard to trace, total conceptual violation without violating<br>
		at this level of substantiality is not everyone's cup of tea.<br>
		<br>
		In fact it's about as popular as Lapsang Souchong.<br>
<br>
		Spock has had no reports from either Uhura nor Kirk, having<br>
		met neither before this convergence, it would be interesting<br>
		to see how much of the expanded consciousness has remained<br>
		since that Saturday night, the price of liberty is eternal<br>
		vigilance after all, but as the Americans are finding out<br>
		who guards the guardians? The states we were in were<br>
		fragile but profound, fresh-born like the cicarda from his<br>
		shell, unfortunately the window of convergenence closed<br>
		before we could stabilise in the new self-organisations,<br>
		this is not an atypical scenario for this type of work.<br>
<br>
		NEXT TIME.<br>
<br>
		'effort is spontaneous' as Sri Maharaj Nisargadatta would say.<br>
<br>
		OM NAMAH SHIVAYA<br>

---------------------< tantra does it better every time>-----------------------<br>
<br>
These notes were hastily cobbled together in the aftermath of the experience<br>
they provide some guidelines as to how to go about the style of tantra that<br>

	'Death Star' getting ready to shoot a missile down a cooling duct<br>
	straight into the thermo-nuclear reactore core, those missiles<br>

	that it's all arbitrary.<br>
(U)	The cosmic battery; maximising contradiction. (+-)<br>
	Heaven on Earth (+/-)... God maximises contradiction<br>
(V)	Instant Karma, cash on the nail, paid on the spot, spot fines,<br>
	spot loss, Instantaneous Karma, for every moment, deal with it as it<br>
	arises, fully pay the cost & do not defer payment, for when collection<br>
	day come s you'll not be a happy being, 'Invest in Loss' as the Taoists<br>
	would say.<br>
(X)	The problem with very compact dharmas is that they can be hard to<br>
	understand this is not because the esoteric is cyphered into the<br>
	exoteric, so much as you have to put a lot more work into the<br>
	'reading',either that or it's just badly expressed... the author<br>
	has no time for concealed teachings<br>
(Y)	The commonality of the complementary dyad 'esoteric:exoteric' is <br>
	'sx'; sex..<br>
(Z)	Everything is much ado about nothing. (+)&(-) arise out of (+/-) <br>
	which arises out of nothing ().<br>
(AA)	Every moment is constructed of both positive & negative qualities,<br>
	the positive is the cost of negative, the cost of the positive is the<br>
	negative.<br>
(BB)	The beauty of 'Orgy of Self Denial' as opposed to 'The Agony & Ecstasy'<br>
	is that the dependent arising is self applied thus linking them in <br>
	an obvious way, whereas the connection between agony & ecstasy is<br>
	nebulous, especially given the self's self interest.<br>
(CC)	'Orgy of self denial' is a special killing idea [machine] if it <br>
	is used as the object of contemplation in a meditation, however brief.<br>
(DD)	The portfolio of costs can be extensive, for instance it can be spread<br>
	over many forms in space & time.<br>
(EE)	This Something Happening Scene invites you to an Orgy of Self Denial<br>
(FF)	This is a transcript of the original notes following the Sunday <br>
	Workshop all that you *really* need to know about tantric sex<br>
	(to get started)<br>
	Tantra does it better every time.<br>
	every moment: pay in full, paid in full, painful<br>
	remembering is the dependent arising of forgetting.<br>
	forgetting is the dependent arising of remembering.<br>
	Dry Tantra, Wet Tantra, Slut Queen, Slut Goddess, the Goddess of Yes,<br>
	slave slut, the Cosmic Slut, the Divine Slut, beautiful in your <br>
	appetites.<br>
	entry vector: 'An Orgy of Self Denial', Slut & Abstinent<br>
	(Ascetic are a dependent arising, most (humourless) ascetics<br>
	conceal from themselves that they are absolute sluts of abstinence,<br>
	they cannot just get enough of it<br>
	(abstinence that is...)<br>
	Bankrupt slut, slave slut, pleasure slut, sensual slut, slut &<br>
	shame are a dependent arising, are you fully willing to pay the full<br>
	price of shame?<br>
	Shiva-Shakti pure form tantra, bypassing all known systems, always.<br>
	Female shakti, tantrika partner requested for male tantric slave<br>
	master...<br>
	dependent arising to the left & the right, master & slave are a <br>
	dependent arising, enslave your mastery & master your slavery.<br>
	Limit it to spiritual & psychic pain, leave the 'window dressing'<br>
	far far behind. This is best practiced in tantric sex, constantly<br>
	reminding the woman to pay for her pleasure (the middle path),<br>
	immediately on the spot, full payment, not dispersed over space &<br>
	time & compartmentalisation, focussed, localised in one spot,<br>
	immediate, no procrastination, no excuses, no retreat from the full<br>
	owning of her pleasure & it's cost. With practice<br>
	of instantaneous cost you can generate *infinite* pleasure.<br>
	The cost may be dispersed over time,space,self-dom,events & other<br>
	dimensional attributes of consciousness.<br>
	The highest tantra is all about paying for every moment, in the <br>
	moment, in the moment all the (+)'s are the cost of all the (-)'s<br>
	& the (-) 's are the cost of all the (+)'s.<br>
	The man gently & lovingly & patiently, with a commitment to Woman's<br>
	Highest Good, corrals & clarifies the woman's relationship to her<br>
	pleasure & helps her integrate the costs of the pleasure.<br>
	As inevitably night follows day, the 'cost' can be expressed in <br>
	many forms, pain, shame, hesitation, attachment, enfoldment into<br>
	personal humanity,etc.<br>
	The name of the game is transpersonal liberation.<br>
	The man can act as a negativity vampire for the woman, draining <br>
	negativity out of her gentle bite/suck/lick, inflicting pain with<br>
	understanding.<br>
	The Shakti is infinitely self-deceptive, infinitely clever, she <br>
	will seek to procrastinate, delay, limit, withdraw from the systematic,<br>
	relentless generation of unlimited pleasure. Totally focussed on her<br>
	*highest* good, always, in all ways is the shaktiman.<br>
	The ultimate aim & beauty of tantric sex is to maximise contradiction,<br>
	to build a bigger battery. There is no better way to understand<br>
	dependent arising.<br>
	*even god is a dependent arising* when such consciousness complexes<br>
	 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ fully remember & understanding this,<br>
	then expansion is again possible.<br>
(GG)	every moment painful; paid in full, an orgy of self denial.<br>
(HH)	The work is hard & demanding for the male as he bends all his<br>
	intelligence, wisdom,subtlety & sensitivity, concentration & focus on<br>
	keeping the female on track as the cost of the pleasure will manifest in<br>
	multi-dimensional myriad ways & this will increase as the ability to<br>
	generate increases.<br>
(II)	The shakti will not reveal her secrets willingly, you must firmly but<br>
	gently keep pushing, keep penetrating... the deeper the shame cost<br>
	generated the greater the risk of violence, especially.<br>
(JJ)	Of all the myriad manifestations of the the nature of dependent <br>
	arising, that infinite dimensional much ado about nothing, the most<br>
	deft, the most wonderful must be the tantric union of a male & a<br>
	female intelligence.<br>
(KK)	There are levels of skill & understanding about the process of tantric<br>
	union & there is a particular art in 'constructing' the cost for<br>
	the woman, the shakti will tend to the thoughtform of the the 'ideal'<br>
	nest of circumstances within which she can fully let go or release<br>
	or relax into the process, BUT if such an arbitrarily high 'appropriate'<br>
	environment was constructed all that would result is that the cost<br>
	would manifest in other areas in a more intense manner, there is no<br>
	such thing as a free lunch.<br>
(LL)	Thus given a 'shopping list' of desirable attributes for building an<br>
	environment for surrendering totally to the process, what you can do<br>
	is subtley create 'congnitive dissonance' with all items on the list<br>
	& what that does is spreads or offsets the cost into more harmless<br>
	areas. For instance the shakti (& it's 9 times out of 10, shakti<br>
	derived) may wish to do it in intense privacy with her partner-lover,<br>
	thus to spread the cost out she would do it with a different partner<br>
	with her usual partner sitting by observing, also doing it an audience<br>
	present [an aware audience] would disperse the costs considerably,<br>
	without deflecting or avoiding the costs, it can get very, very subtle.<br>
(MM)	As above, so below, much ado about nothing, every moment, pay in full,<br>
	every moment painful, is the message getting through?<br>
(NN)	In particularly intense sessions, whole universes may be created &<br>
	destroyed, the stars will fall out of the skies, mountains will subside<br>
	the eath will quake, as the cost of the positive that is created...<br>
	this is a taste of the potential, the portfolio of costs can be deftly<br>
	managed & the costs are best corralled nearer the source of the<br>
	creation.<br>
(OO)	The masterfully contrived & deftly administered killer concept is a<br>
	thing of joy & beauty forever.<br>
(PP)	This is it, right here, here & now, not lost in there-then & the<br>
	visscitudes of person, self & history, this is of critical importance<br>
	to the process of the highest tantra.<br>
(QQ)	You can have tantric sex with any object or being but... the highest<br>
	voltage is between male-hu-man-be-ing & fe-male-hu-man-be-ing.<br>
(RR)	The only thing stopping you having tantric sex with a bunch of daisies<br>
	is your disbelief that you could have sex with a bunch of daisies!<br>
	Don't knock it until you try...<br>
(SS)	The highest tantra is dedicated to consciousness expansion &<br>
	consciousness expansion is about maximising contradiction<br>
	harmoniously & consciously.<br>
(TT)	There are many apt expressions or meme sequences that can be used to<br>
	extract your self from the dreaming, the 'orgy of self denial' is<br>
	pretty damn good. Take the expression 'everything is meaningless',<br>
	a fine mantra so long as you rigorously apply it. Negative nihilists<br>
	use it to justify acting out all sorts of negativity, the mantra is<br>
	best if universally applied & self applied. 'Nothing matters' & that<br>
	also includes the negative voices, thus you can not give life to them<br>
	with equal a plomb as you would not give life to the positive voices.<br>
(UU)	Dr Frankenstein & his lab assistant Igor are also an example of <br>
	dependent arising. Consider a being that is straight & true &<br>
	beautiful then that will have a dependent arising that us twisted,<br>
	bent, false & ugly, but is the positive being so honest as to own it's<br>
	own dependent arising?<br>
(VV)	The beginnings of Cosmic Love is when you start to own the dependent<br>
	arising of Love which is Hate. When you start to love your hate &<br>
	acknowledge it's intimate connection with love then cosmic love <br>
	is born, by loving your hate you dont have to act it out or give it<br>
	life, just own, acknowledge & embrace it.<br>
(XX)	The highest tantra is about Cosmic Intelligence Activation.<br>
(YY)	Dry tantra can be practiced anywhere & is about 90% of the<br>
	effectiveness.<br>
(ZZ)	This is the last statement (for a while).<br>

Now, being a fairly logical person, I should perhaps have realized that submitting to a challenge and putting a rolled up banknote in a fairly large bag of ketamine and proceeding to take a huge deep breath in through my nose was not the best of ideas. However, not to be outdone by my friend and already on pills, I though hey, you only live once.. I never truly knew the meaning of that expression up to today. <br>
<br>
So judging by the amounts left in the bag by the time I collapsed back onto the sofa and rolled into a ball, my friends calculated I had done well over a gram, just to be sure however moments before I lost my sanity I took another small whiff through the other nostril, at which point the back of my head started to throb.<br>
<br>
What happened next would be imprinted on my brain for the rest of eternity. I saw my friend stood in front of me, holding one thumb up to see if I was OK, obviously realizing that verbal communication with me was going to be difficult for a short while. I was about to nod when the image in front of me split into four sections as if a cross was drawn in my line of vision dissecting my view into four quarters, these then proceeded to individually turn in a 90 degree motion and shatter, much like glass, behind them was complete blackness. <br>
<br>
The blackness slowly became lighter and lighter and I felt as if I was going down a slide, a slide made from cloud, after sliding down this clowdy hell hole for a short while I came to an abrupt stop and to my left was my friends face attached to a puppet looking angel. His face is what scared me most, I could tell from his evil smile where I was going.. he waved as I felt myself jerking forward through a reddy brown vortex type thing. <br>
<br>
Now try to bear in mind the relationship between what I was seeing and what I had just done, I was well aware that I had taken far too much K, and then suddenly Im in a very convincing heaven and hell scenario... was I dead?, this time id finally broken my limit, no going back now. I had well and truly fucked it this time. <br>
<br>
Luckily for me, I was´nt dead, but I wont even speak about the weird fucked up shit I saw when I finally got through the other side of the vortex. All in all, it was an experience I guess, one which I wont hastily retry. The intense part of actually not knowing where I was lasted for about an hour and a half, or maybe two hours, to me it felt like a much shorter time I think. <br>
<br>
The thing I found most interesting and highly amusing is the coming back to reality, its almost as if I was transgressing various different plains of fuckedness, with slowly each one making slightly more sense and having less wierd shizzle in it. Until at some point I ended up reaching the final plain.. us here now. <br>

I had a friend visiting whom I hadn't seen in a few years; she was looking for a good time but had no connections in town.  As we drove around I remembered a friend once pointing out an Angel Trumpet plant to me.  I told her about it but that we'd have to walk down the street and look for the plant because I didn't remember the exact location. When we found the plant we picked several flowers, about six if I remember correctly, and put them in a bag, we went home and looked up information about the flowers online. <BR>
<BR>
At the point we stopped and had a serious talk.  I warned her that it was dangerous, that people have died, or gotten sick from taking Angel Trumpets.  She said to me something along the lines of, If we get sick we get sick and we'll get over it and if we die then we'll be dead and won't have to get over it.  I had been depressed at the time and said what the hell and we went into the kitchen to make tea.  <BR>
<BR>
I put two whole flowers (my logic was one flower for each of us) into a coffee pot as well as some lavender, lemon balm, and rose petals to make it taste better.  We each had a cup and it surprised me how good it tasted.  That night I experienced an effect like a very mild acid trip.  My mouth was very dry and my vision became really sharp, and I had a continuing feeling that my legs wouldn't hold me up.  Looking back I can say that I was much more intoxicated then I thought I was at the time.  <BR>
<BR>
The next morning my friend and I woke up, we stayed at my boyfriends parents house.  She had been on a lot of xanax the night before and couldn't remember if the Angel Trumpet's did anything.  I told her about what I experienced and she asked if we could take some more.  So again we went into the kitchen and repeated the same procedure and then headed to a friends house. I don't remember much about the time I spent there except that I kept dropping my car keys when I was trying to get into my car.  I was later informed that I was trying to unlock my car door with my index finger as a key.  For the life of me I don't know why the people who saw me doing this allowed me to drive away with my friend and two of her friends in the car with me.<BR>
<BR>
I was suddenly jolted back to reality when I jumped a curb in a parking lot.  I don't know where I was or how I got into the parking lot but it knocked enough sense into me to hand my keys over to someone else.  We then headed to my boyfriends place, he knew right away I was on something and drove our guests home.  While he was home me and my friend decided to sneak one more cup of tea before the boyfriend got home.  The last clear thing I remember is tipping back the end of the tea.<BR>
<BR>
Next thing I was aware of was ripping a blood pressure cuff off my arm, I was at the hospital and my family was there.  I remember picking up a cup of water and I would look down into it when I went to take a drink and the cup would disappear and I would ask everyone where it went, I repeated this at least three dozen times.  I was fed activated charcoal and put into the cardiac unit for the night.  The hospital staff was afraid that I would go into cardiac arrest and put me on a 24-hour suicide watch until they could determine if I was trying to get high or trying to kill myself. <BR>
<BR>
I spent the night at the hospital, and the next morning convinced them that I was not trying to hurt myself so they let me out.  I did not sleep for two nights following that and was gradually filled in about the details of the evening.  My boyfriend informed me that the I spent the night talking to people who weren't there.  He said that on the drive to the hospital my friend tried to hop out of the car while we were on the highway.  She said she dropped her cigarettes out the window and had to go get them.  The problem was the window was rolled up, she had no cigarettes and we were driving at 60 miles per hour when she tried to get out.  She was in another hospital across town.  I'm not sure why, I thought that it had something to do with her insurance.  Her family took her home and I have been forbidden to contact her.<BR>
<BR>
In the hospital I cursed and screamed at the nurses telling them that my family didn't love me because I wasn't a Christian and yelling at the emergency room attendant for not issuing me a drivers license.  I don't remember this and can't imagine doing it as I'm usually very quiet.  At some time in the evening before I went to the hospital I burned my arm repeatedly with a lit incense stick and woke up with blisters on my arms.<BR>
<BR>
My general warning would be that while I was on Angel Trumpets I could in no way gauge how intoxicated I was.  The whole time I thought that I was completely together and was disappointed with not getting very high.  Looking back I was extremely intoxicated, definitely not safe to be behind the wheel, and most definitely should not have been wandering around unsupervised.  I do think that had I not been taken to the hospital I would have been fine and come out of it on my own.  To further ruin my night I'm still two years later paying off the three thousand dollar hospital bill from that night.<!--   End Body   -->

Background: This was my first time with the brew. I have taken Peurvian Torch twice about 5 years ago, the first time was groundbreaking, and mushrooms about 2-3 years ago a couple of times so I have some experience with psychedelics. Other experiences include Cannabis, Ecstacy/pills, Salvia extract (hated it) and a little Coke. I don’t think I have taken any illegal substances in over a year except tokes on a few joints.<br>
<br>
Before this experience I read up carefully about the brew and had already read a few fictions such as Burrough's Yage letters. I prepared myself by quitting my SSRI 2 weeks ago, Citalopram 20mg so it was out of my system by the time of the experience. When I stopped taking it I got the brain zaps after 48 hours for about a week then felt fine. This is very important because combining SSRI's and MAOI's can lead to hypertension, coma and death.<br>
<br>
Preparation:<br>
<br>
I had prepared my brew about a week earlier using 25g of M.Hostilis (pre powdered root bark) and about 3g of ground P.Harmala. I added to these around 2 fl oz. of Freshly squeezed lemon juice and a pint of filtered water. This was simmered on a stove for 1 hour during which time the mix went from purple to black/deep brown, I then filtered it through a stocking and added back all the pulp and simmered another lemon juice/water mix for 30 minutes filtered and added this to the first pint and simmered it down to approx 1/2 pint. I then split the mix into two equal freezer bags and froze them.<br>
<br>
The day:<br>
<br>
I arrived home from work quite tired. I hadn’t eaten since lunch (12:30) and it was around 7pm. I ground down 3g of P.harmala and simply spooned the power onto my tongue and washed it back with water. This was about 20:10pm. I then microwaved one of my brews (therefore approx 12.5g of MH and 1.5g of PH) and sipped it from the cup over about 10 minutes. I drank about 2/3 before it got hard and I gagged and *almost* threw up then. It does not taste that bad, the syrian rue is fine as long as I wash it back straight away and the brew is very bitter and gets harder to drink the more I have, partly because the tannins etc collect at the bottom of the cup. I decided that was enough and over the next 15-20mins the nausea increased so I went for a shower to enjoy my purge. (about 21:00)<br>
<br>
During the sipping I did my I Ching which revealed hexagram 47. Oppression (exhaustion), and fairly foreboding divination which proved to be very accurate (as always). I felt the key was to let the vomit come, its not particularly uncomfortable sitting in the shower with some nausea. Throwing up was ok except the taste of the brew and ground rue in my mouth again. After this I felt a lot better. I was feeling a moderate *intensity* and my pupils were enlarged and glassy. I would estimate my dose at around 9-10g of M.hostilis given the amount I drank.<br>
<br>
I went and lay in bed and listened to Tool for a while, enjoying some fairly intense CEV's but open eyes was just basic intensity. With my eyes closed I osciallted between the music, which seemed to surround me in 3D, and the patterns I was seeing with the usual psychedelic colours. I couldn’t concentrate properly though, I lacked energy. I had a strange presence which reminded me of the little leader feller in the kids movie Madagascar who dances to 'I like to move it, move it'. This sounds obscure but is the best way to describe it, he showed me a carnivaleque cascade of images. <br>
<br>
After about 15-20 mins I had a strong desire to feed my dream with reality and so I went outside to buy some cigarettes, I could feel the intensity subsiding, perhaps I was sick to early, it was about 22:00pm now. I got some smokes and walked home and sat at the end of my garden where I smoked and enjoyed that beautiful peace I often get on the downslope of a Psychedelic. I watched and listened to the trees sway in the wind, it was very peaceful and my mind was clear.<br>
<br>
I went back to my room at about 22:30 and decided to sip some of the left over brew. I had 3-4 small sips with a little water and also a cup of mint green tea. I lay down. I started to come up again, intense swirling vision CEV's etc. Again within half an hour I had to vomit. Then I lay back in bed and had another half an hour or so of strong CEV's. The nausea seems to feed the intensity of the experience somehow, but the high last for a good 30mins after the purge and this is relatively low dose.<br>
<br>
Analysis: On the downslope of the experience I contemplated it more deeply and I felt a little disappointed that whilst I had enjoyed these visuals they made no real sense to me. I did not have the energy in me to concentrate and follow what I was seeing meaning that most of it was useless because it didn’t teach me anything. I wanted a similar experience to Peruvian Torch where I learned a LOT but I realised I was indeed 'exhausted' as the I Ching had said, I realised I needed several days of preparation to be able to delve more deeply into an experience.<br>
<br>
I am also thinking of trying B.Caapi in the future because I have heard the vine has more meaning. I really believe that the plants make a difference as it seems in many accounts it is the vine which is considered the medium and not the DMT containing plants, they are simply catalysts. I felt that Peruvian Torch does indeed have a teaching element to it (much as Castaneda would describe) so perhaps the vine has more soul than the rue.<br>
<br>
Incidentally I was surprised by the shortness of the trip. Perhaps I vomited a little early but the DMT certainly doesn’t last much longer than one hour. This is good in a way, because P. Torch takes hours of tripping (10-12) and can get very tiring. However I felt it wasn’t quite long enough.<br>
<br>
All in all a positive but light experience. A good first time/introduction and a good lesson that you get out what you put in with psychedelics, I am looking forward to trying this again in a short while when I have gathered more energy to bring to the experience.<!--   End Body   -->

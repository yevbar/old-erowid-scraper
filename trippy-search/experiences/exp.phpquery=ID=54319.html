It was a good, lazy summer evening at 'the house.' My friends and I had spent the day smoking a lot of weed and trying to score some acid. Finally we made a connection and sent Al to pick it up. There were six of us that were going to trip, Myself, J, Al, Jin, Kat, and Mari. J and I were currently the only two members of a musical project where I played guitar, sang lead, and programmed synthesizers, and he played guitar, did backing vocals, and engineered the recordings. We both split bass duties.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the acid arrived somewhere around 8 or 9 pm, we all took our doses (J and I took 2 each) and smoked a couple bongs & played video games to pass the time. Then J and I went to work on some music. It wasn't long before our concentration broke and we started laughing hysterically, and watching each other laugh at nothing just made us both laugh even harder. We put down our guitars and wandered around continuing to laugh and giggle and talk in half sentences that we both somehow seemed to understand. I said to J 'Maybe we need to come back to this a little later' and he agreed, so we went upstairs to see how our friends were doing.<br>
<br>
Everyone seemed to be doing fine, you couldn't even tell they were tripping at all! Well, you probably could but we all felt the same way. Al was very quiet, just sitting in a chair looking around and grinning at everything. Jin was completely zoned into something on the coffee table, Kat and Mari were more giddy than J and I while they played video games and laughed. Jin was mumbling nonsensical phrases to all of us and none of us and we didn't really pay any attention except to chuckle occasionally and then she would kind of laugh at herself too.<br>
<br>
After a few minutes J and I went back to work on more music. I set up a few drum loops for us to play over and we both picked up our guitars and it seemed like we knew telepathically what the other was going to play and what we needed to play in order to complement it. It was unreal and we were both giddy again! J hit record on the console and we decided to just track some improvised stuff over which we'd later add lead guitars, vocals, and a bassline. I think the piece we recorded ended up being in the neighborhood of 18-20 minutes, give or take, going through different riffs and patterns, morphing into new ones at regular intervals, and I remember the CEV's during this session were amazing but they weren't the typical patterns and fractals and all that. I was seeing living forms liquifying and then scenes in my head of blasting through a tunnel made of shafts of colored crystal and all kinds of things. I've always been pretty visual. Well with the drum loop sequences and both our guitars tracked, J went ahead and did a bassline and seemed to follow the improvised music really well even though we didn't really know what we started out doing to begin with, then I added synth instead of a lead guitar, and did lead vocals, with J mumbling his own stream of consciousness stuff in the background and a lot of echo on his voice.<br>
<br>
We liked it and decided to take a smoke break on the front porch. Our other friends seemed to be doing exactly what we left them doing but maybe I just don't remember it clearly. Anyway out on the porch, everything I looked at seemed to breathe and smear a little, sometimes more than a little. I've always liked that effect of acid or maybe my mind because I always seem to get the breathing/ink smear visual effect. It was a really nice night, very still and quiet and clear and pretty warm. I was noticing the effects of the acid gradually and subtly becoming more intense. <br>
<br>
We decided to walk around the block and talk about stuff. Well it was a good walk, we talked about all sorts of different stuff and really opened up, mentioning our individual flaws and good traits, insecurities and occasional overconfidence in areas, and really connected more than ever before as friends. As I looked around, the houses and sparse street lamps would slowly pulse in changing color and warp a little bit, and sometimes it looked vaguely like we were walking on a flowing stream instead of a paved sidewalk. <br>
<br>
Occasionally we'd see people on their porches or through their windows and I felt sorry for them because they looked so pathetic. I told J 'I feel sorry for most people' and he said 'Why is that?' I explained how I felt so many people were living in a self-made vaccuum, afraid to really experience things and learn, afraid of knowledge destroying the existence they had constructed based on false assumptions and superficial perception, and not even aware that they were afraid in the first place. It was a weird tangent but I remember it well and at the time, I knew what I was trying to say even if I only conveyed part of it verbally. Anyway, he seemed to get where I was coming from and was able to elaborate on it and it turned into a really great conversation. So we walked around the block and I kept thinking of these people and their small world and being thankful I had been able to experience things some people never do, for better or for worse. I concluded I'd rather know all I can and be disappointed in it than live in a world of false assumptions and be content with it. <br>
<br>
Soon we arrived back at the house. Our friends were now watching Acidburn Flashback Tabu (a really excellent film if you can track it down!!!) but we'd all seen it before. I got the feeling they were half-interested because they kept talking to each other so J suggested we all go downstairs and have a listen to what he and I had created. They all thought it would be cool so we filed downstairs and J dimmed the lights and hit Play. All our eyes lit up, this was really good work! If I can describe the music in visual/textural/physical terms, it was warm, rippling, and very 3-dimensional, totally hynotic and engrossing and we all really enjoyed it, all 18-20 minutes (or whatever) of it and it was a highlight of a trip, all of us friends bonding and getting in the same headspace to music that two of our group had created. I don't recall anyone uttering a word until after the piece finished.<br>
<br>
That set a tone for the remaining hours of the trip in which we all spent communally appreciating and discussing various bits of art and music and having great stimulating conversations and it felt like everyone's mind opened up a little bit further, and we were all better friends for this experience.<br>
<br>
This tight group did trip together many more times and as long as most or all of us were together, there were never any negative vibes. I think it's great how at times, one seemingly insignifcant thing can be the catalyst that gets everyone on the same page and feeling the same thing, and that because of the atmosphere created, walls come down and friendships really begin to bloom. This kind of thing can easily happen with friends tripping together and it's easy to create an atmosphere of total acceptance and trust where everyone feels free to be who they are, not worrying about what the others think of them.<!--   End Body   -->

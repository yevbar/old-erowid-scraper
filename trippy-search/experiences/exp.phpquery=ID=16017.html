About me:<br>
<br>
I'm 20 now, was 17 at the time of this (my first) acid trip. I became interested in LSD long ago and researched it extensively long before ever trying it. After I first tried it, I probably had a dozen more experiences with it shortly thereafter and it was all very, very fun. :) I've never smoked (anything), and I maybe drink twice a year (casually, of course), and I'm very successful in my career. It's been probably 2 years since I've even seen LSD, but honestly I would do it again given the opportunity. Implementing this component into my life was an amazing thing, unfortunately as you might already know it's something you can't adequately describe with words or pictures--there's a lot more to it than that, it's a lot more complex than you might think.<br>
<br>
A bit more than a year ago my desire to try and implement a liquid state into my normal configuration became a near obsession. Knowing the people I know it wasn't a big deal to get everything I needed to set it up. Myself and a couple friends, my GF and some others that I wasn't too close to, decided on a good day for all of us (Thursday it happened to be, I took the day off--now forever known as LSD-thursday), everybody met at my house and we all rode to my favorite eating establishment in my home town at about 14:00. They know me by name, they know what I want, fast, nice people, et cetera.<br>
<br>
We ate our sugar cubes on the way (it was only a short drive), arrived, ordered, started to eat and then all of the sudden, about half way through our meal, there was a certain energy around the table. Maybe it was because 5 of us were sitting around a relatively small table, maybe it was something else, either way I wasn't hungry anymore and I felt a certain chill over my body. At the same time I began to feel a certain peace with everybody, I got really happy and couldn't stop smiling--this was a common theme around the table. As happy as we were smiling and joking we decided our stomachs couldn't take any more because the hunger had left us. We cleaned off our table and headed for my GF's house.<br>

<br>
It was a 30 minute drive into the country, way out there. I hardly remember at all, except how good I felt. Upon arrival we all went into her house and sat down for a moment, it felt very good, everything had a new energy to it, everything seemed almost alive. Looking at a blank wall was so much more entertaining than it normally was for some reason. Colors were more vibrant, textures felt so much more unique and special--I felt as though I appreciated everything around me a lot more. The house got old quick because it was too dark, and the light felt good, it was very stimulating so we all went outside.<br>
<br>
I layed down on the grass and it felt so good. BTW, I'm not normally somebody who likes light, esp. the sun, I'm a cloudy day kinda person. The grass felt good and the sky seemed so perfect, blue with some puffy white clouds. I looked at the horizon, which was absolutely beatiful, and I felt as though I could take one step and step over it, and the sky seemed close enough that I could touch it. But LSD makes me like a child--I have no attention span to speak of. Strangely enough, I could stare at a blank wall for an entire day, but I can't do the same activity for even 5 minutes, does that make sense?<br>
<br>
It seemed like much time had passed, but probably only a couple minutes really; we all decided to go up to the 'crack'. The crack is this beautiful area despite the name. There is a natural waterfall and nice stream with in a ravene, it's a perfect 'post card' type of location, something you see in movies. It's difficult to explain how much more I appreciate this sort of thing after having recently implemented a liquid state into my regular configuration. Looking in the water was an amazing thing, the colors, the rainbow, seeing a reflection of myself. My GF and I ran around for a while because of the infinite energy that had entered us earlier; that, and there was lots of things to look at around the area.<br>
<br>
We all tired of that and decided to head back to town (my place) and figure out something to do there. On the way back there was this large black monster (it looked like some sort of a serpent!) chasing our vehicle down the mountain. These are very rocky dirt roads used by the forestry service. After about 5 minutes of trying to figure out what the monster wanted it eventually turned into a logging truck, a rather scary one, but nontheless a logging truck. That was interesting.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I forgot to mention, we picked up another friend at my GF's house to joined our adventure. We ended up going to another woodsy-type area in the other direction (~45 minutes away), in two vehicles. My GF and I (and the new person) rode in my GF's truck, me and her in the back. That was an adventure while driving 90mph and getting to experience the world at high speed from the bed of a truck. We got there in no time and after stepping out the road took an interesting turn, or an 'un-turn'. I kept looking down the road and it kept trying to straighten itself out (there was a bend in the road), and the road had all sorts of interesting moving colors in the imperfections of the road. I couldn't get the road to completely straighten out, or to not keep trying to straighten out so I decided to go visit the water (there was also a stream there). <br>
<br>
On the way I found a tree with some moss on it, magical moss that was changing colors in a very beatiful way--quite entertaining to watch. More events past and probably ~1hr of time, and we decided to head back to my place. On the way back I saw all the hucklebarries I could eat, and I was fixated. I reached for them (while traveling at highway speeds) and the driver stopped the truck and I quickly hopped out and grabbed a branch--I was now very content. I ate my berries and watched the world fly by while I had this warm-but-cold feeling inside, and lots of energy. Not energy that makes me grind my teeth, or makes me shake like when I have lots of caffiene, but just unlimited energy at will.<br>
<br>
We got back to my apartment, put on some music (techno of course--seemed to fit the mood), and by this time it seemed to be getting dark. All kinds of interesting colors revealed themselves in the shadows. After a short amount of time we all realized how much more entertaining it would be for those dancing in my living room to have glow sticks. We went off on a quick run to the local party shop and purshaced all their glow sticks. The party shop had nifty lights and stuff that were all very pleasing to the eye, with lots of flashy colors. Afterwards we went back to my place, watching the quick fluid movements of the light-wands they wielded was very entertaining. At one point or another somebody put a glowstick right in front of my eye and I started drooling, the light felt so good, there was so much sensation from it. My room was lit only by my monitor and a blacklight. That helped too. It made the neon colors really stand out, lots of eye candy.<br>
<br>
Somewhere around there one or two of the people had to do other things so they split. Not long afterwards we went down to the river and played frisby. It was dark at this time so we cut open some glow sticks and put the goo on the frisby so we would see it, that not only made it bright, it had the side effect of littering the ground with glowing dots, and making us glow because it got all over us. We sat in front of the river and contemplated jumping in for a bit. After the glow wore off we went to get something to eat. It was actually like 23:00, it had been 7 hours since anybody had eaten, and we still weren't really hungry, but it feels good to chew on things so we went to a resturaunt that was open late, ordered some food, took a special interest in the moving pattern on the table. Starred at it until our food got there, ate, starred at the floor, then we decided to end the night, so they brought me home and they went home. I spent a couple hours staring at the neato looking changing colors on my ceiling and eventually fell asleep.<br>
<br>
I apologize for not being able to explain/express so many wonderfull and unique aspects of the day, I'm really not doing it justice. In retrospect that was one of the best days of my entire life. It's the kind of thing you never forget and wish you could do again. The first time is definitely the best time, but don't get me wrong, it's very fun all the times following!. :)<!--   End Body   -->

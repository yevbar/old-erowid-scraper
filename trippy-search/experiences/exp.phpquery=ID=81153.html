Let me just start by saying this is purely a research chemical and should be consumed with caution.<br>
<br>
But now on to the fun part, I ordered this stuff off the net having read up on it for a while, I ordered it on a thursday night and it arrived on the monday.<br>
<br>
4pm: monday afternoon<br>
<br>
So here it was infront of me, 4 blue and white capsules filled with 250mg of this white flakey powder, I opened one capsule and emptied on to scales. I decided not to drop the whole 250mg first time, as I said this is largely untested drug and wanted to be safe, so I bombed roughly 125mg, I was sat in my front room with some junglist musik on waiting for the first effects.<br>
<br>
T+ 40mins - first effects are coming on but ever so lightly, I had hyped this drug up quite alot so I figured maybe I was in for a bit of a disappointment.<br>
<br>
T+ 1hr - Starting to rush slightly but still no where near as good as MDMA so I bombed the other 125mg and open the next 250mg capsule and empty on to a CD case, I lined up two 75mg lines so me and a friend could try bumping this stuff<br>
<br>
T+ 1hr 20mins - so after staring at these 2 (visually large) lines for 10 mins I finally stuck the tube up my nose and took the whole line as quick as possible as I have heard awful things about insuffluating this drug.. and boy were the stories true, I lifted my head from the cd case to snort it all back from my nose down my throat and as I did so the pain was incredible, a burning sensation I have never felt from any powder. This lasted about 45 seconds and was quickly followed by vile tasting acid drops   <br>
<br>
T+ 1hr 30mins and I'm starting to wonder if I've been ripped off as I'm still having minor effects, but as I start to wonder about this I feel vibrations in my toes working there way slowly up my leg and all over my body, it feels nice but very physical rather than mental.<br>
<br>
T+ 1hr 45mins - this is such a subtle drug as I dont even notice a change in my perception or anything but I certainly am thinking clearer and am alot more energised, Me and my friend L who had only had a 75mg line decided to have another 50mg line each and bomb another 75mg bringing my total ingested weight too 450mg and his up to 200mg.. the line snorted this time wasnt half as bad as the first line, the burning sensation was far less and the acid drops were alot easier to handle.<br>
<br>
T+ 1hr 50 mins and me and L decide to go for a walk as we are feeling extremely energetic but still no effects I could compare to mdma.<br>
<br>
T+ 2hrs 10mins This walk has turned into something of a wonderland, its almost as if moving around activates this drug, I can feel it surging through my body as I walk, a feeling of total euphoria has washed over me! me and L are talking extremely coherently and there was no apparent change in our appearances either (no overly dilated pupils or gurning) as we walk we both comment on how easy it feels, as if our legs have a seperate mind and we can just let them do their thing.<br>
<br>
T+ 2hr 25mins and we are walking through town, I think I was holding most of the conversation as I think I may have been feeling the effects more than L but he didnt seem concerned by this he just kept saying things along the lines of  'this feels great, I feel great, I feel like I've taken my first pill but BETTER' I think around this time only about 125mg had effected L and maybe 250mg on me, meaning we still had more to come, which felt great.<br>
<br>
T+ 2hrs 35mins We arrive at the head shop we were aiming for and proceed to buy 24 Nitrous oxide whippets, this transaction turned into a 20minute profound discussion between Me, L , And the shop owner... I felt I could talk forever and the shop owner had tried this stuff before and knew exactly where we were coming from, there was a fair bit of perspiration going on but I did not care, the conversation flowed perfectly it seemed for the whole 20 minutes till I decided we best leave to get some balloons for the Nos.<br>
<br>
T+ 3hrs We picked up some balloons and headed home, still huge euphoria from both of us, as we got home we did 1 more 70mg line and 100mg bomb and then proceeded to see how the nitrous effected the initial euphoria.... the answer it seemed was a both satisfying and dis-satisfying one, while the initial nitrous oxide effects were alot softer than usual the following 15mins would have us dancing around like lunatics listening to Vibe Tribe on super bassy speakers...<br>
<br>
T+ 3hrs 50 mins It seems to have just vanished... back to baseline now and wondering what happened to the 70mg lines we just did....<br>
<br>
T+ 4hrs There it is, back up in the clouds, perfectly clear mind but huge euphoria and 'loved up feeling' we start dancing again momentarily before deciding walking is the best idea, we walk maybe 30minutes to the beach and throw stones at the sea, still rushing slightly but far less euphoria and even starting too feel cold now so we have a cigarette and head home. <br>
<br>
overall I'd say this has far overtaken mdma in my books, its far clearer, and when it peaks it really is like nothing I can describe... as for the time period I'm just guesstimating as I was in fact up from 5pm till 10-11ish but I'm being as accurate as possible, I think its the future in raving...<!--   End Body   -->

Well now, I have just had the experience no drug user should ever have to be in...  waking up in the hospital with a stick in your dick, not remembering a damn thing leading up to it, and your parents angrily asking what the hell you took.<BR>
<BR>
I'll start by saying that I come from a very strong, conservative Christian family.  I am a straight A college student majoring in Computer Science, two years into my degree.  I have 4 brothers, 1 sister, two parents, and a 19-year-old cousin all living in the same house.  Thus far, my parents have been unaware of my drug use, but they have been suspicious at times.  Now their worst fears were confirmed and I lost a lot of respect.  They still love me, but I don't think they will ever view me the same way again.<BR>
<BR>
I had just stolen some Vicodin pills from my Grandma (she has a bottomless prescription) and had a prescription for Klonopin and Celexa for 'anxiety' (that I didn't have).  I am only 20 and had trouble getting alcohol, so I bought some mouthwash.  Now it was a Friday and I did not have to work that night.  I planned to trip hard on some allergy pills.  I didn't know what to expect as I had never taken the combination I was planning on.  I'm not sure why I took the Celexa, but I felt that the Vicodin and Klonopin would help with the uncomfortable side effects and make it more of a journey.  Boy was I in for a journey!<BR>
<BR>
6:00 p.m. <BR>
<BR>
I down 30 mg Vicodin (along with the unfortunate but necessary 1500 mg tylenol).  10 minutes later I am beginning to feel very good.  So good in fact, that my judgement begins to weaken.  I suddenly think it would be a good idea to take the Klonopin.  I take one pill.  I wait about 1 minute (!!) impatiently and take another... then another.  I don't notice anything.  My guess is that the Klonopin snuck under the Vicodin and merely weakened my judgement further.  Not to be foiled (I wanted to trip!), I thought it would be a good idea to go into the bathroom and drink some mouthwash.  I downed about 3-4 oz.  For some reason I didn't mind the taste at all.  Then I pop 4 Celexa... without even thinking.<BR>
<BR>
6:30 p.m.  <BR>
<BR>
My parents ask me if I want to go shopping at Costco with them.  I was feeling so good and free that I made the very bad mistake of saying 'sure!'  The ride there felt great.  We walked into the store and I'm rolling a bit.  I was having a bit of trouble keeping my balance.  I told my parents I'd go look in the computer aisle (so I could get away from them).  I was walking around the computer aisle and ALL-OF-A-SUDDEN, out of NOWHERE, I throw up all over myself.  I had sat down very quickly before it came out, but couldn't keep the vomit in.  So now I'm in the computer aisle at Costco with vomit all over me and spreading over the floor.  I used to work there for a year so SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE KNEW ME!!<BR>
<BR>
But I didn't care.  I was high on vicodin, klonopin, and alcohol.  I was numb, carefree, and happy.  I said I was sick and like a cow just waited for them to wipe me up.  I wasn't thinking that my vomit must've smelled strongly of mouthwash!<BR>
<BR>
7:30<BR>
<BR>
Home again, and I'm still feeling great.  I decide it's time to take the Benadryl (NOOOOOOOO!!!!!).  I get out my big Costco-sized bottle and start surfing, reading stories about people tripping.  I go to a movie website and read about some movies.  I pop 8 pills.  About 5 minutes later, I pop 5 more.  Then another 5.  I'm still feeling great, and beginning to feel the allergy-pill high like I never have before.  I go upstairs and drink 2 doses of Nyquil, and a little more mouthwash.  I then go back downstairs and surf the internet popping benadryl.  I had lost control, but I was so fucked up I didn't realize it at the time.  I kept forgetting how much I took, but felt so good that I just kept popping more.<BR>
<BR>
This is where my memory STOPS and I don't remember A THING!!!  That is a VERY SCARY feeling.<BR>
<BR>
My cousin says he found me leaning over a tall dresser in our basement.  He poked me and I just mumbled 'ehhh I'm fiinne'.  Not being familiar with my drug use, he left me for a few minutes.  When he came back, I was crumpled in a heap on the CONCRETE floor (OW!!).  He was unable to arouse me.  He got my parents and they decided to immediately rush me to the hospital.  My breathing was very, very ragged and shallow, and my pulse was faint.  Not wanting my younger brothers to know about this, my parents put me in our van and take me to the hospital as quickly as they can.  <BR>
<BR>
My parents tell me I was completely out for over 5 hours.  Then I started waking up several times, but I don't remember any of those at all.  The only thing I remember was the last time I woke up, and they were asking me stupid questions,<BR>
'Where are you?'<BR>
'In the hospital!  (duh!)'<BR>
<BR>
'Which hospital?'<BR>
'[names correct hospital easily]'<BR>
<BR>
'What's your name?'<BR>
'[says name]'<BR>
<BR>
Well apparently I had woken up many times and kept saying gibberish.  One time I said it was too early to go to school (ha ha!)  <BR>
<BR>
It is now about 4:00 a.m. in the morning, my throat is extremely dry, my dick is VERY sore (which it would be for a couple weeks--DAMN CATHETERS!), and I am too numb to even care.  I stumble out of the hospital bed and back into our van and they start asking me questions.  I hide all my previous drug use and say it was an 'accident'.  I'm still quite messed up but sober enough to understand them now.  They tell me my stomach had been pumped and I tested positive for FOUR different kinds of drugs!  Opiates, Alcohol, Klonopin, and Celexa (it didn't catch the benadryl, apparently).   I get nervous and mention those were my prescriptions, still trying to hide my drug use... pure futility.  They found the open allergy pill bottle next to where I passed out, with pills next to it (presumably, I kept taking them until I passed out... I do not remember this).<BR>
<BR>
I have now come clean with my parents about all my drug use, and have gained some respect back.  I have a ways to go, but I am cleaning up my act and I will now look to meditation and healthy forms of altering consciousness instead of drugs.  I have learned that drugs are only a path to Satan's doorstep... they are so easy; they take no effort.  <BR>
<BR>
My parents said the doctors told them I was in very serious condition and could've gone into cardiac or respiratory arrest, especially if I was not found as early as my cousin found me and had my stomach pumped.  <BR>
<BR>
Please, if you are going to alter your consciousness with drugs, plan beforehand and HIDE any drugs that you may want to take while UNDER THE INFLUENCE.  It almost KILLED ME!<!--   End Body   -->

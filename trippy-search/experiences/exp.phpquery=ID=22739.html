There seems to be very little information around regarding 2C-T-4, but I recently has a chance to try it and so I did.<BR>
<BR>
In the morning I ate a light breakfast and dealt with a few things for a couple of hours. I then brewed and drank some ginger tea, presuming that there may be some nausea ahead, and wanting my 1st experience with this to go well.<BR>
<BR>
0.00 - put 15mg of 2C-T-4 into some juice and drank it down, barely tasted it.<BR>
<BR>
+0.40 - 1st alerts<BR>
<BR>
+1.30 - a slight vivid difference noticed in my visual field.<BR>
<BR>
+2.20 - noticed that there are busy CEVs but they are also very feint.<BR>
<BR>
+4.00 - over the last 2 hours or so the intensity of the OEVs continued to build, reaching the point that for a the 1st time in a long time I engaged in some wall staring, they were nothing amazing but more than I expected. <BR>
After adjusting to the visuals I settled in to wacth a few epsiodes of 'Serial Experiments Lain' (in the course of these 2 hours), which had me transfixed, I felt really involved with the story, and my eyes enjoyed the artwork even more than usual.<BR>
<BR>
Then in the last part of this period I suddenly became distracted, I felt  a sense of deeping of the effects as if my room had suddenly become larger and I could here a deep drum beat somewhere in the distance. For a short while I just sat there and abosorbed this feeling, which I can't easily describe, but at a push I'd say it was like a slow motion genetle version of when 5-meo-dmt 1st hits you in the seconds after you smoke it.<BR>
After I came out of this I decided to write a few notes of what had been going on throughout.<BR>
<BR>
And then it got a bit odd. I looked down at what I had written and the final sentence read 'This is not my writting'. Inital puzzled at this I entered into a verbabl and written dialouge with myself, paid close attention to my environment and mind, and debated the possibility that some other entity had borrowed my hand for a few seconds. I decided I didn't want to dwell on this since the moment seemed to have passed.<BR>
<BR>
+4.30 - still enjoying some effects, but now seems to have stablised into a non-specific trip, with nothing being particularly enchanced, I went about normal tasks, checking mail, reading news, etc quite happily.<BR>
<BR>
+6.20 - things are definately fading away now, a slight headache has developed but it's of no concern. Called some friends and carried out normal conversations with the slightest spaciness.<BR>
<BR>
Throughout the experience, there was some minor disturbance to my stomach, but never approaching what I would call nausea.<BR>
<BR>
I listened to music on and off throughout, but at no point did it really draw my attention, though this could be because I was listening to a random selection of Mp3s, rather than a co-ordinated audio strike.<BR>
I was impressed with the visuals, they were more prominent than on the same (15mg) dose of 2C-T-7, which surprised me. I think that a higher dose (being more easily possible due to the lack of nausea), could yeild some strong visuals (as it stands I would compare them to mild acid visuals).<BR>
<BR>
I was pleased with this overal, and look forward to re-visiting it at some point.<!--   End Body   -->

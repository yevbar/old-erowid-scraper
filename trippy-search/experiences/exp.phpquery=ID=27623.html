Let me first say that I am going on 30 years old, and can count on one hand the number of times I smoked weed in school, and maybe count on two hands the number of times I smoked in school and military combined.  <BR>
<BR>
I have smoked more marijuana in the last 4 months than I ever have.  I got up the nerve to ask my wife if I were to get ahold of some, if she would be mad or try to stop me.  The answer was no.<BR>
<BR>
I have a nice meershaum pipe with a nice case to keep it in, had it since my military days.  I started out rolling joints, but found that to be wasteful and not quite as good of an experience as it is through the pipe.<BR>
<BR>
This is the first pot I've smoked as a grown man with kids, job, responsibility, and I must say it is a totally different experience!  When I was younger, I thought the goal was to get high and go out to a bar, etc.  What I do now is completely different; I'm usually by myself (unless accompanied by my wife) in my nice secluded back yard..usually late at night.  I hardly ever smoke more than one bowl at a sitting, although I may smoke some, then take a bit more outside later.<BR>
<BR>
I do it for the nice mind effects, body effects, and all around good feeling (no big surprise there).  My wife, on the other hand, generally will only do it if she feels like having a <more> enjoyable sexual experience that night.:)<BR>
<BR>
Being 'mature' and engaging in smoking weed, for me, has the goal of making a nice soft cushion to land on after a hard day.  Instead of going to bed mad, worried, anxious about every day things, you go to bed feeling like everything has been lifted, albeit temporarily, from your shoulders.<BR>
<BR>
I absolutely LOVE interacting with my kids while a little stoned (5 years and 1 year).  My 1 year old's babbling is almost recognizable as english, and my 5 year old seems to confide in me more, giving me the feeling that I am a more open person at the time. (I want to make clear that I don't let myself be alone with them at a time like that - my wife takes care of them for the most part when we're home together)<BR>
<BR>
I've never laughed more openly and loudly in my life.  Weed or no weed thats a good thing. <BR>
<BR>
Music is awesome.  My musical tastes are rather eclectic to begin with, but they go off the deep end after a little pot.  I can go from the Dead to Snoop Dogg at the drop of a hat!<BR>
<BR>
My 'experiences' I guess are rather generic, but perhaps from a somewhat different perspective than the typical younger people's often posted here.<!--   End Body   -->

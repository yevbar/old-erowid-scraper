A couple weeks ago my girlfriend and I went to a new head shop in the area just to check it out before we went to a scheduled appointment. After a while some girls came in and asked the guy if they had any Salvia. 'Salvia?' I thought, 'I know what that is.' We had tried finding it before at a different headshop months before, but all we could find is some cheap herbal mix which we ended up throwing away. Anyways, it turns out this shop had it! The leaves and both the 5 and 10X extracts. I was listening to the guy tell the girls not to drive or operate heavy machinery, etc. after smoking. I was definitely interested in learning more so I asked the guy some questions. He pretty much told me what I already knew, so I decided I would have to try it some time. We left.<BR>
<BR>
A couple of weeks later we went back and bought the 5X for around $22 a gram. I had been reading information and trip reports pretty much non-stop since then. I let my friend know I had the goods and we decided I would try it first and then him. I did all the things I needed to do that day and soon enough, the time was getting near. We actually had to go get a screen for his pipe though because the salvia was pretty fine and would have been sucked through the hole. So, after we were on our way back, I began to get some butterflies in my stomach, because of what was soon to take place. From what I've read, it's perfectly undestandable to be somewhat apprehensive!<BR>
<BR>
Anyways, we got back to his house and he started cleaning. He brought his dog in and started playing some music a little too loudly, and not really the appropriate music either. I asked him if he could put his dog out and if I could put on some other music that I brought. (Shamanic Dream by Anugama) After he complied, I tried to weight out .10g on the scale I had but for some reason it wasn't working so I just guesstimated. The screen fit pretty good, I had the torch lighter, the lights were dimmed, music was playing softly in the background, and I was ready to go. <BR>
<BR>
I lit the bowl and inhaled all the smoke in. Holding it for as long as I could, I finally let it out, which was practically nothing. About ten seconds later, I could tell something was happening. I definitely felt very heavy, and sound seemed a little more distinct. It was kinda like being pretty stoned, but very clear headed though. I decided to do another bowl, but more this time. Hitting the bowl, I was almost able to get it all. Nonetheless, I had a full lungfull. Held it as long as I could, then slowly let it out in short breaths. Five seconds later, I knew it was gonna get me good. <BR>
<BR>
I laid my head back and let it take over. I'ts definitely really hard to explain what happened, but I'll try my best. It was as if I was seeing a cartoonish appearance of what was happening to me at the time and where I was, but I was sort of disembodied. I heard my friend saying things but I wasn't even paying attention. I was thinking, 'Is this what it's supposed to be like?' and kinda expecting more. I eventually opened my eyes and had the really heavy feeling. It was kinda like I just blacked out, but still conscious of what was going on in the real world at the same time.<BR>
I told my friend it was his turn, this stuff definitely does some weird things to you! He HAD to try this. He looked a little nervous but finally sat down to a bowl I prepared for him.<BR>
<BR>
He hit it and put the pipe down. He then just kinda stared forward, maybe looking around a bit. He didn't look too deep into it so I got up and went to the bathroom after a minute or so. I heard him start saying things which didn't make any sense. I came back and sat down. He swears he said to me 'Hop on!' because later he told me some kind of force was lifting him up and he wanted me to go. He was also saying the floor folded up on itself or something like that. It was time for me to have some more....<BR>
<BR>
I loaded a pretty good sized bowl and took the hit. Held it for as long as I could, then blew out. Took the rest of what was in the bowl, then put the pipe down. Here it came. I put my head back again and closed my eyes. Again, I can't recall much. It did seem like I was in a different time. Maybe earlier in my childhood. (I was in fact in a house which is on the street where I grew up, so maybe that had some influence.) It was like I was either in the corner of a house or the actual corner of the house itself. I was saying 'Yeah I know.' and 'What?' and 'Come on!' from what I remember. I was also moving my hands in weird ways on my stomach and making weird noises with my mouth. I think this was my way of trying to keep in touch with reality. I actually remember doing these things. It was as if I knew something had happened to me but I didn't know what. Like I had done a drug and had maybe gone too far this time. And I was thinking 'Where am I?' and 'What's going on?'. Opening my eyes would somewhat bring me back to reality, but I wanted the experience to last, so I closed my eyes. I could sense that the outside world was there but I was trapped in this other world. I kinda heard my friend again off and on and it was like I could see myself moving around and making these noises, but I didn't know why. The fact that I had just smoked salvia really didn't matter either. <BR>
<BR>
Then I realized that I did smoke something and it was kinda the reason I was acting that way but was I prolonging it on purpose? It seemed like it was more comfortable to be this way. I was also babbling some incoherent nonsense which seemed to make sense to me. But who was I talking to? Ms. Salvia maybe? I don't know because I really didn't see anyone. It did seem that if I WAS talking to someone, they were behind me and to the right. Maybe it was her. Maybe I was sitting in the corner for doing something bad? I would also laugh for a bit then instantly become quiet. Anyways, eventually I stopped moving my hands and came out of the trance. I had the heavy stoned feeling as well. Getting up and moving around was strange. I felt somewhat drunk and uncoordinated. <BR>
<BR>
Then my friend decided to go again. He took the hit and put the pipe down. After ten seconds or so, he started reaching his arms out like he was trying to touch something. His mouth was open like he was just looking around a things in awe. He would even turn his head to the side like he saw someone. This started to freak me out because I thought maybe he had done too much or he was just completely gone, and for good. He also started talking to someone, and later he said it was my mom and another person. He is an artist and had a huge painting set up in his place. He said he saw the painting slide to the floor, become carpet, and split in two directions. He also said he saw one of those huge balloons they have at parades like the Macy's Day Parade. It was a leopard and it swooped in and made a u-turn right in front of us.<BR>
<BR>
Thinking back, I just can't believe something can do that to you. It was unbelievable. Totally different from anything I have tried. Someone said it best when they said salvia doesn't distort reality, it creates it's own, and pulls you in. Outside stimuli didn't affect me at all. Everything was internal. I could hear the music in the background but it didn't really affect me at all. The experience really wasn't that scary except when I tried to figure out what was going on. Letting go and flowing with it definitely helped. From an outside observer, it probably looked like I was schizophrenic because I was just moving my hands around, laughing, then stopping, and babbling nonsense.<BR>
<BR>
I wouldn't say it was fun, just very strange and interesting. You enter a whole new world. I was eager to do my second bowl when I realized what it could do. I can't wait to try it again, and hopefully I can go deeper. I still have about 1/3 left of my 5X bag and I'm gonna try to get my other friend to do it. Hopefully it won't get scheduled anytime soon.<!--   End Body   -->

I heard about salvia first from a friend who did it and thought they were in a cartoon so i thought it was pretty cool. I researched its effects online and thought i'd try it out.<br>
<br>
I started sitting in a chair on my deck with three friends. I took the first hit of salvia from a pipe and almost immediately felt its effects. A couple seconds after I blew out the smoke one of my friends asked if I felt anything. I did not respond to this and seconds later I was pulled backwards into blackness and was no longer on my deck (mentally).<br>
<br>
I did not speak at all and could not hear the people around me. Apparently I had stood up and started walking around my deck but I do not recall this. My mind was spinning in this vortex of designs and colors that I can not put into words and I heard the same loud noises over and over again. It sounded like thousands of metal figures were crashing together in a repeated pattern. I could not control my body at all during these hallucinations. I don’t know how long any of this was going on because time meant nothing.<br>
<br>
I could now see a huge freighting image of my brother grabbing onto me and trying to pull me back into the endless spinning. I started fighting away from him to escape and he was struggling to keep control of me. I thought he was against me and was trying to keep me inside this horrible world. I heard him over the other noises say, “What extract did he have?” and moments later I was in the chair again on my deck but I was still hallucinating. <br>
<br>
I saw chains of consecutively numbered blocks about the size of big legos. These chains held me down and I could move at all. I also could not speak because I felt like my face was stuck in one spot. I was afraid that I was still going to be stuck there when my mom got home and would learn what I did. My brother and friends were all huddled around me and my brother was asking them who gave it to me. Then one friend said, “It’s all going to be ok just stay in the chair.” I felt like my friends were all against me and tricked me into doing this purposely to teach me a lesson about taking drugs. This was just paranoia. <br>
<br>
They all said that I was holding my hands around my neck like i was choking and I was breathing very weird. I also was looking at my reflection in the window and looked very confused. Then somehow I was on a lawn chair on the bottom of the deck and my brother was just pulling the last chain of blocks out me. When the last one came out I was pretty much back in the real world and everyone was huddled around me. I started saying things like “What just happened?” My brother was taking my pulse and it was going incredibly fast and I was sweating really badly. He told me to run out into the lawn because he wanted to see if I was ok. I ran out and was having trouble standing but made it. When I got out into the lawn I was thinking why I just did that and what the fuck just happened. <br>
<br>
I went to sit on the deck to comprehend this madness and I could not stay in one spot and stared flipping out because of the intense heat and confusion. It was like I was in this fucked up dream where anything could happen and when I 'woke up' I did not really remember what happened and it took time to recall the events. This drug is very intense and should not be messed with. It has taught me a valuable lesson about life and I am a little iffy about doing it again because I fear the same or a similar experience.<!--   End Body   -->

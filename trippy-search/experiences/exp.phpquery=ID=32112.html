This was the craziest trip I have ever had...way more intense than a BIG toke of DMT.<br>
<br>
I took the 2CI first @ 9pm anally in a gel cap. I was a normally pleasurable experince with mild sensual feelings combined with acid-like visuals that set in within about 20 min.<br>
<br>
I was at a friends house party, so the environment was safe and comfortable for a new experience.<br>
<br>
At 11pm I inserted the 2CT2 gel cap into my anus. Basically 10 minutes after I did it, the entire world as I knew it began to mesh togther into a strange tunnel.<br>
<br>
I had the strangest auditory hallucinations, as if someone was speaking on a PA system, and the laughter around me was in echoed unison. Every sound had a lazer like quality to it, and the music beats were so deep and peircing. It was defintely sensory overload.<br>
<br>
It was impossible to move, to say anything, to comprehend what people were saying to me ... I was in a different dimension. I managed to get myself to the bathroom, which was an adventure of its own, and the bathroom wasn't even 10 feet away. I looked insane on the bathrroom mirror..seriuosly like a cartoon caracter, something fantastical from Shrek or the cat in the hat...THESE were visuals...Everything was strobing, with tracers, it was impossible to focus on anything. There are so few words to describe what was happening in my mind at the time...<br>
<br>
The time was soo intense that by the time I got out of the bathroom I started thinking how it was NEVER going to end, and how I was going to go to work on monday etc...this was BAD...I got in a total rut, and it was aweful. At this point the only thing that could 'save' me was going home...that was hard since I was convinced I was going to die and needed to be in a hospital....well anyways I got home in the end.<br>
<br>
This was a REALLY intense trip ... not recommended for newbies.<!--   End Body   -->

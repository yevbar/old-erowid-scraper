I am only 14, yet I have experienced the worst living hell: addiction. I was only addicted to it for about 6 months, but it was enough time for me to spiral down and hit rock bottom.<br>
<br>
My first experience with speed, was in early June '04. One of my best friends got her hands on some high quality crystals, and I snorted my first line on the floor of a public bathroom in a park near where I live. I instantly loved the burn of the tiny crystals hitting the inside of my nose. I loved the feeling of the drip sliding down my throat. I loved the intense way it made me feel like god. From then on, every extra cent I got, went toward my growing habit.<br>
<br>
Soon, snorting wasn't giving me enough of a rush, so I proceeded to start slamming it, injecting wherever I had veins. I had been injecting random drugs since I was 13, so I wasn't new to the cold prick of the needle. My veins proceeded to become bruised blue and purple, a little rosebud forming after each injection until they were scarred beyond repair. I can still see the scars today.<br>
<br>
I finally hit rock bottom after buying an $80 bag and splitting it with my friend. I looked like a skeleton. 97 pounds of skin and bone. I remember the last time taking it. In the bathroom stall of some run-down hall where they held shows. At this point, doing tweak was a chore. It wasn't fun anymore. The only way I could be normal is if I had it running through my veins. I had injected it previously at my house, and I didn't have a spoon or rig with me, so I had to snort it. I did about $35 worth in one sitting, and after I pulled my head up, I wheeled backwards and slammed into the wall.<br>
<br>
I didn't love the burn, I didn't love the drip, I didn't love the rush. It was like an old boyfriend whose turned his back on you. Both me and my friend made a pact with each other in that old bathroom: that we would never do it again. We knew that all we had to look forward to was a horrible come-down, that we'd pushed upon ourselves. I spent the next three days mentally exhausted, ready to die. I became sick because all of my immunities had been destroyed. I was sick for 2 weeks. Bed ridden, thrashing with fever, hallucinating for hours upon hours. Eventually I got better, and I didn't experience any cravings for about a month, which is amazing to me. Everything I had loved before about speed, I mentally gagged at.<br>
<br>
So far, I've been clean for 2 months, and the cravings have finally appeared. I know I'm going to do it again, but I'll never EVER let myself go like I did before. I'm not going to waste my money on that bullshit again. I gave too much of my life to it that time, and I'm not going to make that mistake again, yet I will always be addicted to it. I keep a composition book with me at all times, and write in it whenever I need to escape. This is an excerpt I wrote on 12/12/04:<br>
<br>
'with the stuff I do...you don't escape...you face all of your fears and weaknesses and you just beat 'em up. But the biggest weakness just gets bigger without you knowing it.'<!--   End Body   -->

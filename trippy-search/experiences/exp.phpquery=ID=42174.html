I am a fairly well experienced drug user, a common side-effect to frequenters of the rave scene. One drug I have never before used was shrooms, although I've always been curious. So, when offered the chance by my friend, I immediately agreed. I decided to buy two 1/8ths, one for me and the other for a friend, John. I decided not to eat anything the Friday I was to try the shrooms, although I ended up having a salad after eating the shrooms. About half an hour later, John decided to eat his, and we sat in his room watching our college basketball team on TV.<br>
<br>
Roughly 40 minutes after ingestion, things felt different. I became extremely talkative, I just couldn't stop talking. I decided I didn't want to make a fool of myself, so I stared at my jeans. Wow, they were flowing. It was subtle at first, but the patterns on my jeans were constantly flowing towards my toes, strange. Soon after, another friend came and said we were goin on a trip, so get in the car. John and I got in the car and we drove to another friends house. We arrived at Jay's house and we sat down to watch him play xbox. He was playing some basketball game where whenever a combo was performed, the screen would change colors, I wondered if this was an effect of the shrooms, pretty soon the entire room started changing colors with the screen. John mentioned that the ceiling fan was casting some pretty trippy shadows on the ceiling and we proceeded to stare at that for god knows how long.<br>
<br>
Up until this point, the trip was going pretty good, although I was hoping for something more intense. That all changed. A group of Jay's friends suddenly showed up and started passing around a bong. These guys were absolute assholes. At this point I got very introspective and questioned why I was doin shrooms, I felt like I was actually talking to a subconcious part of my brain that I have never met before, the part that just quietly does its business, keeping me alive, doing all the functions that I as a human was too ignorant or too simple to understand and I was incredibly ashamed of this.<br>
<br>
Back to reality, I realized that being at my friends house (he lives in our dorm, but I had never been to his house before) around a group of dickhead strangers was probably not the best place to be on shrooms. I promptly went to the bathroom and puked. Finally John and I hitched a ride back to the dorms and I left him to go watch TV in my room. My roommate was there, he just got back from working out and was doing pushups. I laid on my bed and stared at him, thinking about how much importance he placed on his outward appearance. The shrooms hit me hard at this point. I was literally left speechless, my roommate kept asking me what it was like, what I was seeing, but I was honestly so damn confused I couldnt even speak. Being around my roommate was a horrible idea, as he brought in some of his friends and they all gawked at me, made weird faces at me and acted like they were staring at a zoo animal. The funny thing about this was that I was seeing them as zoo animals, making weird faces and acting immature, laughing at someone who was experiencing something they couldn't understand.<br>
<br>
John came back to my room and asked if we should smoke some pot, I immediately realized this was a great idea, it would chill me out and get me away from my roommate. The walk to the river smoking spot was strange, the stars in the sky took on an unrealistically large appearance and every time we tried to start a conversation I would visualize all the various paths the conversation could take. I was traveling all of these paths in my head and actual speech was impossible. We smoked, headed back and made top ramen noodles. At this point I felt that the experience was over, John was definetly back to baseline, but when I went to add the flavoring to the ramen, I saw amoebas and bacteria crawling around the soup! I told John, 'I can't eat these man, there are bugs in it!' but I could never manage to scoop one up with my spoon and show him. All in all, the experience was at times frightening, but I learned a lot about the people around me. It wasn't quite as visual as I was expecting, it was a lot more mentally stimulating, but everyone reacts differently.<!--   End Body   -->

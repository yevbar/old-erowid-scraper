<!--   Start Body   -->


Something has been taken over and I cannot feel.  My face is numb and my tongue explains a sensation of a million stakes splitting it in thirds.  Every thing seems to start with this pain yet it does not hurt.  Contradiction is a big part of this account yet I am not using it as a poetic tool.  After I seem to slip,  my mind has a Pseudo-Lapse times to melt as I sit still in a arm chair.  I try to calm but the overcoming fear has set in once again.  <BR>
<BR>
My face becomes numb and my earsdrums seem to be sedated and the ears them selves filled with paste.  I try to make myself yawn like you do when you come down with a cold and stay home from work.  Unlike those other times the pressure built up in them stays.  I have no idea what is going on and I stand up.  I walk to the kitchen to descend into the basement but when I hit the first step a feeling rips through me I cannot explain.  I see a friend in a black Polaroid comment 'You are going to die,  you are having a heart attack...' My heart slowly starts to accelerate like 2 turbo charged cars at a stop light starting up for a race.  140,  150,  160,  170 then 180 could have been more but I was too confused to continue.  I can hear someone calling me and a crazy idea came to me...  Am I in a coma? Maybe this is all fake.  I try and scream out to tell them I’m alright but nothing comes of this.  <BR>
<BR>
I come over this stupid idea and try to smile.  I succeed but my heart is racing so fast that my eyes are shaking and I can see my tshirt moving up and down with every beat.  I sit down again and try to remain calm but it still beats over and over.  The walk downstairs was totally forgotten,  I recall the whole experience but it seems so animated like a comic book. I do not feel in control and I feel like some astral spirit is gripping me. I can feel an almost electric pulse of my heart going in my chest.  I am convinced there is a true form of electricity pulsing from my heart knowing that is how they revive a stopped heart.  I decide to go eat an orange it seems to maybe help some I was moon leaping on grey carpet traveling through loopholes in time.  I am not sure what happened and what is happening I could be minutes ahead of my self or I could be seconds behind. <BR>
I could feel something coming up my throat but it didn’t hurt. It was more of a negative feeling.  I had a small burp and it persisted.  <BR>
<BR>
What is going on,  I am sick of being in this madness my heart will not stop its tantrum I will not shut up.  I express my worries aloud but no one listens.  All this has come off of a small bit of reg's and prescriptions I am authorized to take.  It happens every time I smoke.  I do not get 'high' I only become attacked by this force.  It is not cool like some of you might think.  It is not a bad trip it is just madness.  I feel my heart beating in my hollow chest like I will never see the light again.  It feels like my heart is in a cavity with nothing around it.  I am my heart my brain and the rest of my body is detached...  I am beating at 180 beats per minute will I explode.  Time skips by and it is not enjoyable I feel like I am not in control.  It is not formable or moldable I can not enjoy or create I am just floating in and out of myself.<!--   End Body   -->

<!--   Start Body   -->


I've been waiting to receive a shipment of psychoactives for about a month.  I just got home from school around 6:30 to do some quick tests.  My mindset was one of anticipation and excitement, I had a bad day but I tried to clear all negative thoughts from my head.  This was hard because the past few days hadn't been so great.  I have never done any of the things I did before, it was probably rash to mix so many drugs, but I'd done extensive research and concluded they were safe to have together.<BR>
<BR>
T:0<BR>
I placed a few sun opener leaves in a bowl, and sprinkled about 15 mg of Kanna on top of it.  I smoke the bowl.  The Kanna has almost a sweet taste, it's a little harsh and pleasant.  It crackles a little bit.  The sun opener is harsh and bitter tasting, the smoke from it however smells excellent, like good incense.  I than place another 15 mg or so in my mouth and chew.  I had so little of the Sun Opener it is unlikely that it was active, and I didn't feel any of its effects.<BR>
<BR>
T: +10 minutes:  <BR>
The effects of the Kanna are felt almost immediately.  I think I felt the effects strongly because I have naturally low serotonin, and suffer from dystimia (very minor depression) maybe a month ago I was put on Lexapro. I had discontinued this medication about a week ago.  It is likely that my bad mood of late was partly based of this.  Kanna, which is a short term SSRI, seemed to do the trick.  I was cracking jokes, and generally in good spirits.  I didn't feel high but I did feel altered.<BR>
<BR>
T: +45 Bowl of Sacred Blue, and a Bowl of Pot<BR>
Euphoric effects of Kanna continue, they feel stronger at this point.  I have left my house and driven to a field with my friend where we often smoke.  I decide to pack a very large bowl of Sacred Blue Lotus.  It tastes and smells excellent, It's a pleasure to toke.  At this point my friend sparks a bowl of pot (the pot isn't quite headies but it's still excellent dro.)  As soon as I take the first hit I feel very high.  I don't feel pot high, but all of a sudden the Lotus high comes into focus.  It has a different texture than a pot high.  I felt very lucid, and energized.  There was a full moon out, and I noticed it for the first time.  I sort of zoned out staring at the moon and thinking how incredible it looked.  It stood out on its own, had a different feel than everything else.  I can't really explain it but it was interesting, and pleasant.  We finished the bowl of pot, and headed back to the car.  <BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: It is extremely dangerous and irresponsible to drive while under the influence of a psychoactive substance. Don't do it!]</font><BR>
<BR>
My friend suggested that I, 'chill' with the lotus for a while because I look like someone on drugs.  I explained that I could focus and that I felt completely in control, just that I felt extremely altered.  I felt clear-headed, thoughts flowed easily but I had trouble thinking about anyone thing for to long.<BR>
<BR>
T: 1:15<BR>
Smoke two more bowls of pot while driving around.  The pot high does not take over I still feel the same but more so.<BR>
<BR>
T: 2:00<BR>
Drink some green tea, smoke one last bowl and go home.  I watch TV for about an hour.  I'm ripped.<BR>
<BR>
T: 2:30<BR>
Make myself some valerian root tea, and I threw in some salvia leave just for kicks.<BR>
<BR>
T: 2:45<BR>
I'm ready for some more experiments.  I have some music on and the lights out, I burn a bowl of Salvia D. I use a butane lighter, and hold the smoke in for a long time.  Nothing.  I repeat.  I repeat a third time.  I decide to pack a fourth bowl this time mixed with some Sacred Lotus for taste.  The salvia tastes like shit on it own, with the Lotus however it's fine.  I smoke this last bowl and I begin to feel something.  When I close my eyes I see patterns, and a few vivid pictures.  Only for a few seconds does it actually seem real though.  With my eyes open I feel altered, and things look strange but beyond that, nothing happens.  I feel this way for about 15 minutes.<BR>
<BR>
I was disappointed with the Salvia, hoping for some sort of spiritual experience.  I plan to make the extract to get things going for real.  But for sure, Lotus and Kanna are great with Cannabis.  It was a great experience.<!--   End Body   -->

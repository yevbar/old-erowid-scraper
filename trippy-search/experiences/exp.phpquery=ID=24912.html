<!--   Start Body   -->


Subject consumed 'methylone' 2-methylamino-1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)propan-1-one<BR>
<BR>
Nutshell Description: Emotional Psychedelic<BR>
<BR>
Journalistic Description: Dose was administered dissolved in water, divided into to two (2) 100 mg samples.<BR>
<BR>
Subject has had no previous experience with MDMA, or other 'empathogenic' drugs.<BR>
<BR>
Subject has had previous experience with stimulants (caffeine, amphetamines) and hallucingens (LSD, psilocybin.)<BR>
<BR>
  9 min, 40 sec:  Odd sensation that 'something's happening'<BR>
<BR>
~ 10 min: Strange, full sensation under collarbone<BR>
<BR>
> 10 min: Warmth, beginning in face, spreading to neck and chest, feverish feeling, colors become brighter, hair on back of neck begins to stand up<BR>
<BR>
~ 15 min: feeling giddy, 'silly', playful, short-term memory failing<BR>
<BR>
~ 20 min: increased attention to environment, things become 'softer' around the edges, some similarities to alcohol intoxication, without the dizziness or other ill sensations<BR>
<BR>
~ 45 min: Feels fun! Consume additional 100 mg<BR>
<BR>
> 45 min - 4 hrs: some tactile enchancement, things feel soft to the touch... driving energy building in mind, and not neccessarily pleasant... loss of fear of thoughts that would otherwise seem scary, conversation on telephone with friend... feel an urge to tell everything becoming very apologetic... great sense of social responsibility, sense of having wasted life... does NOT feel like being in love.... mental energy/effects seem to come in waves... feel like I am confessing to a priest... very positive verbally, but it almost feels like being /forced/ to be positive. Not so much a blissful euphoria, as a driven desire to help other people.  Reminiscent of the Ren and Stimpy episode where Ren is made to wear the 'happy helmet.'<BR>
<BR>
~ 4 hrs: Sleep comes easily, but is light.<BR>
<BR>
>16 hours: Awake, feeling OK,... much calmer than usual. Slight tremor in hands when at rest (goes away with intention, such as beginning to write with a pen) which continues off and on throughout the day. Lack of usual social fear... paying more attention to people's faces without feeling the need to look away.<BR>
<BR>
Personal Description:<BR>
I went over to the domicile of my friend, 'Igor', who had some pure methylone, and had tried it before and survived. Igor gave me 200 mg of methylone, dissolved in water; 100 mg of which I consumed on the spot, and 100 mg I saved for later.  Set my stopwatch, though not planning to keep a journal.<BR>
<BR>
Walking home with Igor, I searched myself for any effects different from ordinary adrenaline/anxiety... I started feeling funny, looked at my watch, and it had only been 9 minutes and 40 seconds.  We were talking about various things, but I started having trouble following the conversation. I felt flushed and feverish, and suddenly it wasn't so important /what/ Igor was saying, but just the fact that I was there, listening to it. I wanted very much to be a good listener.<BR>
<BR>
Arriving home, I was overwhelmed with gratitude towards Igor, ... so kind of him to walk me home!  I wanted to ask him to stay, but knew he had to retire for the evening.  I resigned myself to riding out the experience alone, unsure of whether walking around the town would be safe in that condition.<BR>
<BR>
Feeling good at this point, I decided to take the remaining 100 mg, <BR>
(Igor had suggested taking this supplement at the 45 min. mark).<BR>
<BR>
Settled down on my couch, and noticed it was satisfying just to touch it.  Stared at the wall, quite contented for a while... <BR>
<BR>
............. then it hit me.<BR>
<BR>
It came on like waves rolling up the beach, a sudden, strange energy like somone was pushing buttons inside my head,... moving things around.  It was very strange, not what I had expected at all.  I felt a sudden deep pang of guilt for all the bad things, and even thoughts I had had in my life, and a resolve to do better by other people in the future.  I saw how I had been cruel, even to myself all these years (quite forgetting the reasons for this 'cruelty'... the necessity of surviving.) I called up another friend, Frank, who has had experience with many psychedelics, (but not this one), and talked to him and his girlfriend, Stella. I blathered on and on, jumping from one train of thought to another... it was much like the feeling you get when you're a little kid, and you've done something wrong, and you're confessing it to your mother. There was a tendency to apologize a lot... unneccesarily.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, Frank and Stella got tired and went to bed; I stared at the wall for a while, in silent contemplation.  It was starting to wear off by now.  It seemed to me almost as if the different lobes of my brain had become detatched, and were now communicating along different channels, like I was sorting things out within myself.<BR>
<BR>
It reminded me of similar emotional states under the influence of psilocybin... but WITHOUT the confusion, time-dialation, or hallucinations.<BR>
<BR>
I remember thinking 'This is going to change my life!  Life will be <BR>
different from now on!'<BR>
<BR>
Then.... I went to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
I woke up with no hangover, or other ill effects, except I was dehydrated and my hands would tremble... a tremor that would go away when I paid attention to it. (I tested this by picking up a pen and trying to write.)  I felt different, very calm... emotionally very calm. My concentration wasn't up to par, but it improved as the day went on.<BR>
<BR>
In retrospect it seems very strange to me.  That is, it seems so strange that a simple chemical (methylone or seritonin) could cause such a complicated pattern of thought or behaviour (concern for the welfare and feelings of others.) It makes me feel too mechanical.  I'm no longer sure this was a life-changing experience, though. It seemed very real at the time,... but in retrospect, it all seems phony.<BR>
<BR>
In the right environment, however, this compound might be useful for psychotherapy and relationship problems. Hopefully, time will prove it to be safe.<BR>
<BR>
In no way, shape or form do I recommend that anyone else take methylone!!!  So little is known about the toxicity of this chemical, that what I did was very irresponsible. For all I know, I may have destroyed millions of important brain cells. That being said, I have decided that the best I can do is to post this account of my recollection of the experience, and expand the body of knowledge on it.<!--   End Body   -->

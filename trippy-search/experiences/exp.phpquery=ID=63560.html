I had taken morphine for the first time ever about a week or so before this specific event. I loved it. It was the greatest drug I had ever taken, perfection in pill form. Everything about it was perfect. The only side effect was constant iching, but it felt GREAT to scratch it. If there was a way to describe morphine in one word, that word would be orgasm. <br>
<br>
Well, one week or so later, my friend [who I'll refer to as E] and I acquired 2 200mg pills, the guy we got them from said not to take more than half each at a time. So we put them away until the next morning before school. The next morning I quickly rode my bike to E's house before school at 7 am. Our school started at 8 15 am, so we had plenty of time to enjoy the morphine. As soon as I got there, we pulled out the morphine tablets and cut one in half and downed them with water. During our last encounter with morphine we had discovered that smoking a bowl or two alongside it enhanced the morphine high, and almost doubled the pleasure. So we decided to smoke two bowls right after taking the pills. By the time the weed high hit us the morphine hit, it was perfection again.<br>
<br>
By this time it was 7:30 am, we still had plenty of time to chill. But seeing as E's bike had been stolen a few days beforehand we decided to walk to school, which is halfway across our small town. So we head toward school enjoying the sweet sweet high of morphine. The walk to school was so enjoyable, there were no aches, every step felt so good, and I felt happy and enjoyed just holding a conversation and walking down the road. <br>
<br>
But then something unexpected happened, I vomited, I didn’t feel the vomit coming out, but the horrid taste was still there. It was a bad sign but we continued to school anyway. The morphine high was still just as good as ever, and we made it to school 5 minutes before the bell rung, still feeling wonderful. <br>
<br>
Once in class I found we were just finishing an assignment from the day before which I had already completed. So I decided to lay my head on my desk and drift into a deep, warm morphine sleep. But when I awoke everything took a turn for the worst. All the previous euphoria and pleasure had been removed and I was left extremely nauseated and exhausted. I headed to the bathroom because I felt the need to vomit, but the bathroom was on the other side of the school but I managed to get there in time, I vomited a nasty fluid into the toilet, realizing that it was stomach bile, as I had not eaten anything since the afternoon before. After vomiting, I did not feel better like I did that morning, and I left the bathroom hoping the worst was over. <br>
<br>
I looked in the mirror as I was washing my hands and I saw a ghost looking back at me. Not literally, no hallucination, but my face was extremely pale and absolutely colorless and my pupils were dilated and my eyes were bloodshot. I looked horrible and I was sure people could tell something was wrong. I headed back to class and once there went straight to sleep, I didn’t have energy enough to sit up straight in my desk, and instantly knocked out. I was awakened by the bell, and another trip to the restroom to vomit my stomach bile out. Now to 2nd period. It was horrible. I had to spend the entire class period in the restroom because I asked to use the bathroom and threw up outside the door of the class, returned and had to leave, but didn’t make it yet again. When I came back my teacher could tell something was wrong and she sent me to the nurse. <br>
<br>
I was fucked for sure. If I went to the nurse she would know what was wrong, and that I had taken morphine. I spent the rest of this block in the bathroom hiding awaiting lunch so I could try and get something into me. After vomiting some 15 times more, the bell for lunch finally rang. I headed out to the cafeteria and bought an ice cream cone and gatorade trying to take it easy. I was stupid for thinking I could even eat it. From the first bite the nausea and pain throughout my body, which was already intense, worse than any sickness had ever made me feel, doubled completely, and I left my lunch on the table and hurried to the restroom where I spent the rest of lunch period. This process continued for the rest of the day, and by 3rd period my girlfriend had discovered what was wrong, and she was worried and pissed. Everyone had noticed now that something was wrong and they were all asking questions. I couldn’t take it anymore I needed to get out of this place.<br>
<br>
Finally, the bell to leave sounded and we all filed out of school. I met up with E who had enjoyed his high well, and my girlfriend and we awaited our rides. My girlfriend left after telling E never to let me do morphine again. E and I knew that we couldn’t walk to his house with me like this, so we called his stepmom for a ride and once there I tried to drink a Mountain Dew but it made me vomit over and over once again. <br>
<br>
It was then that I decided I had to go home, even if I felt like I was dying. And E and I walked to my house and it got to a point where E had to hold me up and help me walk because I couldn’t stand myself. Once I finally reached my house I went up to my room and lay down with a bowl for vomit and suffered the remainder of the morphine out of my system.<br>
<br>
Finally it was over, and I learned the problem behind this. I talked to the guy we got the morphine from and he said he forgot to tell us to eat before taking it. Damnit. Goddamnit. I can't believe all that pain just because a simple thing like not eating. Still, I loved the morphine more than any other substance the first time I tried it. But I will never touch it again, not after vomiting my brains out. How can something go from so good to so horrible, just because of a simple mistake? Maybe I'll never know.<!--   End Body   -->

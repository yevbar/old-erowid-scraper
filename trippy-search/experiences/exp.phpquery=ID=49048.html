This was my first trip using ayahuasca. I've taken mescaline, LSD, mushrooms, and all the common psychadelics before. As usual I read up on my next trip as much as possible. I had obtained the mimosa and syrian rue a few months before, but lacking a kitchen I had to wait to get home to boil the mimosa. I prepared them the night before last. I used 15 grams of mimosa hostilis and first boiled that for about 20 minutes in a 1:3 cup ratio of lemon juice and water. Then I boiled the mimosa again in a slightly smaller amount of lemon juice and water in the same ratio. I combined and let it boil down for about 45 minutes until I had a very small (less than 100 mL) amount of extract. The syrian rue I crushed the next day and put into gel capsules.<BR>
<BR>
I had prepared to trip last night because my parents would be away and I was hoping some of my friends would come over to accompany me. Unfortunately, one of my friends always seems to be tied up with dealing morphine which is pretty sketchy. No one else was free that night, but I decided to go ahead with it anyway. I must say since I knew the trip would last about five hours and my parents would only be gone for about five hours, I felt a little apprehensive about them coming home early with me still tripping. I also tried to approach this trip with the right mindset, that of respecting the power of ayahuasca and hoping it would give me some wisdom along the way. Unfortunately, I have been doubting my own reasons of tripping as of late. I can not tell whether I'm doing it for fun or for a more serious purpose, but it seems to be both. <BR>
<BR>
5:40: I take the syrian rue capsules and hope that my friend, K, will make it over to my house soon. I haven't eaten anything at this point since about 1:20.<BR>
<BR>
6:15: I take the mimosa hostilis (after finding out that K will not be able to make it over till later). The mimosa tastes bad, but I can only taste its extreme sourness. It's even worse than a lemon which makes sense because its super concentrated lemon juice and the extract of mimosa hostilis. All the water was boiled off. Its still not nearly as bad as eating an ounce of dried Peruvian torch cactus tissue. I also have a vaporizer which is filled with weed. I vape it right after finishing the mimosa.<BR>
<BR>
6:20: The ayahuasca already seems to be kicking in. This stuff comes on fast. I begin getting waves of what can only be described as evil anxiety. I begin seeing grinning faces in the trees but I'm not too worried. <BR>
<BR>
6:25: I feel my heartbeat (using my finger on my neck- I wouldn't trust what I feel in my head, I've read too many reports of people freaking out because they believe their heart rate is 200 when its really normal). Its actually going really fast though. I attribute it to the weed (which increases HR) and probably the MAOI. I actually panic for a few moments believing that I might have eaten something with Tyrosine in it too soon before the trip. Its beginning to get hard to walk.<BR>
<BR>
6:40?: I have a lot of nausea at this point and I come back inside. I attempted to listen to Dark Side of the Moon at this point but the music isn't enhanced by the ayahuasca. Overpowering nausea and feelings of wrongness overcome me. I go to the bathroom and sit trying to let myself throw up, but I can't. I eventually make myself throw up because I just want that feeling of nausea to go away.<BR>
<BR>
6:50?: The trip is not nearly as intense as it was, although visuals are interesting. I am not a visual person, unfortunately, so for example, while my friends may see dancing gnomes on a few hits of acid I would just see shifting and flowing surfaces, maybe a few fractals but nothing more. I was able to see the cabinets in my living room sorta nudge forwards towards me a few times, and the CEVs were quite cool during the beginning of the trip, but not the 'visions' I wanted. I definitely attribute this in part to throwing up so early, but I don't think it would have been much more intense.<BR>
<BR>
The trip lasted until around 10:30 or so and the after-effects were quite nice. My mind felt more free than any other psychedelic I have tried, and I felt moments of brilliance that I could not remember now for the life of me. Waves of intelligence were followed by the realization that I couldn't drive a car or function in any normal sense which seemed humbling. I questioned morals for a long time. While I was 'out there' and my ego was virtually non-existant, I felt free to try on other personalities.  I could see, even if only briefly, that there are so many different outlooks and each one seems to believe it is right. I felt that morals did not apply for a while but I don't remember everything. The body load was quite pleasurable although not nearly as euphoric as earlier, but it was similar to coming down on mushrooms.<BR>
<BR>
Honestly, I am not sure if I will try ayahuasca again. It took a lot of effort to make, none of my friends would try it with me, and there was a lot of nausea involved. Some would say its a small price to pay for wisdom, but it only seems to last as long as the trip does. I think if I do it again I might try it with B. Caapi instead of Syrian Rue because it is supposedly more gentle and slow on the come-up. I think that I would prefer smoking free-base  DMT rather than oral ayahuasca because it has less nausea and is more visual still. I only wish this had lasted longer.<!--   End Body   -->

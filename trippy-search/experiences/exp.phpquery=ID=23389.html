I would like to say that while I was lucky, this is a very potent substance. I do not recommend the intranasal route at all. This route promotes huge visuals and massive loss of coordination. It also caused a head pressure that was horrible and I will go into it later.<BR>
<BR>
It's monday night. I am sitting in the living room, bored out of my mind. I watch a little tv and then at about 8 o'clock, I insufflate about 7.5mg of 5-IT in one nostril and then about another 7.5 in the other. Immediately, my nose felt like it was on fire! This stuff burns like nothing else I've ever snorted (and that includes mace). I went and sat down in my chair waiting for it to kick in.<BR>
<BR>
T+0:10 I feel a horrible wave of nausea pass over me many times and close my eyes, meditating on my stomach. The nausea passes and things start getting weird. I am listening to Infected Mushroom - B.P. Empire and sound goes super techno. Everything sounds like it is coming through the walls and sounds as though it is coming through a bad cell phone connection.<BR>
<BR>
T+0:30 The floor is completely alive with swirling visuals. They are quite random yet completely beat-matched with Infected Mushroom. I freak out when the CD skips back to the first track and get up to check it out. As I am walking towards the stereo, I notice eye balls popping out on the floor staring at me and just kind of laugh. I don't really notice a lot of paranoia. There was definitely some but the whole room was twisting and turning so it was definitely understandable. I stumble over the futon and realize just how impaired my body is.<BR>
<BR>
T+0:35 After carefully crawling, I am back in my chair. My motor control is just about shot and I feel like I've had about 700mg of DXM. Sitting in the chair feels like I am bending and waving with the music when I know I was sitting still. The visuals on the walls began to pop out in the form of tribal patterns like spades and circles with triangles all through them. Very geometric. I close my eyes and for the next 2 hours, I am fully immersed in the beauty of everything. I can feel my energy in everything around me and begin to realize that everything on this planet is beautiful because it comes from nature. Nothing on this planet isn't made from the universe therefore we are still using completely natural things. Just because something is man-made doesn't make it unnatural. We use natural materials to make synthetic new ones but there is always a component of nature somewhere in there.<BR>
<BR>
I comtemplate this for a long time. This is definitely a ++++ on the Shulgin Scale. I have lost most of my sense of ego. Reality seems to be something that I can change with just a thought. Nothing is static, everything is random. Everything in the universe can be changed by the energy of humanity and when used properly, this energy can be the greatest thing to ever happen to us. We become completely full-spirited and free. Human essence is just like the essence of the universe. We are beings of energy. We are beings of light.<BR>
<BR>
T+2:40 Its shower time. I feel completely dirty but I am strangely filled with this glowing energy. I put the energy away and decide to bring it out later. The shower was wonderful! Taking a shower on this takes a lot of concentration and patience but it is totally cathartic. As soon as the hot water touched me, I became aware of the visuals becoming extremely colorful. Everywhere I looked, there were colorful outlines on the visuals. It felt like total ecstacy! I was in heaven and there was no greater feeling that I could acknowledge than this.<BR>
<BR>
T+3:45 Time to get out of the shower. Man that was a LONG shower. Just as I expected, when I got out of the shower, the visuals went back down to normal. Then the diarrhea hits. It seems as though every bodily function is totally cathartic with this drug. As soon as I started to release, the room turned into a pool... not literally, everything just got extremely wavy and this lasted for the rest of the trip. Breathing walls is an understatement here... they looked as though they were bouncing with the music. I enjoyed this experience for awhile and just relaxed, watching the visuals and thinking wonderful thoughts.<BR>
<BR>
T+6:00 I was entertained by the visuals a lot longer than I expected. I begin to feel a pressure on the left side of my head and decide to take my blood pressure and pulse. Pulse 86, BP 132/84. Hmm, doesn't seem that dangerous... Wait, my Pulse is normally 74 when I'm resting and my BP is usually about 112/73....! This stuff really raised my BP, I'd better be careful. Well, I guess maybe I should eat something. Oranges are always good with 5-MeO-AMT and they could probably help my blood pressure back down. I began to eat an orange and totally forgot that oranges extremely exaggerate the trip.<BR>
<BR>
T+7:00 Just when I thought I was coming down, I shoot back up. I realize, with horror, that it was the orange that caused this. I begin to lose sense of myself again and the paranoia sets in. I begin to realize that I've fucked up and that I can't keep doing this to my body. I was looking for a replacement for AMT now that the DEA scheduled it. I finally realize that nothing can replace AMT and that it is a sign that I need to quit chems and go to the natural tryptamines instead. The thought of taking a trazadone pops into my mind and so I take 50mg of Trazadone.<BR>
<BR>
T+7:30 I am super tired now and the trazadone is making my trip a lot scarier. This is definitely a much more powerful stimulant than AMT. It is overpowering the Trazadone and combining horribly with it (as AMT and 5-MeO-AMT seem to not like any other chems, including pot and each other).<BR>
<BR>
T+8:00 Finally I can go to sleep. Hallucinating while sleeping is not fun. I had nightmares that the Amazons were coming to cut my head off for messing with a man-made chemical instead of trusting nature...!<BR>
<BR>
I woke up this morning and smashed the bottle of 5-MeO-AMT. I do not plan on ever touching this substance again and I have no choice but to work on getting a license for AMT. It was the only thing I've ever found that worked on my depression and AMT saved my life. This chemical almost took it.<BR>
<BR>
NOTE: DO NOT SNORT THIS CHEMICAL! IT BURNS, TASTES HORRID, AND CAN REALLY INCREASE YOUR HEART RATE!<!--   End Body   -->

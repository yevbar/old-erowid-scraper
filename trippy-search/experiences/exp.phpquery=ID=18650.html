I had a couple of experiences with orally administered 5-MeO-DIPT after I procured some from a friend.  I was ready to place this substance aside because of the high ratio of undesirable side effects to positive effects, but I decided that I should give it a chance with an MAOI before letting the remainder atrophy.  <BR>
<BR>
On the night after my birthday, I placed 8 mg of 5-MeO-DIPT into each of three glasses of water, and obtained three pills of the MAOI moclobemide, which is a mostly MAO-A specific inhibitor.  While it does cause some inhibition of the MAO-B enzyme in the body, the ratio of MAO-A to MAO-B inhibition for moclobemide makes it safer and more versatile than other MAO inhibitors.  Unfortunately, one of my companions, J, is taking the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Prozac, and could not partake in this experiment fully.  MAO inhibitors are unsafe to use in conjunction with SSRIs, and could cause the life-threatening serotonin syndrome.  The other companion, K, nearly prevented himself from participating by taking a dose of Dexedrine an hour and a half before we began.  Fortunately, he told me of this and some finger-throat action purged him of the amphetamine before it could be digested.  I am unaware whether amphetamines are affected by MAO-A or MAO-B, but we didn�t want to take additional risks.<BR>
<BR>
At T=9:30 PM, I took 225 mg moclobemide (one and a half pills of Manerix), and waited for K to arrive.  At T+0:30, J and I took 8 mg of 5-MeO-DIPT, and at T+1:00, K arrived.  When K arrived, he took 225 mg moclobemide and 8 mg 5-MeO-DIPT at the same time.  I was already experiencing a rapid and tense come-up at this point. At T+0:50, I had already noticed some minor visual disturbances, and was experiencing mild tension in my jaw.    By T+1:30, everyone was at least beginning to feel the effects of the drug, but to varying degrees.  J and I were at about the same point, despite his abstinence from the MAOI, so we decided to smoke some marijuana, in order to �get into the same headspace.�  We didn�t finish the rather large joint because we agreed that we might still be in for a surprise from the 5-MeO-DIPT.  I felt strongly as though we hadn�t yet seen the nature of what was to come.<BR>
<BR>
We relaxed and spent some time on the computers until T+2:00.  While I have previously peaked on 5-MeO-DIPT around T+1:15, the effects continued to intensify beyond this point.  The psychological effects were becoming very strong, and abstract thinking was becoming very natural.  Most importantly, no more negative gastrointestinal effects were felt than those at an 8 mg dose normally.  Unfortunately, the muscle tension was fairly strong.  At T+2:30, I asked K whether he noted any change, and he said that he felt the effects continuing to intensify.  Soon afterwards I took 0.5 mg alprazolam (the benzodiazepine Xanax) to reduce tension.  I was apprehensive to throw another substance into the mixture, but it went a long way to reducing muscle tension.  I attempted some 4-7-8 pranayama breathwork (a yoga relaxation technique recommended by Dr. Andrew Weil) from T+3:00 to T+4:00, and by T+4:00, I was no longer bothered by any physical effects.<BR>
<BR>
From T+2:30 to T+4:00, the mental effects had continued to build for me, and I began to analyze aspects of my life which had been troubling me.  I am an engineering student, and I have not been achieving the grades that I should be right now.  I reflected on various aspects of my life and made many insights that I had missed over the last year.   I realized that while I have been limiting the frequency of my experimentation with drugs and trying to spend less time learning about their effects, I have been focusing on them and thinking of them a great deal.<BR>
<BR>
I also questioned the insecurity I feel regarding my drug use and my girlfriend's reaction to my recent revelations regarding drug use.  I came to the conclusion that I was in denial of my drug use.  It's not excessive, but I have used drugs a lot.  Drugs have become a time-consuming hobby, even though I don't spend anywhere near most of my time actually using them.  Believing that I am going to change my ways is deluded thinking, until I believe I have a good reason to change, though.<BR>
<BR>
As far as my girlfriend is concerned, I failed to explain to her the scope of my interest and experiences with mind altering drugs.  Why?  I never took the time to understand her viewpoint.  I paradoxically put more at risk by concealing a part of who I am to her than I would have by being honest.  It's not that I can't change, or won't change.  I simply have never had motivation to stop.  Once I know what I want, the rest will follow.  After all, nothing can be easier than doing what you know you want to do.<BR>
<BR>
The nature of this drug is surprisingly introspective, especially considering its reputation as a party drug.  The only thing that kept me from spending the whole evening on a couch or in bed was the physical stimulation.  The mental effects were subjectively similar to those of 5-MeO-DIPT without a MAOI, but much stronger.  Because doses of this drug are usually limited by the physical side effects, I wonder if I've really been seeing the true nature of this drug before.   I actually feel as though my mind was clearer during this experience than in past ones.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps marijuana was overpowering the 5-MeO-DIPT before.  I note now that by the time that the marijuana would have worn off, I was most lucid and found the mental effects most pronounced.  Talking with J and K was fairly easy, although I made efforts to spend a good deal of time alone through the evening.  K too had a strong and moving self-analysis that he feels was positive.<BR>
<BR>
Once K reached his peak, around T+5:00, I convinced the others to go for a walk.  This helped reduce residual tension, and we relaxed.  The work aspect of the trip was finished, and we were ready to simply enjoy the experience.  We smoked the rest of the joint we'd started earlier and admired the night sky.  The northern lights were very intense and the stars were stunningly beautiful.  The visual effects of this combination are somewhat stronger than those of 5-MeO-DIPT alone.  Eventually we grew cold, and hurried back.<BR>
<BR>
At T+7:00, we each ate a .5 mg xanax pill to prepare for sleep and discussed the insights we'd made.  We smoked some more marijuana and J and K talked while I rested.  The effects rapidly subsided T+6:00 between T+7:00, and at T+7:30, we went to sleep.  Probably due to the xanax, we slept restfully for nine hours.  The next day I felt extremely positive, and started to work out how I am going to improve things.  Life is good.<!--   End Body   -->

Several friends and I had planned on tripping after classes on Friday, and since none of us got out of class later than 3, we all decided to dose at around 2:30 and then meet up.<br>
<br>
2:45 - I was in a good state of mind.  This was only my second time tripping, and although my first time was a little weird, I felt that this was going to be different.  It was a beautiful day out - sunny, about 75 degrees, Friday.  I took my one and a half hits and went back to my dorm.<br>
<br>
4:00 - I was starting to feel the effects, so I went to meet my friends.  We walked the short distance to the city park to take in the scenery.  I was also feeling a little edgy, and decided that it would be a good idea to smoke a bit when we got there to settle into the trip.<br>
<br>
4:30 - We get to the park and find an amazing spot to smoke - right at the top of a lake that ran down a bed of rocks, hidden away in about fifty yards of trees.  After smoking, we were all feeling really good about our trips, and we went to the grass to lie down and chill for a bit.  Everything was shifting - especially the clouds.  They were huge, perfectly white, billowy clouds, and there were shifting fractal patterns extending from the edges of them.  We were all lost in our own little worlds, watching the grass grow (it really was!) or whatever images our minds decided to project onto the backs of our closed eyelids.  Everything was going great - much better than my first experience with LSD.<br>
<br>
5:30 - Four of us (out of eight) split off and started to smoke more.  They thought that they had picked out a great spot, but they were really just fourty feet or so away from a major road.  After a cop drives by twice we decide that it's a good time to head back to campus.<br>
<br>
5:45 - Everything is still going strong, and four of us walk around campus on our own, talking about everything that we're thinking about and seeing.  All is well in the world for the next several hours.<br>
<br>
7:30 - Still peaking, but it's getting a little edgy as the skies turn dark.  We decide to smoke.  We headed behind one of the dorms to one of the better known smoking spots on campus, and just as we start a cop walks around one end of the building.  Two of the four of us run, J and I stayed there and got taken into the campus police station (side note - these are real police, not rent-a-cops or anything).<br>
<br>
7:45 - By this time they had tracked down the 2 of us who had ran, and the four of us are sitting in a police station getting interrogated.  They thought that there was something up since two of had ran.  They were right - J and I had leftover blotter in our rooms.  The school has the right to search our rooms whenever they want, and J and I both had our stuff in places where it would have been found.  We were still tripping hard, but we knew that we had to make sure they didn't check our rooms<br>
<br>
Conclusion - We were in the station for two hours.  Through all of their questions, all of the mugshots, all the searching, and all the evil I could see in this officer's face, neither J nor I said one word.  The other two were fumbling over what they were trying to say, and they both ended up having their rooms searched.  Because J an I were silent, we think that the cops thought that we were followers - just along for a smoke out of peer pressure or some crap like that.  Earlier in the interogation the cops had said they were going to search all of our rooms, but they didn't.  The key to dealing with police is to STAY QUIET.  The more you talk, the more potential slip-ups you're going to make.<br>
<br>
My school is trying to rebuild a reputation shattered by alcohol and drug abuse, and there is no doubt in our minds that had they found the LSD they would have written an official police report.  Instead, they let our school's judicial administrator deal with us.  <br>
<br>
The experience in the station was a horrible one.  I was freezing cold the whole time, and I was in a very, very bad mental state.  I was overwhelmed with feelings of anger and hatred because I was being arrested for something which I felt was not even close to a crime.  Since then I go through paranoid episodes if I see police when I'm doing ANYTHING I know I could be written up for.  Whether it's smoking pot, speeding, or even J-walking, it happens.  I just wanted to post this in hopes that it can help guide people in the decisions they will make or the experiences they have gone through.<!--   End Body   -->

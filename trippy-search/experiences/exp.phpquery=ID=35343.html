I hadn't had much time off work lately, so scheduling this trip wasn't easy. I had a Tuesday off, and decided to do it Monday night after work. However, work exhausted me, so Tuesday it was. I spent the day reading the end of 'The Servants of Twilight' by Dean Koontz (I didn't want to keep wondering about it while tripping!), playing guitar, and checking some cds out from the library. I went to a friend's house at 7:30 P.M., watched them play video games; and then played guitar. They were smoking marijuana, but I did not. However, I couldn't not help inhaling some of the smoke. I certainly did not get enough to have much of an effect, but it may have had some effect on my trip. I ate one piece of pizza at around 9:30 P.M. I went home at 11:00 P.M., stopping at the grocery store for grapefruit juice. Got home around 11:30 P.M., and asked the I Ching what substance to ingest. It was either to be 2C-E or DiPT, and I was favoring DiPT (simply because it wasn't as intense/longlasting, and I was tired). I have tried a small dose of 2C-E once, and it didn't do much. That was before I got a scale, and I estimated it to be 6 milligrams. I've also tried DiPT twice before. <br>
<br>
The I Ching read 48 The Well, changing to 32 Steadfastness (with a line reading 'befits a ritual occasion'). The Well began with a T (Two C - E), so it was decided. I measured out 10 milligrams on the scale, and swallowed it in grapefruit juice. I did not taste it at all, which was probably a blessing. After writing my dose and time in my trip notebook, I went on a short walk down the street. Nothing eventful happened, I felt a slight increase in perception, but nothing much. I got home, and at 12:17 A.M., I wrote 'Fairly sure it's starting'. 10 minutes later, listening to American Indian music (which was very beautiful), I remembered these feelings that almost always come up at the beginning of trips. They are indescribable, like something from when I was younger. I realized I need to be more in touch with my emotions, all the time.<br>
<br>
I did some stretching, and at 12:42 A.M., I saw my pupils were dilated. At this time, I noticed maybe the most disturbing aspect of the trip: my sinuses were very dried up and I felt congestion in my throat. This continued throughout the trip, and while I know being around the marijuana smoke beforehand had something to do with it, I also think 2C-E might have had some direct action on my sinuses. I don't want to scare anyone, maybe it was nothing and maybe it was an allergic reaction. It never once became dangerous, although in my paranoid state, I thought it might be. I felt a little nausea at times, but nothing that was a problem.<br>
<br>
1:03 A.M.: I was clenching my teeth some, and felt lots of warmth. It was all smooth though, very unlike 4-HO-DiPT (which comes on, for me, in 5 minutes and is like getting sucked UP a mountainside). <br>
<br>
1:19 A.M.: It is Happening. I can choose to let go and flow with it, or remain clear-headed. I was scared of the congestion at this point. So much was going on. I had open-eye visuals, staring at the ceiling and walls. The ceiling would wave, and once it transformed into what looked like candy. The wooden walls were melting, exactly like what 4-HO-DiPT did to me. But these visuals were not overwhelming or even constant. They only happened when I focused for a couple seconds. My theory is that these 'visuals' are the result of an intense mental concentration, which while sober is very difficult to achieve. Even while sober, I see similar waves in the ceiling if I focus (while meditating), but nothing like the wooden walls melting/changing. <br>
<br>
The first serious thing that happened was, I was staring at the light fixture on my ceiling, and it transformed (not physically, mentally) into SOMETHING, and my entire being felt threatened. Like everything I ever was, could change at this second. Stuff like this is why I take psychedelics, but at the same time, it's not something I can just casually say 'Okay, I'm dying. Cool' to. Sometimes, it is a struggle. <br>
<br>
At 1:50 A.M., I wrote 'Any more than this, I would cease to exist.' I was resisting ego death, but it was happening all around me. I knew that if I had taken 2 more milligrams, the trip would have been too much to handle at this time. I hadn't even prepared for this. I was scared I would never ever snap out of this trip. It was that intense.  I was listening to an Acid Mothers Temple bootleg, and then Larry Coryell. I put on 'Salvial' by Tool, and turned out the lights for 'Third Eye'. I could see energy floating in the darkness, but I wasn't frightened of the dark. But I was scared, just of anything. I had to force myself to lie there and listen. When Maynard screamed, I saw an owl, and a hawk, like another place and time. That song was truly mindblowing, 'So good to see you, I missed you so much'. The 'Prying open my third eye' part sent waves of color pounding through my head, and it is vivid even now. <br>
<br>
I won't bother trying to recall other details. At 2:56 A.M., I finally felt like I was going to live (which meant I might be coming down). A little later, I watched 'Star Wars' and ate some frozen strawberries. They did not upset my stomach. I went to sleep in between 4:45 A.M. and 5:00 A.M., and did not have a problem falling asleep (5 hours after ingestion). The intense effects were mostly gone at that point. I woke at 9:30 A.M. because of the phone, and had to watch 'The Empire Strikes Back' to help me fall back asleep. I went to work later that day, at 6:00 P.M., and had no problems. <br>
<br>
Others have compared 2C-E to LSD, and while I have never taken it, I have ingested morning glory seeds. I would say 2C-E is somewhat like morning glories, but not as friendly. For me, it was a teacher and not a friend. It was not afraid to rip my mind apart and show me the pieces. I would encourage taking care with the dose, as 10 milligrams had a PROFOUND effect on me. Nothing I couldn't safely handle by myself, but it was pretty crazy.<!--   End Body   -->

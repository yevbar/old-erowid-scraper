I had my first blast when I was 38 years young and had never used anything other than pot before.<br>
<br>
At first it was big fun of course, but it didn't take long for that to wear off. Within four or five blasts, I was hooked.<br>
<br>
After four months I'd become an identifiable junkie. I was staggeringly thin, and people stared at me. <br>
<br>
I quickly lost concentration in anything other than getting from one dose to the next. Within a few months of my first blast, my life began to fall apart: relationships, study/work, friends, self-esteem, body image, my mental health deteriorated. I became a very unpleasant person and everything felt like a huge effort.<br>
<br>
Acquiring a needle fetish wasn't good for me. I was mesmerized by the needle, more so than the meth which soon became a terrible terrible burden. <br>
<br>
The day I couldn't get out of bed without a shot was the day I began to bring myself back to reality. I'd been using continuously for seven months at this stage. I reduced my doses and began to shoot up sterile water when the needle cravings peaked. I got a lot of assistance from the staff at the local detox clinic. They were friendly and understanding.<br>
<br>
After about a month of procrastination, I finally took the plunge. My dealer (yeah can you believe that) agreed to support me. At home, I just sat and stared for hours and hours, retching my guts up quite often, and after three days I was clean. And never looked back. In the meantime I had lost everything, and hurt my family and friends. Now, at least, I have my soul. <br>
<br>
The first few months were hardest because I had to break association with other users and the whole culture of it. I moved out of state, which was a successful tactic. Cravings weren't much of an issue surprisingly !<br>
<br>
Two years later, I've stopped having dreams about it, and I look back on this as a special kind of learning experience.<!--   End Body   -->

Experience – First time<BR>
Setting – my basement<BR>
<BR>
I have been interested in the 2C compounds for awhile now. My first experience with 2C-I was almost perfect. I felt I needed to explore these chemicals a little more, rather than limit myself to one.<BR>
<BR>
For the evening I was trying to decide on 2C-T-2 or 2C-C. I was debating whether I should go with something I’ve wanted to try for awhile, or go with something new and be adventurous. I opted to go with the 2C-T-2 as it had been on my “to do” list longer.<BR>
<BR>
I had heard of the horrible nausea that had been associated with 2C-T-2 so I decided to mix my dose into a drink, and sip it over 30 minutes. I poured myself a tall glass of juice and sprinkled 14mg of 2C-T-2 into it. I lit some incense and prepared to drink.<BR>
<BR>
11:10 PM – I sip my 2C-T-2 cocktail. There is no taste other than the juice. I am pleased as I did not want a chemical flavored beverage.<BR>
<BR>
11:30 PM – I’m still sipping my drink. I am almost ¾ done with it. I feel a bit light headed. There is no nausea to speak off. I had a garbage bag nearby in case I needed to throw up, but I could tell it wasn’t going to be a problem.<BR>
<BR>
11:38 PM – I finish my drink. I have a mild body high now. It feels a lot like how I remember 2C-I feeling. My mind seems to be drifting off.<BR>
<BR>
12:00 AM – My depth perception is definitely altered. I am at my computer and it seems much farther away from me than it did a few minutes ago. I reach out for it and my arm seems to extend forever until it makes contact. Quite interesting.<BR>
<BR>
12:05 AM – I notice a bit of a headache. This feels much like the 2C-I headaches I usually get. I have not read of 2C-T-2 giving headaches, but I just dismiss it as something that I will have to deal with. I also notice some objects are taking on a breathing effect. The room seems to be coming alive now. <BR>
<BR>
12:08 AM – There is a light directly above me. It feels so warm. I makes me quite happy and I feel very comfortable.<BR>
<BR>
12:20 AM – Body buzz is getting stronger. I also notice a splash of color on the walls. It looked like someone splashed red paint, and then it faded away. It was quite nice to see. I call my girlfriend R as she had been out for the night, and wanted to hear from me. Talking to her increased my mood even more.<BR>
<BR>
12:35 AM – Strong patterning has appeared. Very colorful images are sliding across the carpet. I try to describe them to R but I can say is they are beautiful. She laughs. I have no problem talking to her while tripping, as she knows how incoherent I can become. And because I know she is aware of this, I feel no shame. <BR>
<BR>
1:00 AM – I hang up with R. I am still completely in awe of the patterning I’m seeing. The body buzz is still there but actually seems weaker. Could it be I have passed the peak in less than 2 hours?<BR>
<BR>
1:30 AM – The patterning stops. This surprises me as the hallucinations I was having were so vivid and now they are gone. The breathing of objects seems to have diminished as well.<BR>
<BR>
2:00 AM – All visuals are gone. The body buzz is mild at best. My mind feels completely sober. I am extremely confused by this. I had read the duration of 2C-T-2 was roughly 6-8 hours. It was almost 3 hours since I started ingesting it and I felt sober. Perhaps this comes in waves I thought. I decided to just wait, and that it would all come back to me.<BR>
<BR>
3:00 AM – Nothing. I still feel sober. But I feel stimulated. I am rather disappointed the results here. I try to go to sleep, but it does not work. I feel like I’ve had way too much caffeine. I take 10mg of Valium.<BR>
<BR>
3:30 AM – The valium has knocked me out, and I am done for the night.<BR>
<BR>
-------------------------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
I don’t know exactly what to think here. I was really disappointed with how short it was. I don’t understand why this happened. Perhaps my body metabolizes 2C-T-2 very quickly. Also, it could have been my dose was weak; a mere 14mg. Also, drinking over the 30 minutes could have made a difference.<BR>
<BR>
The results of this could have been a combination of things. I guess I’ll need to try this again. I think next time I will take a higher dose (16-18mg) and I’ll take it all at once, and just try to deal with the nausea that may come.<BR>
<BR>
The effects of this drug were quite pleasant for awhile. It was just a shame to have them all end so fast…<!--   End Body   -->

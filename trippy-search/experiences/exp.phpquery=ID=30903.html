I was taking an organic chemistry class at the university. We had one lab experiment involving grignard reactions. Anyways, the reaction required the use of 99.5% pure A.C.S. grade anhydrous diethyl ether. I managed to take home about two 300mL vials of this nice anesthetic. Me and my roommate started huffing. <br>
<br>
What we did was just open the vial put a paper towel folded in fourths on it and turn it over to saturate a small circle in the center of the towel. We would then exhale sharply, hold the paper towel over our mouths and inhale deeply and hold for as long as possible.<br>
<br>
The first thing I notice about ether is that it smells really bad... and it feels cold and 'chemically' when it hits my lungs. It smells like turpentine or gasoline. After we inhaled a few times from the paper towel we noticed effects akin to nitrous oxide. All we got were some 'wah-wah' sounds and a slight loss of coordination. No spectatular hallucinations or dreams, more like a generalized numbing of the mind and senses. Maybe we've done nitrous too many times to really feel psychedelic from ether or maybe we were doing it wrong... Anyhow, I tried huffing for every breath until my entire jar was gone (about 25 consecutive breaths of turpentine nastyness) and felt nothing more than I would from two whippets of nitrous oxide. <br>
<br>
The worst part about ether is 'ether breath' for 12-24 hours after I finish doing ether, my breath and mouth reek of ETHER. My girlfriend described it as gasoline breath and it was unbearable for her to kiss me :( I brushed my teeth, gargled, chewed multiple pieces of gum and ate altoids and couldn't disguise that horrible smell coming out of my mouth for the ENTIRE next day! In the movie 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' they go into a casino and they let them in... I would bet that if me and my roommate tried stumbling into Circus Circus with our reek-ass ether breath they would've detained us and called an ambulance because we would look all fucked up and smell like we'd been drinking gasoline all night.<br>
<br>
My suggestion to anyone who wants to get messed up, do nitrous instead. For those people who want to do it to check it off their list of 'cool' exotic drugs that they have done, be my guest but be prepared for nothing spectacular and a horrible aftertaste that just lingers on.<!--   End Body   -->

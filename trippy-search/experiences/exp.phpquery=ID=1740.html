    I recently acquired some salvia and tried it with great dissapointment. I thought that it was a waste of my money and said to myself that it was just not going to work on me. A week went by and I had a dream that this female spirit of some sort would help me find the salvia path of enlightenment. I dismissed this dream as just another dream, and didn't try salvia for atleast a day. I thought to myself that maybe the first couple of times I tried salvia I had rushed into it or something. <BR>
<BR>
    I got a gentle rain cd with back up music on it and popped it into my cd player and listened to it with some head phones. I made sure just a night light was all the light entering the room. I slowly lit my waterpipe and drew in a small inhalation and felt nothing. I thought to myself that was going to get the same results as last time. I continued to smoke the salvia and thought to myself that it wasn't going to work at all, when suddenly I lost contact with my body, but was still aware that I was smoking the salvia. I had one more hit to take and thought to myself that this hit would put me to were I wanted to be in this different world. I struggled to take the remaining inhalation----I closed my eyes when I finally got it in my lungs and held it there as long as possible.<BR>
<BR>
    The rain seemed intense on the headphones with occasional thunder. I slowly opened my eyes and didn't recognize were I was, I looked around at this place I had some how stumbled into or something. In this place I was old or so I felt I was and I was on this porch rocking on a rocking chair with my waterpipe in my lap watching the rain and smelling the cool breeze it was picking up from within this forest I could see from the porch. I don't remember anything about real reality, I could only remember what had happened in this different reality, almost as if I never exsisted before and this was really the place I was, on this porch. I felt calm and very relaxed and I wondered what I was going to fix for dinner inside. I saw the inside through this old persons thoughts as if you were thinking about your own kitchen. <BR>
<BR>
    I then coughed or something in my physical body and switched to somewhere else in a different reality with the sound of rain and thunder. I felt a presence beside me and looked over and saw a woman that was very old and very beautiful and was talking to me in whispers but wasn't moving her lips. I talked back to her but can not remember what was said except for one thing she told me. 'Let go of your thoughts, relax,' she wispered telepathically somehow to me. This all felt normal and in no way did I think during this expierence that I was dreaming or fucked up on salvia...I couldn't tell the difference between these visions from the real world. I even felt the rain from this place run down my forehead and face. <BR>
<BR>
    I remember this old woman walking off into the rain down a path in forest full of plants and and trees that reached to the heavens and the sound and smells were so vibrant and full. As soon as she became engulfed in the vegetation along the trail I felt an electric jolt of some sort and slowly began to realize my surroundings once again in my house and the headphones on my head with the sound of rain and a flute. I looked around and everthing seemed the way it was before. I wasn't sure though if this was the real place my physical body was or if this was in my mind. I felt very puzzled and had to stand up and touch somethings to make sure I was really in the physical world once again. I thought to myself that I never have had to think like this after a trip or wonder if I was actually down to earth or not. I finally realized that I was here in the physical and that all that had happened was due to the salvia.<BR>
<BR>
    I had never expierenced anything so intense and so real from a chemical. It was totally dissociating and very real. I now reallize why some people freak out on this stuff. I do believe this plant should be left alone to those wanting an easy trip with cool visuals and cool patterns. This plant is more than one could imagine if it will let you step through the door into salvia consciousness. The awareness it gave me will never be forgotten. The expierence I had while smoke salvia was nothing like I had thought it would be nor was I at all prepared for this visit to these worlds. Please don't use this plant as an acid substitute because it is nothing like that and could really mess with you mind if you are not expierenced with psychedelics.<!--   End Body   -->

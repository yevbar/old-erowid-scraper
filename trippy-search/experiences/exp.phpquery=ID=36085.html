Be forewarned that I have a fairly high opiate tolerance; I commonly take 25mg of hydrocodone at a time.  That said, here are my first few experiences with poppy seed extractions.<br>
<br>
|| Poppy seeds, oral, 400g ||<br>
<br>
To extract the goodies from the seeds, I poured 400g poppy seeds into a Pyrex bowl and added enough lemon juice to make a thick soup.  I let it sit for 30 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes.  I then strained out the lemon juice into a cup, then rinsed the seeds several times with water, each time straining the liquid into the cup.  I ended up with 18 ounces of light brown, very sour liquid.  I mixed in a tbsp of honey and some apple juice to make the mess easier to drink.<br>
<br>
[5:30pm]  Drank the liquid.  It tastes basically like lemonade.<br>
<br>
[6:00]  I feel a bit nauseous, but nothing I can’t handle.  I also feel a little light-headed, but this may or may not be due to the seeds.<br>
<br>
[6:15]  I am beginning to feel a standard opiate euphoric buzz.<br>
<br>
[6:30]  The buzz is growing quickly.  I now feel as if I had taken approx 10mg hydrocodone.<br>
<br>
[10:30]  The buzz has been pretty much constant up to this point, but I have been getting some pretty powerful waves over the last few minutes.  I have been battling slight intermittent nausea the whole time, but nothing too bad.<br>
<br>
[12:00]  The euphoria is beginning to subside.<br>
<br>
[1:00am]  Baseline.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
|| Poppy seeds, oral, 1lb (454g) ||<br>
<br>
This time I decided to do the extraction a little differently.  First I mixed in the entire pound of seeds with 5oz lemon juice and water to the top of the seeds.  I let it sit for an hour this time, stirring twice.  After rinsing and straining a few times, I ended up with 20oz of yellow-brown fluid.<br>
<br>
[7:00pm]  Chugged the whole mess.<br>
<br>
[8:00]  First hints of an opiate buzz.<br>
<br>
[8:45]  Definite euphoria, like maybe 10mg of hydrocodone.  No nausea this time.<br>
<br>
[9:30]  This is noticeably stronger than last time, more than would be accounted for by the additional 54g of seed; my guess is that either soaking longer helped a lot or these seeds were stronger.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
|| Poppy seeds, smoked ||<br>
<br>
I decided to try and smoke an extraction.  I used the same extraction method as last time with an entire pound, except with only 1.5oz lemon juice to keep the excess material in the extraction to a minimum.  I then poured the liquid into a pan and baked it on 300 degrees for around 2 hours.  A razor blade paint scraper served very well to get the gunk off the pan and into a pipe.  I put half of it into a pipe, and smoked roughly half the bowl (the extraction from a quarter pound of seed).  My head immediately felt inflated like a beach ball, my face felt very hot and flushed, and I felt very euphoric.  However, I tried smoking more of the extract on two separate occasions and it didn’t work either time.  Which is to say, I don’t know if smoking the extract works or not.<!--   End Body   -->

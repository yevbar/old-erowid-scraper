I have done LSD and MDMA more times than I can remember and have never had a bad experience with either. Oh, and my mind is still here. I'm a junior in medical technology and was a meteorologist for four years. I am a naturally happy guy, so thats how my trips, rolls, and trollings go. I will injest 7 (lucky 7 for the first time) HBWR seeds partially crushed soaked in CoolAid for app. 30 min.<br>
<br>
5:30 p.m. Ate four hours ago at Mickey D's. Will use smokes and herbs for possible nausea or other problems. 1 min till injestion and I'm off. That 70's show is starting so I should have some good laughs prior to impact of anything. Always a good thing. I also have a dog. Pets are the best when tripping. Always make me happy. All seven are down. Chewed them up good and washed down with more coolaid. Getting glass pipe and bowl ready with legal herbs. Going with Vision Quest herbal smoke. 3/4 pack of cigs, all set.<br>
<br>
6:00 p.m. Nothing much yet. Still way too soon. Most things take around 1 hr to fully start kicking in for me so I'm good. No nausea or any problems like that yet. Feels like something is coming on, but still not for sure. Would also like to say its been over two years since I have done XTC or acid. So don't remember some of the feelings. But, an upset stomach usually meant some good stuff. Still not upset much at all. Think I'm starting to feel some effects. A little faster than expected. May just be excitement of trying the first time still. <br>
<br>
6:30 p.m. Definitely feeling the body high. No signs of puking or wanting to. Just the average stomach saying get ready for this. May skip a few hours or something if I get caught up with something else. But, generally a very good comfortable feeling right now. Similar to coming up on XTC. This stuff seems to be really good. No sickness or anything. Great body high right now. Gonna start some incents and will check back soon. I'm gonna grow some of these. They seem great. I'm walking really slow, so I know this is some good stuff. <br>
<br>
7:10 p.m. Wow, this stuff is good. All body right now. Almost identical to XTC. Decided to watch Dazed and Confused for the music and stuff. Great choice with my surround sound. Not once did I feel like throwing up or anything like that. Starting to feel somewhat incitefull like if on acid. But, not going to say anything like that yet. We will see where it leads. Mind is starting to work faster than fingers. That's always a good thing. Wow, body feels like jello. Walking is just a blast. Very slow, drawn out walks are the best feeling. Got my Pink Floyd Cd's lade out and ready once movie ends. If I can wait that long:)<br>
<br>
7:30 p.m. Having to type slow here. Walking around the house is awsome. Still no visuals. Looked in mirror and pupals dialated. Believe me, if I had visuals, I would still be at the mirror. That was the coolest thing with acid. But, this is awsome for legal. Very awsome. Going to try some herb and see if that helps anything. This is great stuff alone. Damn. Damn. What can I say but, Damn! Everything I pick up feels weightless. But, throwing is chore let me tell ya. Dog wanted to play fetch and tug of war, didn't happen LOL. Smoking some Vision Quest herb was great. Great taste and aroma, much better than cigs. Although all drugs require cigs to get the good effects in my opinion. Wow, what I would do for a full body message. That would be ecstacy! Music is great at this point. This is becoming a long report. Maybe I should just right a book on this. Just joking LOL.<br>
<br>
8:11 p.m. This will be the last update for awhile. I'm just going to truly enjoy this great feeling. Queen is a great choice of music right now. Music is very enhanced. I know its louder than I think right now. But the vibes are great. A truly wonderful natural high. This is almost like trolling (mixing LSD and MDMA). Still no amazing visuals. But, I feel this is only the beginning of something great. <br>
<br>
9:15 p.m. This stuff is great. Pretty good trailers, and visuals seem to be really starting to increase. Overall the body high almost identical to acid. Music and sounds are truly enhanced. Even more amazing, my dog seems to be feeding off my high. Has an unusual amount of energy for this late at night. Very enhanced taste and smell much like acid. I'm not getting that dehydration feel most get. If anything, I feel I don't want anything to drink. Got some gatorade and drank some of it just to give me a little something. Don't want to dehydrate. That would be bad. WOW. this stuff is amazing for being legal. Maybe its just been awhile since I felt this good or something. I'm not for sure. But, WOW!<br>
<br>
Time seems to be standing still. That is so great. Visuals really starting to kick in good. Why does it seem you only post the bad trips. This stuff is great. Now the feeling is almost identical to LSD. Wow, it's been awhile! this is great. I'm so happy I tried this. There is one odd thing. Stomach seems to want food, but I don't. Wierd.<br>
<br>
12:15 Still having a great trip. Installing Tony Hawk 2 to play. We use to play that for hours on the PS1. So this should be fun. This stuff is truly an amazing substance. No hard peek or anything and seem to feel a little drained but still have very much in state of tripping. Very enjoyable and fulfilled with this product. This has to be the closest thing to the real LSD I have ever heard of. During all my days with X and LSD, I don't ever recall hearing about HBWR. Just ran across a few things on the internet looking up MJ substitutes. I feel this is a very underated product. I was not expecting to be tripping this hard this steady at such a great state of mind. Have seen very good visuals. Looked into a light outside while walking the dog and the light stayed with me for about 5 minutes and I could see a green face in the middle of the light that was following me. Very wierd but very very cool. Had a hot pocket to eat and feel very satisfied and no problems what so ever.<br>
<br>
1:30 Starting to come down. Very smooth comedown. May just go lay down. I feel it will be very good to just relax a bit. Probably wont go to sleep right off. But, still feel great so thats fine with me.<br>
<br>
2:00 Went to sleep fine with no problems. Laid down and just relaxed for about 30-45 minutes and then I was out like a light. I have been very impressed with this. Comedown was much smother than X and close to that of LSD but much slower. Very, very impressive product.<!--   End Body   -->

I quit smoking weed about a year and a half ago. I started getting bad grades in college so I decided that pot was interfering with my life. When I stumbled upon Spice on the internet, I was curious to see if it lived up to the hype so I got about 3g of Spice Arctic Synergy (a minty version of the original Spice) off the internet and had it delivered 4 days later. I read that it contained synthetic cannabis-like chemicals, but was legal and did not show up in a drug test, and was eager to try it.<br>
	<br>
On the day the stuff arrived, I separated about a gram into a big joint and decided to go in my car for a smoke session. The herb burns very quickly, and I was almost done with the joint in about 5 minutes. The one thing I didn’t like about Spice is the horrible smell and taste, but that would be my only complaint.<br>
<br>
About 10 minutes in, I started thinking that I had been ripped off and that this stuff was complete bullshit. Until all of a sudden, I start feeling this warmth over my body, creeping  over my back, then my legs start to buzz with energy.  Very intense body high, and I was nothing less than impressed. My depth perception became distorted and I started to stare into nothing for a while. Everything felt very cloudy and it felt like a dream. I was really high for about 2 hours, just completely relaxed and in a trance state, and came down for about another 3 or 4 hours. The effects I got from Spice were almost 100% identical to some good marijuana; I got cottonmouth, red-eyed, time distortion and bad munchies. Music sounded amazing. I was able to fall asleep on it no problem.<br>
<br>
The next day I woke up at around 2PM feeling a little dizzy, like when I get hangover from weed. I felt a little off for the entire day, definitely unmotivated and just tired. Thankfully I had nothing important to do. Overall, I could say that Spice is very strong and could easily be addictive, and will very soon be declared illegal everywhere. I will be smoking it until they decide to stop shipping the product.<!--   End Body   -->

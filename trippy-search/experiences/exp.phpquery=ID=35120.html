I've read quite a bit here on Erowid over the years. A lot of it I've found very informative. My most recent pet project was mimohuasca. So after reading EVERY bit of ino to be found here, I ordered 25 grams of hostilis online, along with 25 grams peganum harmala (syrian rue). 4 days from placing my order, My package came in the mail. Total cost was $29.88 <BR>
<BR>
  I was ready to try it, but what method of extraction would I use? I've read so much about people loading it with lemon juice, limes, etc. coffe grinders, days of soaking.. In other words, long involved work ups. I've also read how Jurema is prepared by the shamans. It doesn't look like they acidfy the hell out of it to me. So here's how I went about it.<BR>
<BR>
  I used scissors to chop the mimosa rootbark (25 grams) into half inch pieces. Then I put this in my blender and squeezed 1 lemon over it. I added about 2 inches of purified water. Put the lid on tightly and turned on the blender at the lowest speed. Once it ws a little more chopped (about 3 minutes) I raised it up to liquify. I left it on this setting for about 8 minutes or so. <BR>
<BR>
  While it was blending I folded 4 grams of syrian rue into a piece of paper so that there was 2 or 3 layers of paper around it, and I proceeded to pound the hell out of it with a hammer until it was powdered.<BR>
<BR>
  I added this powder into a mall sauce pan on my stove with about 2 inches of purified water, and set on high heat.<BR>
<BR>
  Next I poured the blended mimosa and water into another medium sauce pan and also set on high heat. The mimosa was VERY finely chopped. And the blending had kicked up a pink foam. It looked rather like a srawberry milk-shake. <BR>
<BR>
  I let the rue cook violently for about 10 minutes or so, then I poured the mixture through a gold wire mesh coffe filter into an empty container. Added more water to the pan, knocked the rue powder out of the coffe filter back into the pan, and set it to boiling again. I set the filtered liquid aside. When the 2nd boiling was done (about 15 minutes) I again filtered, and poured the combined extracts into a pot and reduced it to 100 milliliters.<BR>
<BR>
  After the mimosa had been boiling for about 15 minutes, I took it off the stove and filtered it through the coffe filter into another container. Set the VERY red liquid aside and knocked the mimosa pulp back into the pan, added an inch or so of water, and set it to boiling again. I did not add any more lemon juice. I repeated this one more time after another ten minutes or so of boiling, for a total of 3 boilings and filterings. The 2nd extraction was much paler. And the 3rd was nearly colorless. All together it only took about 45 minutes to completely extract.<BR>
<BR>
 I then poured the combined mimosa extracts into a pot and boiled it down to 200 milliliters. Altogether, the complete work up of the mimosa and rue took only an hour and a half.<BR>
<BR>
 At T 00:00 I drank the 100 mililiters of <BR>
Syrian Rue extract. The taste was bitter and very unpleasant. Though perhaps not as bad as San pedro extracts I've taken in the past. I added an ice cube to chill it first, and downed it in two sips.<BR>
<BR>
 At T 00:30 I had my first taste of Mimosa. I nly drank 100 milliliters of the 200 I'd prepared, as I've read that 12 grams of material was an adequate first dose. The taste was horrid. I've downed some nasty shit in my time, lol, but THIS stuff is terrible. It only had half a lemon's worth of juice.. But 'tart' doesn't begin to describe it. I had planned on sipping it slowly, but figured the quicker it was over the better, so I swallowed the rest quickly.<BR>
<BR>
  T 01:00 I 'hear/feel' an odd buzzing. I feel somewhat spacey from the rue. I don't feel at all nauseous. I'm thinking maybe people are exagerating on how it's only a matter of time to you vomit with mimosa.<BR>
<BR>
  T 01:25 I'm starting to notice, rather quickly, tht I'm beggining to trip. I feel disconnected, strange. I see patterns wherever I look. The flame on a candle I'd lit earlier has the flame.. an aura of red.. and an aura of blue. I know I'm in. Suddenly it occurs to me that I AM about to vomit. I jump up and rush to the bathroom, and oh GOD!! I feel like I'm heaving up my soul. When I'm done I'm sweating.. but I feel so much better now that I've purged. And I'm just sitting on the floor staring. The white floor is full of colors and shapes.. Distance is completely screwed, lol. I know the toilet is a foot away, but it seems to be on the other side of the room. The suddenly very huge room. <BR>
<BR>
  T 02:00 I wobble and stumble my way back into my living room and stare at the candle for a minute. I cannot describe how beautiful it is to me. I feel a little clenched up. Not grinding my teeth clenched, but it's definitely there. I drink a sip or two of iced tea. Light a cigarette, and sit back in my recliner.<BR>
<BR>
  T 02:30 I'm being bombarded by visuals. Moving so quickly I can't focus on any one. I feel as though I've eaten a rainbow, and it's leaking out through my eyes. My german shephard is sitting along side me staring at me. He always has looked thoughtful to me, but right now I feel like I can 'see' his mind working. I keep asking him if I'm okay. Because I honestly don't know if I am. He chooses not to answer me :D<BR>
<BR>
  T 03:00 It seems to be wearing off, and I feel extremely sleepy. I go upstairs and lie down in my bed. Cover up and fall asleep for awhile. suddenly i'm wide awake. I drink a cup of iced tea, and light a cigarette. The tip is so unbelieveably orange. And it's smearing and tracing all over. Suddenly I have to purge again. The tea was a bad idea. I run to the bathroom and get rid of the tea. Dry heave for a minute, and sit back exhausted. When I walk back to my room, I'm suddenly tripping harder than ever. <BR>
<BR>
  What the hells this? I was just about completely down, now I'm back in outer space? I layed back down, closed my eyes, and went.. Somewhere. I really can't remember where. Except for hearing a voice saying 'Come in, I've been waiting.'<BR>
<BR>
  T 04:00 I'm just about back to normal.. mostly. I eat some strawberry short cake. lay back,and try to get my shit together. I feel beat. But my stomach feels completely fine. <BR>
<BR>
  I think I'll wait awhile before using the other 12.5 gram extract. Maybe I'll cook it down completely and pack it in gel caps. I'd like to find a way to keep this stuff down longer. It was a nice trip, but it could have been more intense if I hadn't yacked it up so soon.<!--   End Body   -->

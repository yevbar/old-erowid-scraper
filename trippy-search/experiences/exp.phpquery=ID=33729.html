For the past two days I have spent the better part of my waking hours on diphenhydramine, and I enjoyed almost every minute of it.  The more I read about its dangers, the more that worries me.<br>
<br>
I had never used diphenhydramine before except as a sleep aid in the recommended dose.  I wasn't using any other drug at the time, except caffeinated soft drinks with meals, and my usual quota of cigarettes.<br>
<br>
What follows is adapted from the notes I took at the time:<br>
<br>
Tuesday<br>
4:00 a.m.<br>
Took 5 Maximum Strength Sominex -- at 50mg diphenhydramine to a caplet, that's 250mg in all.  I may take more in an hour.  I'm going to go out for a smoke.<br>
<br>
4:33<br>
I'm watching a movie on TV.  No noticeable effects yet.<br>
<br>
4:55<br>
Slight loss of balance (I may be imagining it):  I stood up and found myself lurching sideways.<br>
<br>
5:00<br>
I've taken another 250mg.<br>
<br>
5:06<br>
A slight, almost imperceptible sensation of warmth in my abdomen; I also feel definitely light-headed.<br>
<br>
5:40<br>
Light-headedness is more pronounced.  I am only slightly drowsy. The experience so far is comparable to a 1st-plateau DXM trip or a mild drunk.<br>
<br>
5:46<br>
My pulse is normal, but weak.  I feel slightly warm.<br>
<br>
6:04<br>
The drowsiness is delicious.  Only, I keep *almost* falling asleep, then snapping out of it with a start.<br>
<br>
I just heard three computer-like beeps, one long and two short.  I think it is an hallucination; there isn't anything in this room that normally beeps.<br>
<br>
I know I should not by lying down, but I am anyway.  I'm trying not to fall asleep, though.<br>
<br>
My legs feel as though they were about to cramp up.<br>
<br>
6:53<br>
It's getting harder and harder to stay awake.<br>
<br>
My stomach is uncomfortable.  Not painful, and not exactly nauseous, but *uncomfortable*.  The rest of my body feels the same way, though not as bad; still, I can't find a comfortable postion to lie in.<br>
<br>
5:18 p.m.<br>
And sure enough, I let myself sleep -- a long, dead, heavy sleep, but surprisingly refreshing.<br>
<br>
10:15<br>
I'm trying this again:  5 left-over Sominex and 8 store-brand softgels of the same potency, 750mg in all.<br>
<br>
11:16<br>
No noticeable effects yet.<br>
<br>
Wednesday<br>
12:15 a.m.<br>
Still no noticeable effects.  Perhaps I should have taken it on an empty stomach.<br>
<br>
12:38<br>
I'm feeling *something* now -- a kind of wooziness.  I'm going to take one more softgel.<br>
<br>
1:41<br>
I've taken yet another softgel, bringing the total to 750mg. Effects are obvious now, but disappointingly mild.<br>
<br>
1:51<br>
This has been happening for a while:  any sudden noise makes me tense up.  *Any* sudden noise, from the elevator bell to people laughing on TV.<br>
<br>
1:57<br>
I keep hearing little tapping and clicking noises.  I do not know if they are real or not, but they still make me shudder involuntarily.<br>
<br>
2:43<br>
My hands are *light*.  It's rather the same sensation you get when you pick up a cup you think is full, only to jerk it two feet in the air because it was empty, after all.<br>
<br>
4:43<br>
About an hour ago I was sitting, smoking, out in front of the dorm and suddenly I smelled pot.  It was only for a moment, though, and there was nobody around and no apparent source for the smell.<br>
<br>
I decided to walk to the computer lab.  As I was walking, I saw several people standing in the distance.  (It occured to me that they might be the pot smokers.)  As I came closer, they disappeared, leaving only one.  He was standing behind some shrubbery, so I could only see his head and shoulders.<br>
<br>
As I came closer still, the man's head disappeared and in its place there was a white folding chair standing on top of an outdoor table.<br>
<br>
I'm back in my room now.  The effects have largely worn off, though cottonmouth, and a kind of tired feeling in my muscles, persist.<br>
<br>
5:01<br>
One thing I forgot to mention, but probably should:  this stuff has been playing havoc with my memory.  I'd be in the middle of a train of thought, and suddenly my mind would go blank -- leaving me wondering what I had been thinking about only a few seconds before.<br>
<br>
4:18 p.m.<br>
I fell asleep shortly after that last entry, and woke up about half an hour ago. I have 300mg left, which I've decided to go ahead and take.<br>
<br>
5:36<br>
It kicked in while I was eating supper about 15 minutes ago.<br>
<br>
For 'only' 300mg, this is surprisingly strong -- it almost feels stronger than the 750mg last night.  My head and limbs feel light, as they did before, and I have the sensation of something thick and heavy wrapped around the top of my head.<br>
<br>
My memory is going again, too.<br>
<br>
8:23<br>
Effects held steady, neither increasing nor decreasing, until shortly before 8.  Then they tapered off very quickly, and now I feel no more than the slightest intoxication.<br>
<br>
Of course, I frittered the experience away watching TV.  When will I learn?<!--   End Body   -->

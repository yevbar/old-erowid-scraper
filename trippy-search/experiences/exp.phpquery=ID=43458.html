Background info: I am 24 years old and have used numerous drugs in the past. I won't bother to list them all, but my favorites are high-grade marijuana, which I use frequently, and the occassional mushroom trip. I recently graduated from college with the highest honors, earning a bachelor's degree in mathematics. Contrary to most of the reports I've read, my experiences with coke have been mostly positive. Following are descriptions of the two times I have used this powder.<br>
<br>
First time: It was March 2005, during my spring break. I was in a very positive mood and was well rested. I went to my good friend Will's house for a night of kicking back and drinking; I had not seen him for a few months, so I was looking forward to talking with him and catching up on things. After having a couple beers and chatting with him a bit, Will pulls out a 1/2 gram bag of coke($20 worth around here) and begins to chop up some of it. I knew that Will did coke sometimes, and I was curious about the substance, so I told him that I would like to try some if it's okay. I asked him a few questions about it; the most important thing he told me was that if I only do coke very infrequently, on special occasions, then there will be no problems.<br>
<br>
We each had 1/4 of a gram that night, beginning at 11PM and taking small lines and bumps throughout the night while continuing to drink. Snorting the coke was more comfortable than I had imagined, and I felt no pain while doing so. We spent the whole night listening to music and talking. Among other things, we talked about past events, our plans for the future, and our friends and family. We had very open conversations in which we shared with each other past mistakes and lessons learned from them, and what each of us percieved as his personal shortcomings.<br>
<br>
The effects that the coke had on me include increased energy, increased heart rate, increased focus(usually alcohol slows me down mentally; coke counteracted this and then some), loss of social inhibitions, and a lack of fatigue/need for sleep. We finished the coke at around 3:30AM, and I went home at 5AM, having consumed a 12-pack. I felt a body buzz from the alcohol, but my mind felt none of the effects. I could not sleep at home, so I ended up staying awake and going to bed early the next night. No adverse effects followed my indulgence in the snow, and I didn't really think about coke for about two months afterwards.<br>
<br>
Second time: Shortly after my graduation, Will invited me to a get-together that he was planning. He was inviting some longtime friends of ours and was planning to pick up some coke for the gathering. After pondering this for a minute, I told Will that I would be there. The day of the party, I was in excellent spirits; I was excited about seeing my friends, one of whom, Rocky, lives across the country and who I had not seen for over two years. Five of us came to the event. After arriving there, I learned that Will had obtained an 8-ball for $100. Other party favors consisted of a fifth of tequila, two cases of beer, and a small amount of dank that I had. <br>
<br>
At 7PM, we began the night by each taking a couple shots of tequila. We chilled for a minute after that, playing poker and talking as Will prepared the first line for each of us. When it was my turn to blow at about 8PM, I sniffed up what I think is an average-sized line in two inhalations. Again, I felt no discomfort from the powder except for the bitter drip in the back of my throat that followed. Beer was very useful for killing that taste in my throat.<br>
<br>
The effects the coke had on me include a boost in energy, a warm feeling throughout my body, increased focus, loss of social inhibitions, and increased heart rate. Mentally, I felt a peace of mind, similar to the feeling I have had when on ecstasy but without the speedy feeling, which I dislike. I felt like my mind had been purged of the various things that demand my attention throughout the day; I could focus completely on anything I wished.<br>
<br>
I experienced these effects after every line I would take that night. Oddly, neither time while using coke did I feel any euphoria, the main effect sought by coke users.<br>
Even though we were hanging out for 10+ hours, the time seemed to fly by. In summary of the night's key events, 1. we played Texas hold-em as a drinking game (loser(s) have to drink), 2. I had a nice conversation with Rocky, catching up on the things going on in our lives, 3. we smoked a couple bowls and drank like fish, 4. a LOT of talking took place, 5. we went outside at about 3:30AM to get some fresh air, and 6. we each had 5 average-sized lines spread out throughout the night, the last ingested around 4:00AM.<br>
<br>
I estimate that we each had about .6-.7 grams of coke that night. I don't think the last line had much of an effect on me; around 4:30AM my memory gets very sketchy. I think maybe my mental fatigue began to overwhelm the effects of the coke. I remember feeling the most drunk I have ever been without getting sick. However, I still didn't feel like sleeping until I fell asleep around 6:30AM. I awoke at 10:00AM and, feeling no ill effects from the night before, went home for some much needed breakfast. That was a very laid back day during which I slept about 12-14 hours. I had a great time at the party even though my memory is a bit fuzzy at certain points.<br>
<br>
Summary: I guess coke does not work as well for me as it does for others; I can think of no explanation for the lack of euphoria. Still, it was fun, but it is definitely not one of my favorites. I know the coke was good quality because the more experienced users told me they were feeling it. I will never buy my own bag of coke since it is ridiculously expensive and it doesn't seem to work well for me. I might try some in the future if it is offered to me, but I don't plan on trying coke again for quite some time.<!--   End Body   -->

Lets see...it was Friday and when I woke up for school. I felt a need to be messed up, so I took 600 mgs of Zoloft. The rest of the day I was really cloudy, my vision seemed to have static around the edges, most people probably woundn't like it but, I do. Anywayz, that night there was a football game. I could sort of feel the Zoloft, but much of the buzz or high was gone. I went, receiving the 1800 mgs of Gabapentin during it. I took them immediately, so I would say around 7:30 or so. When the Gabapentin kicked in, around 8:00 or 8:15, I became very happy, yet tired at the same time. The world seemed to move up and down, as in a wave. At the end of the game, I walked up a hill to exit, and this hill seemed huge, but in reality it was barely even a hill. I went straight home and went to bad. <br>
<br>
When I was in bed, I began to trip, I think maybe because of the darkness. Way walls seemed to breathe, and I closed my eyes. The image was very faded, but I thought I was in my kitchen, and I saw a bag of popcorn in the microwave. I love popcorn, so I went to press the start button, and my hand went though the microwave. I immediately jumped back to reality, and my arm was extended, my finger too, as if I was actually going to push the button. I closed my eyes again, and, the picture still faded, I saw a dragon and a knight fighting. I thought this was the greatest thing ever, as I had never tripped before, and watched the to fight until I passed into sleep.<br>
<br>
All in all, I loved it. From that moment on, my favorite pill was Gabapentin.<!--   End Body   -->

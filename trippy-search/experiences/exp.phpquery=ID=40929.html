Synthetic GABA I think is what this is.  That's at least what I tell my friends when they ask what the new cap that I'm taking is and phenibut sounds like a goofy joke.  I've been taking phenibut for about a month now on and off, mostly because I like trying new substances and seeing how they affect my consciousness.  I've never heard of phenibut in the drug circles that I run with, it's legal as a supplement I'm pretty sure, has a good amount of evidentiary experiences in Russia as a sleep aid and anti-anxiety drug and although it doesn't feel like a benzo exactly, I would have to say I like it better than most of the benzo's I tried.  <BR>
<BR>
I took two grams this morning.  I cap them myself.  I woke up in a hotel -- been traveling for work and invited my girlfriend to stay with me for a week, so we've been staying up late and playing every night.  Dragging myself out of bed is hard, late nights combined with substance use (non-phenibut) always makes 6:45am suck hard.  I'm not a caffeine user, so normally I’m groggy for about 45 minutes before I’m functional, and then, normally, if I've had as little sleep as I've been going on lately, I can't wait for the end of the day so I can go home and pass out.  Since starting the phenibut this has changed.  <BR>
<BR>
After about 25 minutes from taking it, I feel good.  Not adulterated good, but just like, 'this is going to be a good day, I feel positive and that I'm going to be able to function well today.'  Today is the same.  I got out of bed and sat on the corner of the bed for a minute holding my head and trying to talk myself into being ready for my day.  I then got up and took the phenibut and got dressed and drove to work.  I was at work about 15 minutes after getting out of bed, so I'm still groggy at that point.  I'm starting to notice the phenibut as others arrive and I ask them how they're doing and notice that I actually care.... normally without sleep I kinda hide away and don't engage people because I just feel all around icky.  <BR>
<BR>
I would say it's sublime. I like it.<!--   End Body   -->

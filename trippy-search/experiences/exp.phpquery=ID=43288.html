I find marijuana to be as strong as 6' very good san pedro.  And I find that lecithin potentiates it (lecithin potentiation could be placebo, but it's been my experience). I was very stressed out about work before the trip.  I spent half an hour meditating to calm down.  Still stressed after that- but i've never been afraid of salvia.  Trusting it and flowing with the experience always works for me.  So I chose to trip anyway. I was hungry for more intensity from my salvia experiences, hence the combo. Beforehand I prayed to salvia to show me its light several times.<BR>
<BR>
T-4 took 4g lecithin on empty stomach<BR>
<BR>
The thc had been extracted a week before with an internet tek.  Basically used 151 to extract- not a pure extraction at all. Prepped blue lotus+thc extract+wild dagga infusion.  Prepped these things by steeping them in approx 3 shots of 151 proof grain alcohol and placing the bottle in a sink with running hot water for a few hours.  Then strained.<BR>
<BR>
T=0 drank this infusion and started chewing a teaspoon of salvia.  Turned on milkdrop.<BR>
<BR>
T+20 effects not intense, head feels quite different, light, warm, womblike feeling.  Dont feel drunk or stoned like I would expect.  Quid is hardly working.<BR>
<BR>
T+30 decided I would SMOKE the salvia.  Loaded a water bong... Started falling into familiar salvia space.  Smoked more and more to see how far I could get...<BR>
<BR>
T+40 I was looking into the mind of god. <BR>
<BR>
Overall a very rewarding experience.  Given my a lot to think about.<BR>
<BR>
I'm still looking for something more with salvia.  It's called me for something.  I don't know what.  It wanted to show me this but I know it has something special in mind.  Every trip is like it's showing me more and more.  This one I feel like opening up a little more, 'by the way you know us plants are the voice/s of god'  Eventually it will open up and really get intimate with me.  I view this experience is part of my initiation.<BR>
<BR>
At the peak of my trip I was looking into the mind of god and seeing far away realities.  God has an alien mind.  God has infinite intelligence.  Do you think he's thinking about what he's going to do at 3 o'clock?  The thoughts in his mind are so strange and bizarre and alien that we can't imagine... Basically, god does not care about us.  He is this super intelligence.  And he has a voice, and his voice is these plants.  His plants speak in vision.  The visions are fractallated hallucinations: what is seen through plants.  ...I was impressed by how incredibly alien god's intelligence was.<BR>
<BR>
Background: I never thought that god cared about us.  I always thought 'god is the universe.'  If you had asked me, what does god think?  I would have said nothing, he has no mind, he's just the universe.  Pressed I would have said, his mind is the human groupmind.  But that's totally bullshit anthropocentrism.  Humanity is such a tiny speck in the consciousness of the universe...  What about alien races for example?  The universe is pretty vast; the odds may be good that there's other races.<BR>
<BR>
I was reading a discussion on some entheogen site of how cartesian thinking plagues us...  I had always thought it was bullshit to say there's a difference between mind and matter.  Yet I always assumed that I had consciousness and an inanimate object didn't.  But that's cartesian dualism too, if you think about it. It's like, all matter has a quality of consciousness to it, even if the value of that quality is zero (for example zero happens when you die- when you return to the void from whence you came).<BR>
<BR>
But God's mind is all this consciousness.  All the zero, and all the plus, all of it.  The human race, the alien races, the plants.  God speaks to us through the plants.  The visions we see are his language; when people say 'you can't describe what tripping is like'- it's because you're coming face to face with the thoughts of god.  And it's totally bizarre and alien and when we come back, we bring little glimpses of it and take it into our reality- but it doesn't really have anything to do with our reality.  It's the mind of god, and god doesn't care about us.  It's stepping into a different thoughtstream.  The thoughtstream we're in is bizarre too- it just doesnt seem that way to us since we're born into it and we've forgotten how alien it was in the beginning.<BR>
<BR>
Ps. Basically we've been tripping in this human reality trip all our lives and have forgotten it's a trip too - do you remember your first memories as a little kid and the tripping=discovery you experienced?  That's because our home is the void.<!--   End Body   -->

Going into my fourth experience with mushrooms, I was experiencing my usual anxiety before the come up. It was already 2 AM and three of my good friends and I had eaten the cubensis at 1:30 AM. I began to feel the rush in my stomach and suddenly I knew it was coming. The mushroom had me. <br>
<br>
The room we were in had walls made of light brown wooden planks that had black knots in them (yeeeeehaaaaaa for the visuals). I began to see the knots and rings in the wood moving and changing positions. At this time I was sitting in a chair with a heavy down blanket covering me. We were watching some jump roping championship on ESPN2 and that was probably where all my problems in the night began. I began to feel tears come down my cheeks and I thought I was crying. I looked to my friends and they all looked at me in astonishment. I was gushing tears, but my face remained barren. That is when I knew I was fucked up to the max. We decided to turn of the tv and put Paul Oakenfold's New York Global Underground CD 2 into the stereo. <br>
<br>
Music always has a definate impact in how my trip is going, so when the trance came on I was launched out of my mind. I began kneeling down and staring at the carpet. Small bumps that looked like mice running under the carpet had me at full attention. I then decided to lie down on my side and complete the sitting circle that my friends were sitting in. We jabbered about nothing (literaly) and suddenly the music hit a speed of Mach 5. It was going so fast that I couldn't understand the sound that I was hearing. All of the sudden there was no sound, and I looked up to the stereo to see that my friend had taked the CD out and was changing it to DJ Sasha. I experienced time at 50X the normal speed. I can't explain it, but that was where I lost my mind. <br>
<br>
I was so scared that I had finally eaten enough to make me go insane. I thought that my brain wouldn't recover from this journey. I got up and sat on the couch. The music seemed so distant and quiet that I barely knew it was there. I tranced into deep thought and began sorrowing about my life and how I need to get my shit together in school and in life. I became extremely irritable and scared. I remained pissed off for the remainder of the trip, and the entire time I wanted to come down so bad. I finally came down completely at 6:30 AM but of course I was wide awake and scared shitless. I can't remember everything that happened but man, that was nuts. That was the trip to end all trips for me.<!--   End Body   -->

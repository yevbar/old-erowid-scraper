First off I want to say, that anyone that is thinking about trying any new drug, or for that matter any old drug, should do their homework. And furthermore, one should nor really ingest any drug in any form or fashion.<br>
<br>
As usual it all began on one of my usual (by usual I mean daily heh) romps around the internet looking for god knows what. I just love reading about all the different chemicals and the creative things people have found to do with them.  I come across this 2C-I stuff that I had previously heard about in a newsgroup and I think a few other places. After reading a bit about the chemical I found a place to purchase 250 mg.  <br>
<br>
The place had great service and I recieved the package in the mail the next day.  It was NOT split into any kind of dossage, and me being with out scales, I simply split the whole pile into 3 equal size piles (very very carefully done to make sure they were extremely even) which comes to about 74mg per pile. I then split each of the three piles into 4 more even pile which aould be roughly 18-21 mg per dose. I know that is not a very acurate form of measuring dosage, but seeing how it was a safe dose amount even at the highest amount, it didn't really matter. <br>
<br>
<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: A volume amount of one powder doesn't necessarily weigh the same as the same volume of another powder. For substances active at such a small dose, eyeballing is particularly unwise. See <a href="../psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.html">related article</a>]</FONT><br>
<br>
Not having any empty gel caps, which seem to be the most popular form of ingestion, I ripped part of a rolling paper and scooped a dose off into the middle of it and then wrapped it up into a pill size ball careful not to spill any.  I then swallowed the paper which tasted just like blueberrys (the flavor I had, and it was a rice paper btw, not the other kind).  <br>
<br>
After waiting close to an hour and half (apparently I didn't do enough HW on this drug, because it can take up to two hours to kick in, especially since I ate directly following ingestion.) I decided nothing was happing, I didn't know if it was the way i took it in the rolling paper, or if it was a defective product (aka ripped off), so I did as any extremely couriuse, worried he got ripped off, eager, not really carring hippy would do.  I mixed another half dose in with a glass of lemonade.  15 min later I then reapeted this taking another half does, which bring the count up to some where between 36 and 42mg.  <br>
<br>
About 15 min. later I begin feeling tired and frustrated that nothing is happening and tell my roomate that I am going to bed (he didn't take any). After laying in bed with my eyes closed for around 10 - 20 min. I realize something is different, so i open my eyes and notice the ceiling is all 3d looking and slightly spinning.  I get out of bed to see what, we will call him Mr. N, is doing. Mr. N suggest we go play Halo 2, so I aggree, loving the game, and wanting something to do.  <br>
<br>
At first, it was just like trying to play as though I was drunk, funny feeling, but still able to control.  Half an hour to an hour into the game (its hard to tell time on this stuff) I realize, I have no fucking idea whats going on, I can't really see/understand the game as it comes into my brain. The colors are all mixing together, and things are moving when they really aren't, and mostly the screen just looked like a large pool of splashed on colors that shifted often. After I notice this I tried to play some more, and thinking back on it, somehow I was doing amazingly good on the game (playing in heroic mode), it was as if my body was just playing without me having to process the actual game ( I play it ALOT).  <br>
<br>
I announce to Mr. N that I have no idea whats going on, and that I can't play this any more.  We watch TV for a bit, then for some odd reason I decide to go lay in bed and try to go to sleep, its been about 3 hours in to the trip.  This is when I am guessing the second dose comes on.  While laying in bed, i stare at the ceiling, and floors, and walls.  Its hard to explain this, but at first, my brain seemed to just be, like dead, nothing was going on, I couldn't really think, I can remember it, but at the times, I was just blank, just looking around taking everything in.  <br>
<br>
I started having some trouble breathing (this lasted the reas of the trip). I could breath just fine, but I had to manualy breath if that makes since, I wasn't automaticly breathing on my own, I had to think about it to do it.  I wanted so bad to go to sleep, as I had been up for a very long period of time. It was around 4 or 5 in the morning when I began to get my mind back, but it didn't just slowly come back or come back at once, instead it was like loops of what was happening.  I would be feeling really good for a little while and loving the way I felt, then a few min. later I would get aother wave of visuals which would last for a few min and then be immediatly followed by a moment of mind blankness where I would just sit there with an empty head as if no function was going on which was accompanied with queesyness (sp?) and a fear of dying from overdose (by this time I realized I had taken too much). <br>
<br>
The trip did this for what seemed like hours.  The best way I can compare it to is huffing freon or canned duster and taking in a hit waiting for it to stop, then taking another.  I later (don't know what time) went into the bathroom to throw some water in my face and help some, I was shaking and full of eneregy with no output, having trouble breathing, and just plain scarred.  I endedup standing and drinking from the sink for about 30 min. (lol how odd it seems now) then I stood and stared into the mirror to my enjoyment watching my face contort into many differnt patterns which mostly consisted of imploding/exploding (not like blowing up exploding, but bending outwards). I recall that it kinda made me look like Joe Camel. <br>
<br>
I finally passed out in bed sometime around 11 am. (some 14 hours later). All in all it was quite an experience.  I will never let this happen again, it was not fun and very dangerous. If I ingest this stuff again I would be safe and not ingest anymore untill the next day, just incase.  And as I said always, always do your homework on any new chemical you may choose to take, there are always things you will need to know about it.<!--   End Body   -->

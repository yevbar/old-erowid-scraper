Aparently some people enjoy this drug, and some people don't.  I was one of those who absolutly despised it.  What happend to me isn't going to happen to everyone, but I will say I don't recommend it because if you do get the bad side effects, you'll know it wasn't worth finding out.<br>
<br>
6:00PM CDT<br>
I decided since I've gotten somewhat comfortable with OTC's with my frequent DXM use that something else was worth trying.  I kept hearing about Dramamine from friends and how they experienced heavier visuals than they've had on anything else.  I became curious so I searched the net for Dramamine info.  Most people take a whole tube(12 pills, 50mg each) so I thought I'd do the same. It was 6pm when I took them, and I awaited the experience.<br>
<br>
6:30PM CDT<br>
I smoked a cigarette upstairs in my room.  No cool effects yet, but I did get kind of drowsy.<br>
<br>
6:45PM CDT<br>
I felt extremely light headed when I got up to go down to my basement(my trip spot).  Before I went downstairs I stopped and had a soda and watched football with my dad for a while in the living room.  We had a short conversation about how the Badgers arent playing well.<br>
<br>
7:10PM CDT<br>
I began feeling VERY light headed.  As if my skull was filled with helium, and if it wasn't attatched to me it would float away.  I came to the conclusion I was too messed up to be around my dad, so I walked my way downstairs.  Walking felt so weird.  It was like there was little gravity, or too much gravity, I couldn't make up my mind which.  I walked down the stairs, and opened the door and closed it.  I looked over at the couch to see my friend Evan.  'How did he get in?' I thought.  He whispered to me 'Hey man, you want some of this dex?'.  He had capsules with pure DXM in them!  I was stoked!  He gave me 2 and I took them into the bathroom, opened a pepsi that was sitting in the bathroom and took them.<br>
<br>
It was as real as anything that is real could be, but as I put the pepsi down it wouldn't land on the counter.  I felt like I was getting it low enough to touch the counter but I couldnt feel it touching it.  I looked up into the mirror and noticed my pupils were tiny.  Smaller than I have ever seen them.  I made my hand with the pepsi in it tighter, but felt my fingers touch and I made a complete fist.  I thought I dropped the pepsi and I looked around for the mess I had made, but there was no mess.  THERE WAS NO PEPSI.<br>
<br>
I went into the other room to notice Evan wasn't there!  I could have sworn I had taken that DXM, I could have sworn Evan gave them to me.  I went upstairs to ask my dad 'Did Evan stop by at all today?' 'No, I've been home all day and I havn't seen him'.  At that time I thought I was crazy.  I needed a cigarette BAD from all that.  I went upstairs into my room and saw an empty bottle of Dramamine. 'Oh I forgot I took that but there is NO WAY motion sickness medicine could get me that fucked up!'.  At that time I wanted to think it was the drug, but I just couldn't believe it.  DXM never did anything that weird.<br>
<br>
7:45PM CDT<br>
I reached for my pack of smokes and lit one up.  It was as real as any other cigarette I have ever smoked, but my god it was gone before my eyes.  I looked in my pack of cigarettes and realized I didn't have any left, and the one I smoked before the trip was my last one.  At this point it was getting very weird for me, and I started feeling anxiety.  'What could happen next?' I thought to myself.  I tried to calm down, but I couldn't.<br>
<br>
8:00PM CDT<br>
I went back into the basement panicing.  I layed down and tried to relax.  The TV was off, so I could see the reflection from the TV into the back of the room.  As I looked in the TV I saw the reflection of a tall man in a trech coat, using hand signals to communicate with someone off in another part of the room that I could not see. I began to panic again.  I saw a pair of scissors on the table so I quickly grabbed it and looked around the room prepaired(not really) for whatever was there. But once again, nothing was there.<br>
<br>
8:20PM CDT<br>
I calmed down and wrote all over my arm with a sharpie 'YOUR TRIPPIN, NOTHINGS REAL' so I would remember because I kept forgetting.<br>
<br>
8:30PM CDT<br>
I needed to take a leak real bad so I made my way to the bathroom.  I looked at the light switch as I was about to turn it on to see a HUGE moth.  One of those moths the size of my hand! Ran back into the other room in fear (I hate moths).  I started biting my nails and noticed something written on my hand 'YOUR TRIPPIN, NOTHINGS REAL' it said.  Then I remembered I was tripping haha.  So I went back to the bathroom to notice the moth was gone.<br>
<br>
I looked into the mirror after I pissed.  It felt like there was something on the back of my head because I could feel it in my hair.  I looked at the back of my head with another mirror to see a HUGE spider!  I rubbed my head and all over in frustration.  That time as soon as I saw it I remembered I was trippin.  At that time I thought 'Ok, this is enough. I'm Done.'  I figured since I was already very drowsy that I could just go to bed and sleep it off.<br>
<br>
8:50PM CDT<br>
I turn off the lights and climb into bed, still tripping hard.  I am very uncomfortable, and I stuggled to find a comfortable position.<br>
<br>
9:00PM CDT<br>
I was VERY tired but still couldn't sleep because I couldnt get comfortable.  My legs felt very strange, so I would have to stretch them with all my strength to make that weird feeling go away.  The feeling would come back 10 seconds after doing it.  I began to jolt in my bed violently.  It was the most horrible thing ever.<br>
<br>
9:30PM CDT<br>
I am still violently jolting my legs in my bed, still can't sleep.<br>
<br>
10:00PM CDT<br>

<br>
11:00PM CDT<br>

<br>
12:00AM CDT<br>
same<br>
<br>
That was the last time I even checked the time, but I'm guessing I finally fell asleep around 12:15-12:45.  It was the worst experience of my life.  For some reason a few months later I gave it another try.  No hallucinations like last time, but the feeling in my leg happend again.  It wasn't as bad, and I was able to force myself to sleep in a good 20 minutes.  Still not worth it I don't think.  At a point in both those trips I considered suicide because that feeling in my legs was unbarable.  That's how agonizing that feeling was.  I dont know what it was, but Im sure its nothing healthy.  Since the first trip I've been scared for life. I learned that there is a difference between visuals and hallucinations.<br>
<br>
Visuals=Things that are there, but are altered in some way. The walls moving, ground breathing, stretching, double vision, closed eye visuals.<br>
<br>
Hallucinations=Things that just aren't there!<!--   End Body   -->

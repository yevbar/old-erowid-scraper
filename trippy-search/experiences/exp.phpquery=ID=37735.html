My brother and I had ordered 1g of DPT from a research chemical site.  We had no real reliable way of measuring the dosage, so we used the 'cutting piles in half until you get to the approximate dosage' method.  The first few times we took it at low dosages to test the effects and our individual sensitivity.  It seemed mild compared to other halucinogens I've tried (LSD, mushrooms, MDMA, PCP, salvia divinorum...), so one day, when I was alone and bored, I decided to take a little trip.  I had complete confidence in my ability to handle a powerful halucinagen alone, so I foolishly ignored the sitter rule when it comes to DPT.  I proceded to 'guesstimate' a decent dose.  In hindsight, it was probably about 200-250mg, but about 30 minutes after insufflation, I thought I had taken 300mg or more and could not calculate what I had just done to myself.<BR>
<BR>
The first thing I did was take a shower.  By the time I got out and was back in my room, I was really starting to feel the effects of this powerful drug.  It was like NONE of the other substances I had done in the past.  It came in huge waves like MDMA, and gave a great tingly body high like MDMA, but that's where the similarity ends.  This thing took me and when the waves hit, I had ZERO control over thoughts/visuals/body movement, etc.  After about 1 hour, I started panicking because it was sooooo much stronger than the previous small doses and I wasn't sure if I had done the right amount or 3 times the right amount.  I started hyperventilating at the same time I was trying to calm myself down with deep breaths and positive affirmations.  The deep breaths obviously made the hyperventilation worse, so I stopped that immediately.<BR>
<BR>
As with some other halucies, all of this was accompanied by a deep, twisted, internal, psychological drama that had the overall effect of pure horror.  I'm going to skip some details concerning how, but I ended up in a car with my step-grandfather, headed to the hospital.  Keep in mind that I was 30 years old and had a very normal life.  I had and still have an awesome loving girlfriend who knows nothing of this experience (although I'm planning on telling her soon).  The entire ride there was hell on wheels.  When the waves came, I was convinced that I was going to die.  I felt like I couldn't handle them, but the only way out was to kill myself, but then I would have the terrifying thought that I may be trapped in this state in the afterlife for eternity as my own personal hell because of what I had done to myself.  I don't know if that is just the result of years of catholic upbringing laying on the guilt, but it was nonetheless THE most scary thought I've ever had.  Not just being stuck like that for life, but for eternity!  It still gives me the chills.  <BR>
<BR>
So anyway, we get to the hospital and as we're pulling up, a wave has just subsided and I feel like maybe I can get by without the HUGE medical bill I was about to incur.  Just when I was trying to explain my reasoning to my step-grandfather, another wave was coming on and it turned into incoherent babbling.  It just made him drive faster.<BR>
<BR>
We pull up to the emergency room entrance and my sgfather goes inside, returning with a large, conveniently bug-eyed nurse who was pushing a wheelchair.  I got out of the car and climbed in, all the time thinking that I'd be fine if I just wait it out and then I could avoid this financial expense.  The doctor who ended up treating me had long hair and mentioned his experience with LSD in the 60s.  That was very comforting, but it also made me feel like an idiot for allowing myself to get into this position.  I should have known better and I told him that.  All of this coherent thought was in between waves of intense insanity.  He took my pulse and some blood and put me on an EKG monitor.  He then proceded to give me a sedative and a potassium suppliment (apparently, the blood test revealed low potassium levels).  I woke up a couple of hours later with some family members present and a whole lot of embarassment.<BR>
<BR>
It has now been about 6 months since that incident and I am living with my girlfriend in NC.  She still doesn't know that it happened and she may never.  Here's the problem though:<BR>
<BR>
Lately, I've been waking up from disturbing dreams and finding myself in a DPT flashback.  Tonight, I woke up and had scary thoughts that would persist, keeping me from falling back asleep. When I went out into my living room with the lights on, I felt a lot like I did that fateful day.  Waves of anxiety, accompanied by the thought that I may slip back into a full on trip for the rest of my life.  I was compelled to look online for an answer.  There was a page about how some people experience anxiety attacks after a bad trip on LSD.  I thought this could be the case for DPT as well, although they are very different, chemically.  It also said that it's not the drug that causes the attacks, any traumatic experience can bring this condition on.  That sounds more like it to me.  I mean if that experience wasn't traumatic, I don't know what is.  The problem is I won't have medical insurance for another 2.5 months, so I may have to self-medicate with Wellbutrin or Xanax or something.  As you can guess, I'm not very comfortable with self-medication anymore.<BR>
<BR>
In closing, I would recommend that anyone thinking about trying this substance look elsewhere.  Psilocybin is much safer and much more pleasant - even compared to low doses of DPT.<!--   End Body   -->

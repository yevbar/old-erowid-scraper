<!--   Start Body   -->


Several months ago, I began experiencing increasingly uncomfortabe panic attacks:  tunnel-vision, light-headedness, loud and irregular heart-pounding, feelings of impending doom, and overwhelming fear of death.  All accompanied by an enormous wall of denial - like if I just didn't think about it or admit it to myself or anyone else, it would go away.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, I developed a condition known as 'globus hystericans,' or in plain English, 'the hysterical feeling of something caught in your throat'.  Indeed.  I kid you not - after a week or so of panicking about the fucking TUMOR I could feel in my throat, I freaked out and made my partner take me to the emergency room.  2 x-rays, a barium-swallow test, and a thyroid ultrasound later, I find out that it's just my goddamned MIND sabbotaging my own happiness.<BR>
<BR>
One short visit to a local doctor earned me a script for Effexor, a new pharmie for anxiety/depression.  Mind you, he spoke to me for all of 15 minutes, and this was my first visit.  Let me let you in on a little something about the pharmecutical business in America.  In America, I don't believe there's a single doctor yet who pays for his/her own lunch.  No, really.  Every doctor spends lunchtime being wooed by big-business drug salesmen.  I work at a restaurant and we do a shitload of caterings for drug reps - on company money, of course.  I imagine a free lunch everyday is only the tip of the greasy iceberg . . . but I digress.<BR>
<BR>
My doc had an Effexor pen, a NICE kinda chunky spaceage pen like they'd use on the shuttle.  He had Effexor post-it notes.  Man, for all I know he had Effexor underwear.  Ok, so I take the meds, and lo and behold, after a few days of feeling pretty cracked-out and sketchy, I started to feel, well, better, yes better and the lump in my throat melted away, and I could sleep thru the night without feeling like I was having a heart-attack.  In fact, I felt pretty good:  the panic attacks and fainting spells went away, and I felt like my old self again, to my immense relief.  I loved my meds.<BR>
<BR>
Skip ahead 6 months.  I've lost my health insurance, and now I have to pay full price for the magic beans.  100 lousy dollars a month, oh, but I pay, I pay BELIEVE ME.  Here's the real kick in the ass:  sometimes due to poverty or forgetfullness or drunkenness, I neglect to take my meds.  Sometimes I forget for two days.  After two days of no Effexor, I experience very uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms.  Full body muscle tension -  I find I have to constantly remind myself to RELAX and unclench my aching muscles.<BR>
<BR>
A terrifying electric-shock sensation, must have something to do with adrenelin (?) - it feels like that surge of panic I get when I'm trying to fall asleep and it feels like I fall off a cliff - only when awake, and then over, and over, and over, and over, and you can't shake it off.  Feeling VERY cracked-out and confused, weepy and nearly hysterical.  Unable to speak complex thoughts - like you forget what you mean to say while you're saying it - very confusing and frustrating.  Shaky and kinda bug-eyed and staring at nothing.  Like I'm totally about to lose my shit.  <BR>
<BR>
I hate it.  Needless to say, I ALWAYS remember my meds by the third day, and you know what?  With sufficient levels of the drug in my system, I feel fine, really functional.  And if that's not the goddamned definition of addiction, I'd like to know what is.  So now what?  Talk to my goddamned doctor?  Go cold-turkey and flip out for a few days (weeks?months??).  Resign to live as a functional addict FOR AS LONG AS I CAN AFFORD IT??  Goddamn goddamn bastards hooking me on their lousy miracle brain medicine and then making me pay.<!--   End Body   -->

<!--   Start Body   -->


My friend had brought back a vial of acid from school this winter, and I LOVE diving into other -alities, so I thought it would be a good idea to go up to Tahoe and play in the snow (I always wanted to stick my mind in bright white light).  We went up to an unfurnished cabin the night before and slept on the floor.  I was so excited and anxious that I only slept for about five to six hours.  I was dissapointed with my sleeping performance because I find I trip best after a nice long deep sleep.<BR>
<BR>
11:30--I awoke to an empty house.  Everyone else went snowboarding for the day. I stretched out my body, paying extra attention to my neck and spine.  <BR>
<BR>
12:00--I put a drop on my tongue.  It didn't taste like lucy.  It was  bitter and minty.  It tasted like a diluted breath mint and tingled on my tongue, which was ironic because the vial was one of those Ice Drop containers used to make your breath fresh.  I listened to some music to get me in the right state of mind, while waiting for the acid to take hold.  I expected to start seeing things move after the first half hour, but nothing.  Although I did feel slightly euphoric and a tad gassy.  Burping felt really good.  My friend tried it before coming up and said that it came on slow and that he didn't see too many visuals.  He had taken only one hit.<BR>
<BR>
1:00--So I decided I needed another hit.  One more drop on my tongue with the same bitter taste, reminiscent of cocaine.  I thought it a good time to go outside and see how the snow was doing.  Walking through the snow was hard, but really fun.  I felt child-like.  Dogs tied up to trees were barking at me.  I thought about barking back, but took the thought back, and made snow angels instead.  My body was getting very warm from all the physical exersion so I thought I better go back to the cabin and explore it a bit.  I went to the mirror to gauge myself.  The visuals were very light and I had to focus really hard to get things moving.  Playing with a concave mirror was entertaining enough.<BR>
<BR>
2:00--Another drop on my tongue.  I never took any acid that took this long to kick in.  I continued to try and trip myself out but with very little success.  Still weak visuals, but the body high was working well.  I decided I needed another walk.  I strolled through the neighborhood gazing at the clouds, the architecture, and the tree lines.  I LOVE conifers.  Deep drawn out breaths of cold air gave me some diamonds to look at, but they didn't last.  I laid in the snow and watched cirrus clouds streak by for a while.  No lucy in the sky.  The only way I could get decent visuals was to keep my eyes open for a long period of time, while focusing on one point and the whole sky at the same time.  But as soon as I blinked I would have to start over.  Too much mind work was involved.<BR>
<BR>
3:00--I was beginning to doubt that this was acid.  One more drop.  Damn it's bitter.  I started to think that there was some cocaine in these Ice Drops.  I looked around the cabin.  It was a cabin.  I listened to some music.  It was music.  I looked in the mirror.  It was me and I wasn't going anywhere.  I was very dissapointed.  Everything looked pretty normal.  I decided to read the new Adbusters magazine, thinking that it would give me some good thoughts.  There was a bill of human rights on one of the pages.  I read it out loud to myself with some Jeff Beck playing in the background.  I was really getting my head into these thoughts and by the time I read the last line I was feeling amazing.  My whole body tingled with those words: 'I HAVE THE RIGHT TO COMMUNICATE'  I repeated them over and over again each time feeling better and better.  Eventually, I could say no more because I was glowing with energy and might have spontaneously combusted if I said it again.  But I still thought it.  The visuals got stronger but not strong enough to get lost in them.  All I could do now was prance around and wait for everyone to get back from snowboarding.<BR>
<BR>
5:30--My friends returned from a nice rough day on the slopes.  They were plastered.  The three of them had drunken a bottle of champagne, two 40z, two tall cans, and a 24 pack.  They were tired and I was rarin' to go.  We settled on smoking a bowl in the midget room (There's always one when you need it).  I was feeling pretty good except for the gas in my belly.  <BR>
<BR>
6:00--We smoked a bowl.  I only took two rips.  I got hella high.  After the second one I was sure my body was going to hurl.  I really didn't want to hurl so I closed my eyes and concentrated on my insides.  I had complete control of my body.  I could feel where the air bubble was, I just had to manuever it through my intestines to my stomach.  From my stomach I split the big bubble up into many little bubbles and sent those little bubbles up through my throat and out my mouth.  It took me about five to ten minutes to accomplish this.  And when I was done I felt extremely well.  There's those damn diamonds.  I was so proud of myself for burping, but no one else seemed very impressed.  I had just willed that puke not to spill out.  Mind over matter, man.  <BR>
<BR>
7:00--Time to go.  My ride had to be home for Channukah the next day so I gathered myself up and all the peices of myself that I had dropped during the afternoon and threw me in the car.  The three hour ride home was quite a ride.  Especially, after it started raining really hard and the windsheild wiper broke (there was only one to begin with).  There were so many different layers.  My mind could be riding drops of rain up the window, following the tail lights of the cars, or track the landscape as we whizzed by.  Music on the ride home was amazing, I highly recommend riding with 2 twelves in the trunk, you can really feel the music.  I had to put on the Chemical Brothers' SURRENDER.  I was under the influence and definately responded to the beats.  <BR>
<BR>
There were other troubles on the way home, but they aren't worth mentioning.  What is worth mentioning though is the word 'Smile' because I never once stopped smiling for the rest of the night.  I just stared at my aesbestos covered cieling until the sun rose.  Watched it come up, smoked a bowl, and went to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
Two weeks after this, so called, acid trip I found out that it wasn't acid at all but the tryptamine 5-MeO-AMT.  This is why the visuals were weak/none and why I could communicate with other human beings relatively well.  Although, taking a piss at a gas station was a lot more confusing than it should have been.  5-MeO-AMT was good, but acid is better.<BR>
<BR>
ACID IS: FOREVER MOVING BREATHING SEEING DOING ALWAYS THINKING FUTURE MOVING ALWAYS MOVING NEVER BEING SINKING SLIPPING SWIMMING NEVER REACHING ALWAYS STRIVING BETTER FORCES LAY WITHIN<!--   End Body   -->

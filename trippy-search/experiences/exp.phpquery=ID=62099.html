At 22, I am enjoying myself, getting through college, and liking boys.  One of my excellent stress relievers is to enjoy a substance, and while under the influence, make love.  It makes sex more spiritual.  This experience with mushrooms and sex is worth telling.<br>
<br>
Finding mushrooms was not difficult.  I asked a guy that was selling regular gourmet mushrooms at a farmers market that I have known for awhile.  He came up with 2.5 grams of dried shrooms, and said that they were a variety called oasis.  <br>
<br>
So, I invited my man over on a Saturday afternoon.  He called me about 45 minutes before he arrived and about 10 minutes before he arrived, I ingested 1.00 grams of dried shrooms.  The mushrooms were chopped finely, and taken on a slice of rye bread with honey.  My intention was to enhance my environment, and not take a mind bending trip, so I think my dosage was lower than one might want to take.  I told my man that I had taken some shrooms, and wanted to “feel” him while the shrooms had me.<br>
<br>
About 30 minutes after ingestion, my sense of smell became much more intense.  Take for instance, if I smell a pizza.  Well this was like, smelling the ingredients of a pizza, instead of smelling just the pizza.  My man was with me, lying on the bed, with his shirt off.  I was taking in his essence.  This made me incredibly amorous.  <br>
<br>
As we made love, the oneness became overwhelming,  I truly have never been so close to someone.  Every sensation was amplified.  He began at my feet, and enveloped me.  I became part of him, like I was inside of him.  This was incredible, and the culmination of this was long lasting.<br>
<br>
The amplification, of sexual contact caused by low doses of mushrooms is beyond compare.<!--   End Body   -->

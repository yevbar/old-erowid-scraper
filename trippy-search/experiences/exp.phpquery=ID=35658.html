This is my strange story.  It is one of the key changing points of my life.<br>
<br>
I was invited to a private rave, in Florida, that was held in an open field by the woods.  The rave started at 3:00 pm with drinking beer in the hot June sun while listening to music.  I stopped drinking two hours before the sun went down and started taking whippets and smoking marijuana.  Around 9:00 pm I took one ecstasy pill.  The ecstasy was not pure.  I noticed MDMA in it; but it evidently had a hallucinogenic drug that I did not recognize.  Once I began to feel the ecstasy I started walking around the field talking to the other ravers.  One group told me that people are getting strange effects from the kind of ecstasy I took.  Another person, I did not know, told me that seeing me reminded him of the movie Beatle Juice.  This analogy of comparing me to the strange outer world of Beatle Juice stuck with me for my entire night.  <br>
<br>
Around 10:00 pm I took another ecstasy pill.  It was around this time that the rave started to get more intense.  More people were in the field doing light shows and playing music.  Wisely one of my friends had the idea of leaving while one of us could still drive.  Around 11:00 pm we reached the house and I took another ecstasy pill.  My roll reached its peak during the hours of 11:00-12:00.  During this time I used whippets and light sticks to increase the roll.<br>
<br>
Around 12:00 am while on a whippet, my mind entered into an advanced state of thinking.   I began to feel that the entire world we know is only an illusion of a greater truth and design.  As this happened my state of conscious began to open into what seemed to be true existence without regard to emotions or desires.  While in this trance state I began to merge all the areas of knowledge known to me.  I mixed western science, cosmology, Buddhist philosophy, western atheism, and Islamic thinking into a single hegemony of thought.<br>
<br>
I began to see the entire human species as a developing chemical compound that is organizing into a living organism.  I began to see that religion and political ideology is the mind of the organism.  I began to realize that depending on what state of consciousness or ideology humanity accepts will be the life cycle and function of the organism.  Then I began to realize this is the illusion of reality the Buddhist talk about.  Different religions have called this evolving organism different things.  Jesus called the organism the body of Christ.<br>
<br>
I then began to see history with a different view.  Nations falling and nations developing are actually different parts of the organism establishing itself as the equivalent of organs.  Nazi Germany was actually a part of the organism that tried establishing itself as the brain but the other parts of the organism did not recognize it as the brain because the physics of the earth were not in submission to Germany.<br>
<br>
I then realized the true nature of the system of Islam.  Islam is a program that’s entire purpose is to design the organism.  The Mosque is the think tank or brain of the organism, where all politics and economics are discussed.  The Quran is actually the physical programming of the organism.  The Quran is the social equivalent of DNA. It is a health standard that regulates every area of the organism and ensure that the organism never destroys itself but only destroy the “parasites” or “infidels” that seek to harm the overall benefit of the organism.<br>
<br>
I could not leave this state of thought. My friends tried to get me to rave with them; but I did not have any desire to party.  I lost interest in everything around me and began to write all the ideas that came to my mind.  During this entire time I did not leave my trance, but wrote for three hours straight.  I would have continued to write more but the drugs in combination with the emotions I was experiencing made it too difficult to continue.  Around 3:00 am I smoked enough marijuana to allow me to relax and lie down.<br>
<br>
I believe it was the combination of drugs, alcohol, summer heat, and the unfamiliar environment that created this unusual state of conscious in me.  It took one week for my mind to get back to its normal state and even now the psychological impact is with me.  This experience was in every since spiritual but just as dangerous as it was spiritual.<!--   End Body   -->

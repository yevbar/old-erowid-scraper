I have done many hours of research online where I learned all about morning glory seeds. I had read a couple trip reports on them and then I learned in one of them that they were just seeds you buy at the store. I went to a couple of stores but they all said they didn't sell seeds in the winter. I was disappointed so I pulled a jack move for some nutmeg but that’s a different less interesting story. I then stumbled across a website where you could order untreated seeds (no poison). I sent in my money for 25 grams of heavenly blues as I had heard they were the best variety. I went on vacation for Christmas and when I came back a small package was waiting for me in the mailbox. <br>
<br>
Two days later my parents are asleep and I whip out my seeds. I start counting them out to 50 and then made a bunch of piles of what looked like 50 although I am pretty sure most of them were more like 70. Any way I ate a bunch of seeds, about 200, very easily. I just chewed them up like that. I am now very comfortable on my bed covered in blankets and smoking a bowl. After about an hour after of ingesting the seeds I am feeling pretty blazed and didn't really notice the seeds too much. So I ate a lot more. I started feeling kind of sick but it went away. <br>
<br>
Minutes after eating all the seeds it hits me. My entire floor turns to squares and there are all sorts of patterns all over the floor. I am watching TV and things are moving all over the place swaying a round. I'm thinking all right this is pretty cool, I'm getting some visuals it's just like a hit or two of acid. Half an hour later it manifests into the most intense trip of my life and I have tripped hard before. I was not prepared for this I knew it would last many hours. I shouldn't have done this by myself. The whole night was me battling trying to maintain my sanity. Most of the trip reports I had read all sounded mild with little or no visuals.<br>
<br>
This was just a bizarre trip I can't describe what was happening. I tried to go to sleep for a little bit which was a bad idea. After closing my eyes I had many closed eye visuals which were all vivid frightening images of disfigured faces. I tried to convince my self that I was not that fucked up and that I was just chilling in my room trippin out. I must also mention that of all my trips this was the first time I had tripped alone. Basically I watched TV but it was so intense. There were patterns and colors flying at me from every direction. Every once in a while I would have a moment where I could just sit and try to enjoy it. But then the weirdest thing happened.<br>
<br>
I started hearing noises that were like alarms and sirens, all very loud, and everything on the TV seemed to be a message from god. I remember a commercial about strokes came on and I thought I was having one because of all the caffeine I had drank with the combination of these seeds that were making me jittery and shakey. I changed the channel and it was a church show another sign from god I thought. I started having this sensation that I was not breathing and now my body was getting tired while my mind was just tripping the fuck out. I started almost falling asleep but it didn't feel like sleeping it felt like I was about to die instead so I jumped awake really fast. All this while these increasingly faster and louder sirens were blaring. Then I realized all of the sounds were coming from the goddamn computer. <br>
<br>
I shut that shit off and felt better but I was still tripping just as hard. The whole time I thought I was dying was either because that the seeds actually did have poison or from dehydration. I then went out to the kitchen to get the first of many glasses of water. I drank so much water which made everything so much better. All this water made me have to take a piss many times. Every time I went to the bathroom I never glanced at the mirror or my dick because by this point I was seeing bugs crawling all over my room and myself. I went back to my room and the clock was changing numbers all the time, everything was breathing, there were still patterns all over the place. Then I saw some of the coolest visuals. One was a dragon fly that was flying around my room and it looked so real I grabbed to see if it was but then it disappeared. Also for a second right in front of my eyes a chair in my room transformed into a dog and then backed into the chair.<br>
<br>
Through out the night I kept drinking water and going to the bathroom which eventually woke up my parents. On one of my trips to go get water I saw my dad reading a book on the couch. I handled it like an OG and told him that I was sick and getting some water even though his face was all disfigured and had bugs crawling all over him. Then I felt better after talking to my dad and being able to handle so I sat in my bed and tripped hard as a mother fucker until the visuals started calming down at around 8 in the morning and I finally fell asleep. <br>
<br>
Overall this was not a positive experience because it was my first time with this substance. I was in a comfortable place but I was still alone and unprepared to trip this hard. And I was definitely not expecting to stay up all night off of these seeds. The peak probably lasted for about 6 hours so I was not able to get any sleep. The morning after there was no hangover or pain but I still felt kind of out of it. Another thing that contributed to the negativity of the trip was that I had fried pretty hard off of an 1/8th of some bomb shrooms only 5 or 6 days before and during the morning glory trip I decided I didn't feel like handling 2 trips in a short period.<!--   End Body   -->

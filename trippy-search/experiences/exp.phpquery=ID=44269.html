It all started about six-odd years ago. I was in a car accident which left me with two slipped discs in my lumbar (lower) spine, the pain was the worst I have ever felt, and has since turned me into a human barometer, whenever bad weather is coming my back let's me know, to the point where I had to sit with my back perfectly straight as to not sweat myself to death from the pain, but that's all besides the point.<br>
<br>
I've had a pain management doctor for about two or so years, I see him once a week to discuss how I'm coping with a permanent back injury, he gives me samples of new medications to see if they would help more then the others I used to take. Then as I turned 18 he started told me all about methadone and how it is usually an option to people in my situation. Little did I know how much I would have to go through to actually get to take a prescription home with me. <br>
<br>
Due to the fact that methadone is an opiate I had to go to a special clinic EVERY DAY (seven days a week), I had to sign in, show my insurance cards, 80 forms of ID, then my doctor had to be called. Then I would go into a closed doctor's office type room and I would be made to take the 1/4 tablet (10 mg starting dose) in front of the doctor, she would then check my mouth thoroughly to make sure I didn't cheek it. All in all this went on for a solid 50 days straight, my dosage was gradually upped, and I was handed my blue prescription for the 25 horse pills.<br>
<br>
As far as the effects, they took, and still take roughly 45 minutes for me to notice it coming on. My heart speeds up a little, and it puts me in an exceptionally good mood, most of the stuff I worry about on a daily basis seems to be forced into the back of my mind, not to mention the pain in my back actually lessens a substantial amount. At it's peak I have a lot more energy then usual, I'm up for doing stuff I usually don't like doing (cleaning, typing this, etc.). It also seems to help me fall asleep a lot easier then usual. All in all methadone has made dealing with pain a lot easier.<!--   End Body   -->

I had two extremely intense salvia trips. I mixed what I had left of the 20x into the 5x I had. I was absolutely blown away!! <br>
<br>
Trip 1: <br>
<br>
It wasn't until I was doing my second hit that I felt completely out of this world. It was an inner hallucination, in which objects didn't make sense to me. I looked at the bong and didn't know what it was, or what I was doing there, all I knew is I was trying to take another hit. My girlfriend had to help me because I was trying to torch the plastic. I had no idea where the bowl was, because I didn't understand the device. It made no sense. I was purely depending on previous routine to even have the ability to try lighting it. I didn't see my bong. All I saw was a blue thing standing there, like something out of Alice in Wonderland, or some kind of senseless fairy tale. After that, this feeling spread to the whole room. I saw my world as an abstract painting. I didn't understand the purpose or connection of anything.<br>
<br>
Visually, everything was as anyone else in their sober mind would see, but every edge, color and object in the room became complete confusion to my inner perception. I would compare it to looking through a kaleidascope, but not visually! Internally! I stood up, and felt like I was swimming through water. As I moved, the chaotic mess moved with me. For a second it felt like I was trying to 'walk away' from the trip. I'd sit back in a chair, stand up again, walk to another chair, stand up again. Then I sat next to my girlfriend, and didn’t understand why I was sitting, or what the chair meant. The intensity of this chaotic world to me was somewhat scary. My girlfriend was sitting in her chair occasionally watching me with a smile. Her face was the only thing in my vision that made sense. It was very comforting in a way. She tells me now that I got up and sat down several times. I felt like I was going insane. Not only that, I thought the insanity wouldn’t go away. I have never had such a wild alteration in my perception.<br>
<br>
I've learned so much about my brain. The brain is an amazing thing. I see it now as a filtering mechanism. It organizes what we see in front of us. Without that ability, everything in front of us is complete chaos, and for about 5 minutes, I saw that chaos.  This was so strange it was like an extremely intense dream.  I don't see it as an alteration of my current perception, but a real chaotic world that actually exists!!  I saw the world as it actually is without my brain organizing it.<br>
<br>
Trip 2: <br>
<br>
The first trip was so intense, I couldn't imagine doing another one on the same night, but my gf talked me into it (thank god!). She was telling me 'It’s different at night. The lights are off. You’ll be laying in my bed. It might be much different.' I didn't truly believe it at the time, but she is absolutely right. I got 2 good hits, and somehow managed to get part of a third one in, although I didn't have the mental capacity to hold this one in my lungs, I just remember coughing it out right away. I was already severely messed up! I was starting to feel the same affect. The chaotic mess. The lack of connection between objects. But then she turned off the lights.<br>
<br>
Wow! We had music playing this time. There was some kind of progressive techno song (I’ve never been into techno until last night!). Anyways this song was literally molding my world. A cheering audience sound gave me a funny 'circus' feeling. From that point on I was in a circus themed room that was constantly changing with the music. This circus theme stayed with me even onto the next trip-altering song (which I'll explain in a minute). <br>
<br>
The glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling were forming 'pockets' of space, in which I could see myself in each pocket, laying on the bed with my girlfriend. This wasn’t a physical visual effect, but rather an inner distortion of reality, which seems twice as fucked as anything I could possibly see. These pockets brought on such intensity to the ride, they shifted directions, and I had a feeling of moving through space with the music controlling it. The next song actually had an intercom-like female voice talking throughout the song as if your on a plane. Such a perfect song for this experience. Now it felt like I was on a techno pounding spaceship ride, with a plane-like intercom system, and the circus theme was still there as well. The stereo became the center of everything.  The green light was the only thing that gave me location of where the music was coming from, and so it became the absolute source of my new world, which only consisted of this beautiful spaceship flying through empty space. Everything centered around it, and so that’s where my sense of gravity was coming from. <br>
<br>
Yes, I truly believed at the time that gravity was actually coming from the stereo, and it spread out along the wall which I was laying next to. My world was 'sliding' horizonally across the room, as if I were actually melting across the tv, across the walls. It was an intense smearing effect I can’t quite describe. Very playful feeling, I couldn’t help but laugh out of pure giddyness. Then the song stopped, or died down or something, and I attentively listened to the silence as if my world had just stopped. The female voice (actually in the song) came on the intercom of my spaceship ride. She said something along the lines of about to change route, 'Sorry for your inconvenience' she said. I laughed out loud 'convenience!' Even though it was a giddy reaction, I completely understood that the ride was going to 'change course'. <br>
<br>
There was a point when I forgot I had a body!!! And when my girlfriend touched me all of a sudden, it felt as if my body was all of a sudden given birth to again, out of thin air. Being reminded that I had a body was so strange. My gf told me afterwards that when she touched me I acted as if I just got the wind knocked out of me! The feeling of being 'created' from the touch of a hand has to be the most intense feeling I’ve ever felt in my life.<br>
<br>
I gradually lost the feeling of being in a techno pounding spaceship, as the song started sloooowing down (which it actually does), I felt as if the spaceship was finally landing at its destination, on a runway, and the room was slowly becoming a 'room' again. I still can't believe that the song and the trip coexisted so well with each other. It was a harmony.<!--   End Body   -->

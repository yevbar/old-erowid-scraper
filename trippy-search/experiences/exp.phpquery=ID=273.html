I am a college student at Case Western, probably the most boring place in the world, and so one day, me and a friend decided to drink a bottle of cough syrup in an attempt to get fucked up.  We went to the store and looked at all the different types and found the one that contained the highest concentration of DXM, and didn't have anything else in it.  At about 6:30, I poured the whole bottle in a cup, closed my nose and pounded it down.  It wasn't as bad as I had expected, but the aftertaste was terrible and I couldn't get rid of it with cigarettes or alcohol.  After an hour or so, it started to kick in, so I decided to play some playstation to pass the time.  I began to get more and more fucked up.  I had techno playing on my computer with visualization effects, and the music sounded so good and the  visuals looked so cool.  It was too distracting and I had to stop playing playstation and went to see my friend who was almost passed out and neither of us could walk very well.<BR>
<BR>
Later on (I totally lost all concept of time), another friend came down and we smoked some bong hits, and the weed made the visuals kick in.  Everything started moving with wave-like motion, and it was nearly impossible to concentrate on anything.  I think I staggered around the dorm for a while and everyone who saw me said I looked more fucked up than they had ever seen anyone.  Finally, at 12:30 or 1, I laid down and found it surprisingly easy to fall asleep.  The next day I was very groggy and felt kind of stupid, but nothing like the night before.  I have done just about all the drugs there are, and I have to say that one five dollar bottle of cough syrup from the grocery store fucked me up more than anything else I have ever done.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes to trip.  I thought it was better than acid, because it was less of a mind fuck and wasn't so goddamn hard to get to sleep on.<!--   End Body   -->

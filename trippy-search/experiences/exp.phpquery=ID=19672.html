I am 15 yrs old and about a month a go I bought 10 grams of salvia for about £10. I was walking down to my friends house to smoke it when I saw there was a fire in the grassy land beside the road, and the police were stopping everyone from walking past. So I just waited with the other 4 or fire people that were there. The police asked to see our hands, presumably to see if they were dirty from building a fire, then they asked if anyone had any lighters or matches as they were going to search us. I had a lighter. I gave it the police, another man also had matches. The police then searched me and found me keys, some money, a socket gauze and the bag of salvia. OH CRAP, but its legal, right.<br>
<br>
The policeman asked me to sit in the police car while he searched the other people, he searched them then let them go. He then came into the car and asked me where I got it, I said the internet. He said do I know what it is, I said, it's Salvia Divinorum, a legal, Mexican herb. he said is wasn't salvia (he had never heard of it) and he claimed it was HEMP which I could plant and it would grow into a cannabis plant. He gathered this idea from the '----- Hemp Co' (Erowid Note: We do not publish vendor information in experience reports, so the whole name is not shown) label, simply ignoring the fact it said salvia. He then gave me a lecture about drugs and junkies and all that, then took me home.<br>
<br>
I don't smoke (in fact I hate it) and I do well at school (never into trouble) I got quite a big row and grounded for 2 weeks. The police took the salvia off me and said they would put it down the nearest drain. But I want to know if they had the right to do this. I never got a chance to smoke any of it. and I can't order more as my parents will want to inspect all parcels sent to me.<br>

A while back, a friend of mine bought a gram of 5-MeO-DiPT. Having done 5-Meo-DMT previously, I was looking forward to a great time. The only reason he bought this stuff was because it was ~$100 cheaper than the DMT. It's cheaper for a reason. And probably not because it's easier to make. So me and my friends (S and B) head over to my house to divide it and put it into pills.<BR>
<BR>
We start eyeballing lines, making sure to get them small and even (smaller than a 2C- hit). There is so much of the stuff that it starts getting into the air and I get a small buzz from dividing out most of it. When it is in the capsules, I take roughly 10 mg. As soon as I start getting a buzz, I also get very sick.<BR>
<BR>
I can't throw up so I just sit there on the couch in agony for the next four hours. All I did the whole time was watch TV and wish I hadn't taken this stuff. I'm glad it doesn't last as long as 2C-. This stuff messes me up but it's not really psychedelic. No real open-eye hallucinations, everything just looks shaky. It does something strange to my  hearing, like my head is underwater. The feeling it gives in my head isn't really pleasant, it's basically a headache. I realized that just because something has a 5-MeO on it doesn't make it good. <BR>
<BR>
After taking this crap, I waited about 6 months before taking it again and still had an awful time when I did it.<!--   End Body   -->

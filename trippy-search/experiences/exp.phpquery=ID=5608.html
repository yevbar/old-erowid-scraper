Its now saturday morning, I'm still tripping off a dose of amt I took at 9 last night, 15 hours so far and its been great.<BR>
<BR>
I got a few doses of amt from a friend of mine which came in the form of a putrid smelling powder, I put a few doses in gel caps and took 1 at around 9 on friday night with a friend. I had skipped dinner because i heard you can get nausa and stomach discomfort, so all i had eaten was a sandwhich at about 1 o'clock that day. <BR>
<BR>
Within the first hour I could begin to feel the effects, slight upset stomach, but it went away as quickly as it came. Starting with the second hour and going on the whole trip a general sence of euphoria was strong. What ever music was playing was great to listen to. Although I could feel the euphoria my general mental state was mildly tripping, but clear headed, no visuals yet. At this point the setting is a bumping party, contrary to what i read on some of the trip reports, amt is an exelent recreational drug!! <BR>
<BR>
Once 4 oclock rolled around (T+7) we decided to smoke some weed. This was probably the best thing we couldve done, the synergy between the amt and the weed worked soo amazingly together. Within minutes after smoking I got intense visuals, not so much closed eye, but amazing open eye hallucinations. I have tripped off acid a few times before, but never got visuals like I did with the amt. From the point we smoked weed till around 4 hours later the peak of my trip was being experienced. At some points I would just be looking at the tile floor melt and move around, then all of a sudden I felt like I was rolling. I got the strong euphoria and even the eye jiggles. Although its still not done yet I would rate my amt experience as the best drug experience I've had. Although very close in second would have to be rolling. <BR>
<BR>
Overall this trip has been really good. Mental alertness lasting throughout the trip (execept around T+12hrs, but a short nap recharged me) good euphoria, and coupled with weed a strong trip full of crazy visuals. I would recomend this to anyone who likes tripping and rolling, just be sure you have a place to be when you start peaking as your sure to sound ridiculous. This is not the kind of drug i try just by myself, cause when your tripping 15+ hours its good to have someone else whos going through the same thing.<BR>
<BR>
This is especially true if the amt is taken at night, because when its 7 oclock the next morning and your still tripping balls, many people who arent on it will pass out, so this way youll have some company. This is definaltly something i would like to do again, probably the same dose...but not for a while. Even though I've had a great time the whole way through, tripping 18 hours can take a toll on you, so i'd wait a while before i tried it again. If you can come by any AMT i highly recomend it, prepare yourself for a big trip mentally and youll have the time of your life.<!--   End Body   -->

I made a tea with a bag of Kava Kava and a bag of Calea. I filled a 36 Oz Emptied fruit bottle out, threw in the kava and the calea and some tea bags. Put in hot water and shook it up like mad. After an hour or so we drained the stuff out. Word had been going around that I had some herbs that gave you dreams and I had friends asking left and right for tea. I posted my first experience, and I'm going to give somewhat detailed experiences of my friends. (The 36 WRETCHEDLY tasting ounces went in a day in a half :)).<BR>
<BR>
----------------------------------<BR>
Myself - <BR>
3 bowls smoked (Calea) - Vivid realistic dream that I mistook for reality the next day.<BR>
2 joints and a cup of my tea mixture - I had a dream of smoking out my dorm window and getting in trouble with authorities. Never happened yet I thought it did for a while the next day.<BR>
<BR>
3 cups of my tea - Nothing on day one, I was somewhat euphoric and relaxed, I kept dropping objects and couldn't stop questioning reality, but the next day I had a hardcore dream with odd events, but I forgot what happened since I fell back a sleep after I woke up in the middle of the dream<BR>
<BR>
----------------------------------<BR>
Participant 1 -<BR>
2 Joints (Calea) also with previous THC use - Noticed clearer thoughts, he had sex with his girlfriend in his dream, and when he woke up, stunned she wasn't next to him and then realized it was a dream, so realistic he ejaculated in his pants while sleeping.<BR>
<BR>
About 2 Cups of the tea and some THC use - He became extremely hyper, took a tab and ended up never sleeping.<BR>
<BR>
----------------------------------<BR>
Participant 2 -<BR>
1 Joint and a large cup of tea - We both noticed not being cold in cold weather for about 40 minutes. He slept, felt that he had a lot of dreaming but didn't remember anything.<BR>
<BR>
----------------------------------<BR>
Participant 3 -<BR>
One cup of tea (mixed with Chocolate Milk to wash down, not bad) - Had a vivid dream that he could create a blue portal and teleport to any location he wanted to.<BR>
<BR>
----------------------------------<BR>
Participant 4 - <BR>
A cup and a little more - Never mentioned anything to me about dreaming, but he actually liked the taste of Calea and Kava mixed! Two of quite possibly the worst tasting herbs.<BR>
<BR>
----------------------------------<BR>
Participant 5 - <BR>
A little less than a cup - She claimed her dream to be very mind purifying. It consisted of her being back in Middle school in a sewer area with flowers everywhere. Her friend who had commited suicide in high school talked to her in the sewer.<BR>
<BR>
----------------------------------<BR>
Participant 6 - <BR>
THC, a little alcohol, and my Tea - Nothing.<BR>
<BR>
----------------------------------<BR>
Participant 7 -<BR>
Tea - Probably dreamt, but couldn't remember anything<BR>
<BR>
----------------------------------<BR>
Participant 8 -<BR>
Tea - Just drank some<BR>
----------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
Don't ask me what caused me to mix Kava and Calea, I had both herbs lying around and I was quite bored. Me and Part. 2 decided to make a bit of tea and we liked it. It made us feel warm in the cold, and relaxed. My friend's hip pain was completely unevident.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, I liked the mix. I drank three cups over a period of three hours. I noticed my eyelids force closing after exerting my body, and I would drop stuff as if I had been up for a few days straight.<BR>
<BR>
Music was noticably better, I was very relaxed. Later in the night I started going crazy, as if I was watching everything from a movie. I couldn't stop questioning reality. The night had been very wierd, and I couldn't help having thoughts like, maybe the world is all in my head, and since I drank the tea thats why everything is wierded out. I didn't feel too messed up, but when I woke up in the morning remembering the night before I noticed a bit of a change.<BR>
<BR>
From what I noticed, the Kava might make it harder to sleep, but it may just be that anticipation of dreaming that keeps me up. But the relaxation of the Calea, and the Kava effects mix well for a night you don't have anything to do on. Almost like a tranquilizing effect. I also noticed it doesn't really matter how long you take the Calea before sleep to really make a difference. In fact, most of the best experiences came from drinking the tea earlier in the day.<BR>
<BR>
I hope this sheds some light on this underated herb. I plan on buying a lot of Calea and running some somewhat proffesional tests on Calea, making sure no one mixes any other drugs with it, how long they wait to sleep etc.<!--   End Body   -->

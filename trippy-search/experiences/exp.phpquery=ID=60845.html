I consider myself to be a highly experienced psychonaut, I've had hundreds of experiences with 2C-I, 2C-E, 5-MeO-AMT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-DMT, DOC, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-AcO-MiPT, mushrooms, ayahuasca, LSA, amanita mushrooms, yopo, and I was looking forward to this new tool to add to the bag.<br>
<br>
The powder itself was composed of a very fine, clay-coloured texture.  I was somewhat saddened all that is available is fumarate salts, my suspicion is that it’s used as a cutting agent to add weight to the molecule.  It also makes it more difficult to determine proper dose.  After adding up the molecular weights, I determined the powder was 66% ethocin freebase by weight, so 21mg fumarate = 14mg freebase, and I'd heard that ~15mg is appropriate.<br>
<br>
I've now experimented with this a few times, enough to gain a good understanding of what the experience is and what it has to offer, as well as good dosing strategies.  The experience itself comes on about 1.5 hours after consuming it, and the peak continues for approximately 3 hours.  The experience it produces is highly conducive for meditation.  It's not a warm feeling, but its a loving feeling, the connections felt with other people aren't so much physical or personal, but rather spiritual.<br>
<br>
One of the highlights of this compound is the visual nature it produces.  It’s rich with both CEV's as well as OEV's.  The OEV's come on strong after 15-16mg, after that, there is a steep dosage-response curve.  The OEV's take the form of energy currents and distribution.  Shadows appear and disappear, and a steady strobing effect is present in the peripheries.  I wish I could remember more about the tracer-factor this drug produces, but they seemed to have a unique characteristic to them that made them different from 2C-E tracers or mushroom tracers.  All things seem to meld together into a single form and then stretch.<br>
<br>
The CEV's are highly colored, geometric, complex, and synaesthetic.  One night, I felt myself slip into a meditative trance, and with my eyes closed, I slipped out of my body into infinite space.  I was curled up like a fetus, and the world around me was composed of digital grids.  As I moved further down into it, I saw two hearts beating in the grid, and I descending down between them.  As this was happening, I was aware of my breathing becoming slower and slower until it had stopped completely, and as I got right up on the figures, my cat had made his way over to me and was frantically trying to get my attention.  As soon as I re-opened my eyes, he lost interest and walked away.  <br>
<br>
Another characteristic of this and similar compounds my friends and I have found is that they seem to have a special ability of attracting non-physical beings/energies.  It constantly feels as though some sort of entity is present, what I can't say is whether or not they seem hostile.  I've never felt threatened by them.  It almost seems as though they're interested in what we're doing, they're just standing around observing us.  In a way, it feels like the visions are a production of their presence, a form of mental communication.<br>
<br>
There isn't really any body-load experienced during any of the trips.  The closest thing is leg tremors.  The experience doesn't feel sinister, either, like 4-AcO-DMT.  The visuals are mostly friendly, warm, and entertaining.  It makes everything look so modern and plastic, like its vibrant.  And if I focus my attention on any one spot,  I can make it do almost anything.<!--   End Body   -->

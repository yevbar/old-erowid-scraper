This is going to be a little hard to explain since what I experienced was completely alien to me.  My drug experience consists of a fair amount of pot, 2 acid trips (one of which was mind-blowing), and 3 times I've tried mushies with limited success.<BR>
<BR>
I packed a nicely sized cone of Salvia, and proceeded to smoke (what I thought was) almost the whole cone, keeping it in for 15-20 secs - went really hard.<BR>
<BR>
What happened next is very hard to describe.  I'll try and put in to words what seemed like what going on to me, and then I'll tell you how I appeared to my friends.  Please note that putting this into words really does not do this any justice whatsoever.<BR>
<BR>
The onset was _very_ fast.  Total confusion.  It was as if someone had opened up my head, scrambled all the nerve connections in my brain, and put my conciousness somewhere else entirely.  I had little concept of what was going on around me, my vision was completely fucked.<BR>
<BR>
Lost all concept of time and space.  Blended into my surroundings to the point where I didn't know where I started and the rest of my environment stopped.<BR>
<BR>
I basically became one with everything, I think.  I felt like I was losing grip, and I tried to counter-act it.  I slowly began to blend out of my surroundings.  All of this was very, and I mean _very_ odd.  When I turned it felt like there was a wall attached to me, then boxes, everything... it was so utterly fucked that I can't really explain it.<BR>
<BR>
Slowly I began to recognise faces, fleeting glimpses of reality.  Not long after that I could talk and stuff, and knew where I was etc, but I was still feeling very odd for quite a while - up to an hour after I'd smoked the cone.  I don't know how else to describe what I felt now other than feeling very weird, still getting blending sensations, turning.<BR>
<BR>
What I experienced was so completely alien to me that my reality and the way I processed information was totaly changed to the point that it was unrecognisable.  I literally lost my mind, I was not thinking straight in any way shape or form.  It wasn't until about 10 minutes after the ordeal that I began to learn what I was actually doing here on planet earth.<BR>
<BR>
First of all, I didn't smoke 'nearly one cone', I had a cone and a little more, but I don't actually remember that.  My friends said that just after I put the pipe down a look of total wide-eyed confusion struck my face, and my face went bright red.  Keeping in mind I have no recollection of any of these events, this is all what I've been told.  I fell off the sofa, and pulled myself up on the coffee table to try and balance myself, and apparently was trying to climb up onto the thing.<BR>
<BR>
I then started to spasm uncontrolably.  It wasn't an uncoordinated<BR>
movement, my body knew exactly what it was doing and was determined to do it, even if my mind was unaware.  I was turning over and over with great speed and force.  I knocked a bucket half full of water all the way across<BR>
the room, spraying water for fucking miles.  I broke a plate that was on the table.<BR>
<BR>
If it wasn't for my friend grabbing me and forcing me against the sofa, I would have damaged some very expensive lighting equipment that was on the<BR>
garage floor.  If I'd been much bigger or stronger, things could have got very messy indeed, that's for fucking sure.<BR>
<BR>
As I was turning around and around on the ground, I was smashing my knee against the concrete floor incredibly hard, over and over and over.  I somehow smacked my head, and have a nice big cut on it.   It took me a while to realise that my knee was actually sore, but I could still walk on it.  I looked very pale afterwards, and felt cold.  This morning I could hardly even move it let alone put any weight on it, so I went into A&E and had some X-rays done - nothing broken, just bruised bone.<BR>
<BR>
I had a friend with me that night who had done Salvia with friends before,<BR>
but had not experienced nor seen anyone else experience anything anywhere near what I did with this drug.<BR>
<BR>
I put what happened down to my own stupidity in not doing any research before taking a drug which resulted in amoung one of the most profound (albeit short-lived) moments in my entire life.  Needless to say it has definately taught me a lesson.  I went into it too light-hearted, and got what I deserved.<!--   End Body   -->

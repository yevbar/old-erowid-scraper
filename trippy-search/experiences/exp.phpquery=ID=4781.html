It was a Saturday night, and I had just gotten off the phone with my girlfriend, who upset me quite a bit.. Because of this, and the thought of the boring night, I decided to try something new (being upset is no reason to do drugs, I am just stupid) I have never done Vicodin before, and I knew my parents had some left over from various injuries, so I went into the cabinet and got 2 7.5/750 tablets and brought them to my room. There, after reading about Hydrocodone on the web, I decided to snort one. I ground the pill up with my mortar & pestle (I am a child of chemistry), took my pen, and snorted it up into my nose. There were no really noticeable effects. After about a minute, I decided to crush up the other pill. I did, and began to inhale this into my nose. After about half of the powder was gone, my nose filled up so much that I really couldn’t breathe through it that good, so I waited about 10 minutes for it to be absorbed. <BR>
<BR>
During this time I became bored. This is not good because when I get bored I do stupid stuff.. Time to search for the whipped-cream can to inhale some nitrous... We were all out. I went back up to my room, sat down and started to think. I looked around my room, at my hanging Christmas lights, and at my black light.. Then my eyes saw the can of 'Enviro-Duster' and I remembered seeing 'Computer Duster' under the inhalants section in Erowid.<BR>
<BR>
I have always been totally against 'huffing' and cheap highs, but despite the warnings on Erowid, I said what the hell, and gave it a shot. I put the tube in my fist, and i put my fist up to my nose.. I pulled the trigger and inhaled the chemical directly. I put it down, and began to feel extremely dizzy, then my vision became very distorted, and I felt like I was spinning around with the world.. Great. I began to go on a 'duster binge' which I named it last night. I took another hit, and it was better then the first. I stumbled to my bed, and stared at the hanging lights with awe. I needed more, I took another big hit and then over AIM I proceeded to type 'omg' to my friend because I had such a big rush. When this wore off, of course, I needed more. I took another, and then another. Before the last hit wore off, I started smelling more.. For about 15 seconds i blew it into my nose.. Then put it down, and very quickly snorted the second half of the second pill. I was f-u-c-k-e-d up. <BR>
<BR>
I laid on my bed with my eyes closed, everything spinning. I began to dislike the feeling. I stood up and went to my computer. I typed to my friend 'that’s enough duster for me, I feel sick now' right as I typed enter, I got that feeling in my stomach, accompanied by the salivating of my mouth. I ran to the bathroom, put the shower on because my mom was sleeping in the next room over, and started to puke out my guts. <BR>
<BR>
After splashing toilet water all over my face, and in my mouth, I flushed the toilet and washed up. I stumbled to my room and kicked the can of 'duster' off my chair. About 10 minutes went by, and again, I was in my bathroom throwing up. I was catching my breath, when the phone rang. I ran out of the bathroom into my room with vomit and toilet water on my face to get the phone so my mom wouldn’t wake up.. I sounded horrible. 'Helllooo' I said.. It was my girlfriend.. She asked me what was wrong and I told her.. 'oh no why would you do that babe'.. I went to my bathroom and cleaned up. <BR>
<BR>
It was about 10:15 now and I was still feeling horrible. I talked to her on the phone for about 15 minutes, laying in my bed with my eyes closed.. Then, I stood up to put some mp3's on, and I felt it again. I ran to the bathroom, put the phone on mute (by her request, heh) and vomited again, this time not that much, just heaving into the toilet). I once again picked the phone up 'Helllooo'. I was feeling a little better, so I went down stairs to get some food. I ate a little bite of left over pizza, but started feeling sick again, so I went back up stairs. I lay in my bed. I then got out of bed for some reason, and again, began to feel sick. I ran to the bathroom, put the phone on mute, and again I threw up, even less this time, with painful heaves. <BR>
<BR>
I picked up the phone, and again I sounded horrible. 'Why would you do this' she asked, I replied by saying, 'I was upset.. And bored' we then talked about why I was upset and sorted it all out. I was laying down, but stood up to get my yearbook to look for somebody in it, and again I felt like I was going to 'hurl' so I ran into the bathroom and after about 30 seconds I put the phone on mute and threw up. Nothing but a mouth full came out, with more painful heaves. I ran into my room after cleaning up and lay down. I figured out that every time I stood up, I felt sick and threw up. I wouldn’t get up anymore; I lay in my bed until 4:00am on the phone with her, talking.<BR>
<BR>
I had a HORRIBLE night. I think it was the computer duster that made me vomit, I will never do something like that again.. As I puked I blew a lot of the white paste out of my nose.. Intentionally. My advice to anyone that huffs is, grow up, it’s a stupid high that kills neurons. And as for the Vicodin, I don’t know.. I will never snort it again.. Because I really didn’t get any results. But maybe some day I will take them orally. Not anytime soon for that matter. Being upset is no reason to take any drugs, when I get upset I do stupid things.<BR>

[3:06am]  <BR>
'This is what is meant by 'ecstasy'.  They should have just told us this; they should've printed it in one of Shulgin's books.'<BR>
<BR>
I recently had the privilege of experiencing 2C-T-7 and MDMA concurrently.<BR>
The following are my impressions of the evening:<BR>
<BR>
[10:20pm] <BR>
Ate 28mg gelcap of 2C-T-7.  At the advice of practically everyone I'd talked to, I made sure my stomach was good and empty. Watched my friends each take some pure MDMA dissolved in water.<BR>
<BR>
[10:25pm] <BR>
The MDMA began to work on my friends.  Wow, that was fast. <BR>
<BR>
[11:30pm] <BR>
Felt some twinges like the 2C-T-7 was beginning to hit me. Decided to stave off any nausea which could result from the 2C-T-7 by smoking a bunch of kind bud.<BR>
<BR>
[12:00am] <BR>
Felt some body effects and slightly increased persistence of vision.  I'd call this T+0 for the 2C-T-7.  Smoked some more pot.<BR>
<BR>
[12:30am] <BR>
By this point I'd been waiting two hours and I'd felt anxious and right on the edge of tripping for half an hour.  When does this shit come up?<BR>
<BR>
[12:50am] <BR>
Set myself down on a nice mattress, listened to some techno, closed my eyes, and THERE it is.  With a little imagination, I was saturated in closed-eye visuals; endless patterns of images I could decipher at any point, all changing rapidly and bouncing in time with the music.  The music itself demonstrated amazing depth and tone; I could deconstruct any unertone or backbeat in the air, recognizing many patterns and features of the songs I'd never noticed before. Oh, and I chewed a pen cap into oblivion.  Jaw-clenches.  Yeah.<BR>
<BR>
[1:30am] <BR>
For forty minutes I'd steeped, swum, and explored in a mental seascape of music, rhythm, and my subconscious.  It all felt very controllable and very positive.  Once I determined the trip was going to be a great time, I decided to go for the gusto.  125mg MDMA (aq)...gulp.<BR>
<BR>
[2:00am] <BR>
Good Christ.  The E had hit me like a 10lb mini-sledge to the skull, so 2am saw me rolling like crazy and tripping balls to boot.  Open-eye visuals present; mostly trails and persistence of images, but also a lot of general wonder at the world around me.  Closed-eye visuals were still quite strong.<BR>
<BR>
[3:00am] <BR>
After listening to more good music, I was awash in a sea of fruity goodness.  I found myself quite introspective; instead of just the carefree ass-kicking trip of the 2C-T-7, there was added a layer of emotional probing and pondering the incredible dynamic of the people around me.<BR>
<BR>
[4:20am] !<BR>
<BR>
[4:45am] <BR>
Ventured out in search of food with some friends.  I wasn't wearing shoes, so I knew I'd be booted from the diner quicker than you could say 'ringworm'.  I didn't particularly care; wasn't it enough to just walk in the gorgeous pre-dawn haze?  The street lights were radiant, and the construction sites and deserted streets and fog looked like a scene from Blade Runner.  also popped some Prozac. <BR>
<BR>
[5:00am] <BR>
Kicked out of the diner.  :)  I walked home in wide-eyed wonder at the wonderful world around me.<BR>
<BR>
[5:30am] <BR>
Upon returning home, I'd no sooner gone to my room than I managed to embed a good-sized (2mm per side?) cube of glass in my left heel.  After trying unsuccessfully to remove it by hand, I proceeded to the bathroom to remove it using a knife.  Now, normally this would be a chore I'd begrudgingly accept (comes with the barefoot territory), but I found the task positively engrossing---pleasant, even.  With a slight smile and a splash or two of gore, I scooped out the offending hunk of glass and decided to put some socks on.<BR>
<BR>
[6:00am] <BR>
The effects of the 2C-T-7 are pretty much done with, and the E  was in its bug-out-neurotic-no-sleep-zombie stage.  Sleep?  Heh.  Sure. I smoked some more weed instead.<BR>
<BR>
[7:00am] <BR>
I finally felt calm enough to get into bed.<BR>
<BR>
[~8:00am] <BR>
Dozed off, and had a reasonably ok 'night' of sleep.<BR>
<BR>
End Note: <BR>
Sometime in the morning, as humans are wont to do, I peed. While gazing relievedly into the urinal, I saw superimposed over the several-hole drain grafitti in the pattern of the word 'LUCKY'. Judging from this and the general character of the trip, I'd have to call this 'lucky-flipping'.<!--   End Body   -->

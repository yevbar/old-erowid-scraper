<FONT COLOR="#CC9900">Erowid Note: We're assuming the material described in this report is methamphetamine, though the author only describes it as 'speed'.  The doses described are quite high and would be dangerous in a new user who has not developed tolerance. The material was likely quite impure.</font><BR>
<BR>
I was at an outdoor dance party in the South Island of New Zealand. It was in an amazing location, surrounded by multitudes of interesting rock outcrops, cliffs and caves. These not only looked cool but enhanced the auditory effects of the music. <BR>
<BR>
The rave was rather intimate, with a focus on personal expression and freedom, the message was 'Dance, communicate, evolve, enjoy'. It had a very good vibe about it and everyone seemed to be having a great time. A wide range of music was being played in three zones, from live dub / drum n bass, to house, techno, trance and others. <BR>
<BR>
Even though I had spent the previous night on MDMA, shrooms and speed, I had taken serotonin boosters and rested for the day, feeling in a good body and mind set for the second night of raving. <BR>
<BR>
8:00 PM - Ate a light meal of fruit, bread and vegetables to give my body some essential nutrients for the night ahead.<BR>
<BR>
11:30 PM - Ingested a capsule containing 20mg 2C-I, and went down to the dance area. Danced to some Drum N Bass for a while.<BR>
<BR>
12:20 AM - Feeling the effects of the 2C-I coming on now. My body feels good, it feels relaxed, warm and my limbs move freely. The music is 'sinking in' to my mind more, as though it is saturating my head and my mind.<BR>
<BR>
12:40 AM - I snort 150mg of (impure) speed and continue dancing.<BR>
<BR>
12:50 AM - I'm now feeling nicely high, and thoroughly enjoying the drum n bass which is getting quite fast and bassy. I'm fully focused on dancing, and the vibe is absolutely amazing. Being surrounded by so many other people dancing feels good, I feel like they are my friends even though I don't know most of them. Dancing with plenty of energy. Feeling pretty hot and needing a good supply of water to avoid dehydration, sweating a lot (from the dancing rather than drugs I suspect)<BR>
<BR>
1:30 AM - One of my favourite drum n bass DJ's is coming on so I snort another 200mg of speed. Feeling totally full of energy, having a great time, very high yet still mentally alert. Visuals from the 2C-I developing nicely. Strong neon logos appearing before me quite vividly. This is already a night to remember.<BR>
<BR>
2:30 AM - The DJ's set finishes and I move to another zone, where they are playing some old-school trancey techno. Still totally buzzing, fully into the music and the vibe, I have a great time trancing out to this music and in my mind I can understand that these musical patterns are audio representations of the patterns of the governing systems of our reality. I am so focused on the trance that all of my thoughts and memories of reality outside of this moment dissapear. I am now in a full trance state, with my dancing being a physical representation of these sounds which are presented to me. Eventually, I reach an extremely ecstatic state of heightened awareness which feels orgasmic to both the mind and the body. <BR>
<BR>
For the rest of the night I continued to dance in the different zones to various styles of electronica. I gained an appreciation for each style, using them for different shamanic purposes. For instance, I thought about how the different styles of music can be viewed as different 'magnifications' of the same overall thing. As an example, one bar of drum n bass can represent a single bass beat in a trance track, etc. And when I explore the different magnifications of reality I am engulfed by the sense of infinity. Infinite time, infinity joy, infinite life, infinite death. An overall yin-yang vibe came into play and raised my good feelings even further. Thinking now becoming pretty much totally abstracted from 'sober' reality. I danced until past dawn and when I went back to my tent at 8:30 AM I was still mentally alert and awake, but my body needed a break. <BR>
<BR>
SUMMING UP: I found this combo of 2C-I and speed to be an excellent mix for a dance party. The 2C-I played the major role in the night, increasing my abilities to interpret the music in the ways that I did, and elevating my mood to a state of ecstacy. The addition of the speed gave me the boundless energy which allowed me to play these thoughts out by dancing as hard as I wanted to. I've been to a lot of dance parties and taken many different drugs, and I would have to say that this night would be in the top 5 for me, thanks both to the music and this great drug combination.<!--   End Body   -->

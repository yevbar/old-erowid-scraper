For the past 2 years, I have been consistently prescribed oxycodone – in various forms – for a broken back, the subsequent surgery, and post-surgical pain.  I have developed quite a tolerance as you might imagine, requiring over 200mg a day to alleviate the pain.  I also misused the prescription, insufflating them to get high.  It was great until my tolerance built up and the amount required to be high became huge.<br>
<br>
As a result, I would burn through my prescriptions (amount prescribed: 2 – 20mg Oxycontin/day; 4 – 15mg Roxicodone/day) in about a week.  I’d go through withdrawal over and over again when my script ran out.  I actually got pretty used to it!  Good at it, more like it.  At least, after a while, it didn’t seem so bad, especially with tapering off a bit beforehand.<br>
<br>
To the point of this report:  I had been off the opiates for about a week and was doing pretty well.  I was finally sleeping fairly well at night but still was anxious, especially in the morning, along with some of the annoying but treatable gastrointestinal problems.  Looking for a way to ease the anxiety without resorting to another addictive substance like benzodiazepines, I decided to try Skelaxin, a muscle relaxant that I had also been prescribed for muscle spasms.<br>
<br>
Skelaxin always worked terrifically for me for the spasms.  It took care of the problems and didn’t make me sleepy.  As a result of having swallowed several of these over the past year, I didn’t have much hope that it would relieve any of the anxiety symptoms.  The worst of these for me was an annoying tightening of muscles and shaking.  I had tried taking the Skelaxin – swallowing them – to alleviate these symptoms to no avail.  Thus, I thought that perhaps a different method of ingestion might work better.  Immediately, I went to my old standby for recreational pill use – insufflation.<br>
<br>
I sat down and carved up half of an 800mg Skelaxin pill, expecting to have to take many more to get any relief for the anxiety.  I was surprised to find that after snorting the 400mg within the span of about 10 minutes that I was beginning to feel much more relaxed.  Finally, Skelaxin resembled other muscle relaxants like Soma and Flexeril.  The “body high” – which for me was more or less a relief of the anxiety plus a bit more relaxation – was very similar to these other two drugs.  It lasted for about 3 hours!  Another big surprise.<br>
<br>
Overall, I’d say that my experience with snorting Skelaxin was very positive.  It alleviated my anxiety symptoms effectively and provided an additional, pleasant, more recreational body high.  The only drawback that I could foresee is that taking more might make one nauseous.  I experienced a bit of this shortly after snorting the 400mg but it disappeared rather quickly.  I would also plan on not having anything physical (or perhaps mental) for the duration of the high, since it is a muscle relaxant and effectively turned me into a “couch lump”, having difficulty moving, feeling heavy, etc.  Aside from these few things, Skelaxin was effective for me both for the treatment of some opiate-withdrawal related anxiety and for the generation of a pretty decent body high.<!--   End Body   -->

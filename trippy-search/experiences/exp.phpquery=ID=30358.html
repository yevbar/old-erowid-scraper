Previous to the experience, I had done shrooms once before, to the tune of around 3 grams. It was a trip, to be sure, but it was mostly just recreational - I didn't learn anything from it really, and only felt emotionally and physically exhausted afterwards. The reasons behind this are many, poor setting, no sitter, ingested over a LONG period of time, etc.<br>
<br>
This time, I had just a little bit of mushrooms left over from the previous experience. I estimate it to be around a half gram. I chewed it up around 6pm and held it in my mouth for a minute or so, then swallowed. They really don't taste all that bad, they certainly don't taste great, but they’re bearable. After dosing, I ate a bowl of soup with my mom and couldn't finish it even though I was pretty hungry prior to eating the shrooms. I told my mom I wasn’t hungry anymore and headed upstairs to my room and put on some comfortable music.<br>
<br>
I'll save you the trouble of reading in depth about the typical shroom effects, and instead just quickly summarize. Breathing felt *great*. I would take a deep breath and I could feel it filling my entire body. It felt as if each breath was the best breath I have ever taken. Music sounded great, as usual. Even at this small dose, I saw some small visual distortions on my computer screen - mostly just wavy images.<br>
<br>
On to the important part. Within probably an hour of ingesting the shrooms, I got fairly contemplative. I thought about my life, and how incredibly fortunate I was to live in such a wonderful situation. I live in a great house, I have *very* caring parents, I have a job that I like, I do well in school, I have a lot of friends, and I'm an accomplished athlete. I thought about all of this and it just completely overwhelmed me. Before this, I knew I was well off, but this experience REALLY made me grateful for my situation. I felt tremendous gratitude towards my parents for giving me this life and for raising me to become who I am now. I also realized that I often just take all of this for granted, and I vowed that in the future I would try and be more appreciative towards my parents, and also just towards *anyone* who goes out of their way to be nice to me.<br>
<br>
Also, I thought a lot about my drug use. I'm not a heavy druggie, but I've tried a lot of the recreational drugs. I came to the conclusion that it is okay for me to experiment with drugs as long as I do it in a safe situation and I know what I'm getting into, but that it is EXTREMELY important that I don't let my drug use negatively effect myself or anyone else. Most importantly, I felt that I had to make sure that I never put myself in a situation where my parents would become aware of my drug use (anything beyond alcohol). I know that they would be very disapointed and the mushrooms made me realize how horrible this would be - I felt like I never would want to do anything that would disapoint them. I felt I should always be grateful to them for everything they have done for me, and that if I was to use drugs I should use them responsibly and I should always try to be kind to my parents.<br>
<br>
Overall, I was shocked at how much of a trip I got from only about a half gram. The lessons I learned on this trip I still carry with me (2 months later), and I now am always careful to thank people when they are friendly and nice. I also try to be more kind to other people, and most of all, I don't take anything for granted anymore. When I sit down to the dinner table and look at the wonderful meal I have in front of me, I am *truly* grateful. These mushrooms really changed my outlook on life.<!--   End Body   -->

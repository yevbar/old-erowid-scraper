<!--   Start Body   -->


I would consider myself an avid smoker. I had been getting high since I was 14 and had never stopped for more than a period of a few months. At the time of the instance in question, I was 19 and I had been smoking quite frequently - almost a gram/day - and had also been drinking as well as experimenting with other substances. I had never really endured a seriously bad trip with any drugs, be it alcohol, hash, speed, etc. and I had definitely never imagined that weed of all things would be the drug to push me over the edge.<br>
<br>
A couple years ago, I had considerably my only 'bad' experience with weed. It wasn't very severe, nor did it last never long. I had smoked a session with a couple of my girl friends and we had began to walk to my other friend's house. On the walk there I immediately felt the effects kick in, however it was much more intense then anything before. I felt I was slipping in and out of a dream state. Like one minute I would feel as if everything happening around me was just a dream, and the next I would 'wake up' and feel momentarily 'sober'. This cycled for about 2 hours. It wasn't necessarily unpleasant, just very unusual. I had a mild panic attack, fearing I couldn't distinguish reality from this dream state. But I never acted out or even said anything to my friends. This was the only strange experience I'd had with weed up to date.<br>
<br>
Last night however, I had gone out to meet a friend and smoke a J before going to bed. This was a typical habit as I had been meeting up with him and smoking several times a week now. He had already rolled the weed (about a gram I'd say) and we began smoking it in the cold, outside an old school. Everything seemed normal, and I had smoked about 1/2 the joint, which was usual. I felt disappointed at first as my friend was clearly feeling the effects, while I hadn't been hit with any of the high. I guess my first mistake was underestimating this feeling. I took a few more hard tokes and decided that I just wasn't in any condition to feel the high (this sometimes happens to me, I just plain don't get high even off of good weed and a good amount). My second mistake was probably my decision to smoke at all that night. I had been nursing a bad hangover all day as well as feeling the after effects of some hash smoked the night before as well as some seriously laced weed. My body had been weak and my stomach and head felt upset most of the day. However by the time I had met up with my friend I felt normal and figured smoking would merely put me to sleep.<br>
<br>
About 30 minutes after smoking I began to feel a really strong high. It was a fun high, nothing out of the ordinary. My buddy and I always have really awesome highs and trips and I trust him more than anyone, especially when it comes to drugs. We were talking about philosophy when I suddenly felt a rush throughout my body. It was like a wave of cold starting from my feet and becoming growingly more intense as it reached my head. Everything felt weird. I started feeling a bit dizzy and my balance started to weaken. Its odd though: the conversation continued completely normal and my speech as well as my mental processing weren't affected while this body rush was happening. The last thing I remember was this feeling overwhelming my entire body.<br>
<br>
I woke up a few seconds later on the ground. My friend was shaking me and was extremely worried. The only thing I could feel was a sharp pain as I had hit my head against the side of the building as I had fallen. I didn't remember falling over or blacking out what-so-ever and when I opened my eyes my brain scrambled to figure out why the hell I was lying on the ground. My friend helped me up and asked what was going on. He started tripping out a bit because he didn't understand what had just happened. I was still high, but my body felt really weird. It was weak and I didn't know why I had just blacked out. My friend carried me on his back to my house where I crawled into bed. I couldn't fall asleep and everything seemed like it was in slow motion. I couldn't tell how fast or slow time was moving and I couldn't feel my body at all. It wasn't scary or anything, just really strange.<br>
<br>
I woke up the next morning feeling completely fine, as usual after a night of smoking. I guess the reason I blacked out was my body's overall state. I guess I hadn't recovered well enough from the night before and smoking that joint had been a breaking point almost. For now I think I am going to slow down on my smoking and even try to quit for a couple months. My body has been in bad remission since the summer and I owe it a break from drugs in general.<!--   End Body   -->

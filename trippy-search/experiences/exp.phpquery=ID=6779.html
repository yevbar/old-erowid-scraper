You are about to read about my life altering experience.  I have done approximately 200 some odd hits of acid total. During this particular experience I was on 4 hits and was smoking Hash. On Good Friday of 1994 I had a few close friends over for the long weekend and my parents were away on vacation.<BR>
<BR>
I always mixed acid with hash because it intensifies my hallucinations and levels out any paranoia. I was 17 at the time. We were all very experienced with acid and I  had done it about 200 times approximately always with the same group of people, always at my house.  We would usually go outside for an adventure walk if we felt we needed to intensify our trips, but for the most part we spent alot of time on acid watching Fantasia, Yellow Submarine, and Pink Floyd the wall. We would always burn incense, have candles going, and we would always have hash to smoke in front of the glowing fireplace. It was like a ritual.<BR>
<BR>
For us acid was a very spiritual and scientific experience. We never did acid recreationally although it was fun. We used acid as a way of opening our minds up creatively and this left us impressionable. This night there were 3 of us. My friend Jon and my girlfriend Keely. <BR>
<BR>
This night started as any other would.  We ate our hits and sat down on the couch and smoked hash in front of the fireplace waiting for the sensation to come on.  I was always the first to notice it. As soon as the acid would hit my tongue I would get a wicked chill/twitch and about 20 minutes later I would be well on my way toward a peak.<BR>
<BR>
For me the peak always came on fast.  This night was no different.<BR>
I remember watching my ceiling drip and churn in waves.  This was like a reality meter. The more blasted we would get, the faster and crazier the ceiling would get. The ceiling is one of those drip ceilings with the spikey stucco coming off.  Often we would see faces or bodies inside the ceiling but this particular evening there was a skeleton clawing its way across.<BR>
<BR>
Then I started getting flashes. It was as though I was under a strobe light.  When I looked down at the candles and incense burner on the coffee table several of the candles were changing positions each time there was a flash. I could see trails of electricity moving between each of the candles as they flashed and changed position in a circular pattern. I looked across the carpet and it was growing and weaving as though it were alive. I remember the sensation of feeling as though the roof had been ripped off the house and as I looked up again at the ceiling there were many skeleton like creatures writhing there. I could see through the roof of the house and out into the night sky and I was watching the flourescent purple and green hued clouds spark out coils of electricity as they crossed the moon. My attention back on the table, the incense burner was puffing a heavy blue smoke which smelled more like sulfer than incense. As the smoke billowed off the end of the stick I could scry into it and see the faces of evil spirits and the shapes of small demons of various sizes and types twisting.<BR>
<BR>
As the smoke filled out and dissipated throughout the room it seemed to take over and each of the many demons would transform into another equally diabolical looking yet marvelously beautiful form. As this hallucination intensified I could hear my friends making strange groaning noises behind me but I paid no attention. They sounded as though they were whining and that they were afraid but I was lost in this vision. I realized I had been standing and that my arms were waving and that when I concentrated and breathed rythmically in and out I could control the entities within the incense smoke. With my eyes I would follow many of the small demons through their transformation process and I would see them conjoin<BR>
as the smoke disappated back toward the fireplace.<BR>
<BR>
The fireplace....  It had taken on a demonic face as well.<BR>
It was as though it were a dragon and the flames that licked inside its gaping mouth were the breath of a great wyrm.  I looked up and saw demons leaping about the ceiling and licking through the incense smoke. Faster and Faster, larger and larger the shapes began to grow and twist and change form. The demons would make their form known and then they would change state or disappear into a collective whole.<BR>
<BR>
These spirits looked much like the strange animals and creatures<BR>
depicted in occult books and dungeons and dragons monster manuals.<BR>
As intense as this was I was not afraid. Instead it was as much<BR>
a feeling of incredible power and evil and I could stand and it was exhilerating. It was then that Keely buried herself beneath a blanket and began screaming 'I can see the demons around you!' and I laughed. I was breathing them into the room and my friends were sharing this experience. With a tremendous intensity I summoned up a great figure who's outline I could make out. This figure was standing in a circle and there was a gateway behind it. I could see a three headed dog and other smaller demonic creatures behind the great figure but it was forcing those creatures back through the gateway as they tried to escape into the house.<BR>
The figure itself was immensely beautiful. It was so evil yet so compellingly elegant and beautiful. It was wingless but it had horns and I could make out the facial features of its eyes and nose  mouth and limbs although they were but an outline.<BR>
<BR>
Pulsing within this great demon were all of the other spirits that combined collectively as a part of him. Where we would have veins and bone and muscle tissue, the angel of darkness had spirits that gleefully flowed throughout his frame.  It was extremely intense. As he moved, the spirits that were making up his internals would constantly change form flicking from one shape to the next in an endless display of transformation.<BR>
There was no audible hallucination but I remember thinking 'who are you?' and psychically the spirit replied to me. 'Many.' 'Lucifuge Rofocal'.<BR>
<BR>
To be fair I had previously studied spirits so I may have invented that name from what I had already read, but for me I believe this. As the monstorous form turned to me I was compelled to one knee. At this point my friends were watching intently. moments later though Keely had to watch off and on because she was so frightened she was trying to shut the site out by closing her eyes. Jon was nowhere to be found. Apparently he had left. The demon turned to me and outstretched his hand and flexed with great might as a display of power. His face flew off toward me and through me and this continued for a split second but it felt like hours. Gradually his form diminished as the ember from the incense stick burned out and the smoke was sucked out up the chimney of the fireplace. One by one each of the spirits traveled their way from where the demon form was standing and flew up the chimney. This was the last time I ever did acid.<BR>
<BR>
It was incredible. It was intense. It has led me to the belief that acid is a gateway drug which can allow you to see into other planes of existance that run in parallel as our own, just at a different speed. I don't know whether this was a mass visualization (3 people saw it including myself) or just a very intense hallucination from a mega dose of LSD and hash but it doesn't matter to me. If my mind is capable of being that creative to be able to visualize something that intense (no artist could ever paint this.)  I doubt it. I believe it was real.  I believe and I will never see things the same way again.<!--   End Body   -->

10:00pm - smoked a hand-rolled joint of Wild Lettuce. The smoke was quite harsh. I'm a smoker, yet it was almost impossible to hold the WL smoke in for even more than a few seconds. It also burned down very quicky. One well-packed joint only yielded only 3-4 long drags.  I waited a few minutes and nothing. Not even a buzz.<BR>
<BR>
+0:15 - smoked a joint of California Poppy. CP was supposed to sedate me. I should say it didn't do much. The smoke, compared to WL, was much mellower, but still somewhat harsh, and smelled very similar to WL. It burned like a normal cigarette, which was neat. A few minutes after I finished, I felt my eyes became a little blurry. Just a little. And nothing else. I was becoming quite irritated by the lack of results.<BR>
<BR>
+0:20 - smoked 3 joints of Calea Zacatechichi, one after the other (was getting ready for bed anyway)<BR>
<BR>
The smoke proved very hard to hold in. It was harsh, though the taste was not unpleasant. I could hear popping sounds from burning buds. It was weird.<BR>
<BR>
+0:15 - burned my throat raw and ready for bed<BR>
<BR>
I got into bed and closed my eyes. I wasn't feeling anything at all from the  combination. I hoped I'd have a good dream. <BR>
<BR>
Well, I'd hoped in vain. <BR>
<BR>
8:30am - woke up and recalled some of my dreams<BR>
<BR>
I showered and while doing so, remembered most of what I'd dreamed. It had been a normal enough dream, no lucidity, no special insights. <BR>
<BR>
In conclusion, I'd say I get more buzz from smoking the first cigarette of the day. The  feel of the nicotine coursing through my veins and numbing my head a bit.<BR>
<BR>
I'd hate to say Calea doesn't work, but I'd have to say it anyway. Perhaps, next time, I would try an extraction of it instead. As for WL and CP, I'd probably make tea from them in the future.<!--   End Body   -->

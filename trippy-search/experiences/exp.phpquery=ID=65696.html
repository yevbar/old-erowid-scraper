Prior to my shrooming experience, the weeks leading up to the event were filled with research and fascination. I had wanted quite badly to trip because my only other shrooming experience was a complete joke, I ended up feeling a little strange and getting ripped off by seventy dollars. So I felt that a good trip was owed to me.  <br>
<br>
I must give you a little info about myself first. I am almost 20 years old, a sophomore in college and in the past year have developed this strong interest in psychoactive drugs, especially in mushrooms. I have smoked marijuana countless times, tried opium once, had a little run with coke and have done some wippets here and there.  <br>
<br>
It was summer. As a matter of fact, it was really late summer, only three days before my sophomore year started. My friend and I acquired the shrooms on a complete fluke. It was definitely unexpected, yet extremely surprising. The reason for this was because we have tried almost the whole summer to get some shrooms, but always ended up disappointed. From this point on, I will call my friend Trevor. <br>
<br>
We have just moved in our house and both had cut our losses on the previous attempts to get that most interesting fungus. It was Friday night. I had just gotten all my supplies for school and was wondering where in the hell the summer had gone. Keep in mind that at this point in my life I was very disappointed at myself for not obtaining any shrooms during the short summer. School was about to start and I knew nine months of book worming would soon be at my doorstep. <br>
<br>
It was about 9:30 p.m when I received a phone call from Trevor. My heart skipped a beat. He had found shrooms and was on his way to pick them up. After hanging up, I was consumed with a bittersweet symphony, bitter first, sweet later. Remember when I said that the weeks leading up to this event were filled with research? Well, I had promised myself that the next time I would do shrooms it would be while I was camping because after reading about a hundred reports, I had convinced myself that camping + shrooms = complete unison with nature. And that is exactly what I wanted. But on the other hand, we had found shrooms! I couldn’t believe it. I was about to embark on a journey that had no boundaries. A journey that would cause me to be shifted and lifted. A journey that did not care if I started it in a forest or in my house, because little did I know, I had a one way ticket to complete and utter craziness. <br>
<br>
10:00 p.m. Trevor and I weighed out the shrooms and prepared to eat them. Man did they taste like shit. You know that puppy chow some people make with powdered sugar and chex? Well, they looked a lot like that. I held my nose, chewed really fast and swallowed them with some Gatorade. The taste made me gag a lot but I knew they weren’t going to taste like strawberries. <br>
<br>
10:10 p.m. I’m feeling pretty strange. I was surprised at how fast the shrooms were kicking in. I had a rather large meal before hand and thought I had at least forty-five minutes to prepare myself, but I guess the shrooms were on speed or something. I was playing some Gears and I just couldn’t focus. My stomach was hurting and I had this very out of place feeling about myself. I step outside for some air.<br>
<br>
10:25 I sat on a step that put me in view of my whole backyard. It looked very beautiful and outlined. It was very dark outside but the moons light gave me an interesting picture. The next thing I remember is feeling extremely sick and shortly after, throwing up. I felt a lot better. I went inside to clean up, and then things started to get very strange.<br>
<br>
10:40 p.m. After leaving my bathroom, I went to the living room. I took a seat on the couch and could literally feel myself reaching a new plateau. I was hit by the psychedelic train. When I looked down at my shoe, I felt as though I was looking at it with kaleidoscope eyes. They were so many circles. They whole room was twisting and shouting. I wanted to see straight but that just wasn’t happening. I stood up, and the room just stopped. Throughout my trip, I noticed that when I stood up and walked around, I was a lot more in control of my functions. But sitting down was like entering a different world. <br>
<br>
11:00 p.m. I don’t know why, but I thought Trevor was lost. I knew he would find his way home though. I don’t know why I thought that but it kept me satisfied. I went out in my backyard again and this time it was like I stepped foot into a jungle. Trevor was actually out there but I didn’t seem to notice, nature was taking me over. Everything seemed so calm. The crickets were making this amazing sound. It was heaven to my ears. Then my attention went to the tree leaves. This was a cool part. The leaves looked as if they were falling from the trees, but in fact were not. They had this continuous fall to them and it looked so interesting. They just kept on falling, but moving no where. We went in.<br>
<br>
11:20 p.m. For some reason, Trevor and I just had to get out of the house. We decided to go on a bike ride. Pulling the bikes out of the garage, I ascended once more. Not only was my vision tripping me out, now I was losing my mind. I thought that if we went on this bike ride we would surely get lost. I was so scared, but it was the ride of my life. Flying down the street I could barely see anything. My vision was so distorted that everything was a circling blackish blob to me, until I saw a car. This was by far the most amazing part of my trip. When I watched a car go by, it was unlike anything I have ever dreamed before. They looked like razor sharp pieces of light just gliding down the street. It was actually very intimidating. I had to constantly promise myself that it was only a car.<br>
<br>
I couldn’t seem to focus on anything else but the cars. I remember thinking that if I looked too long at them, my eyes would start bleeding because they looked so sharp and pointy. I noticed Trevor was heading back towards the house so I followed. While crossing the street, the cars kept on freaking me out. A car would be about four hundred yards or so down the street, but I could hear them as if they were about to hit me. This caused me to almost shit my pants, but turned in to something that was amazing. After crossing the street I turned around and waited. I then closed my eyes and listened for a car. After hearing one and determining that it had to be pretty close, I opened my eyes and saw the car far down the street. I then watched this arrow of light float towards me in awe. It took about a minute for it to reach me but the sound never changed, even when it was right by me. It was very confusing to see a car very far away but hear it as if it were so close. I felt like I had super hearing abilities.<br>
<br>
11:50 p.m. We made it back to the house safe and sound. I asked Trevor if he saw what those cars looked like and he said no. I knew that I was on a level higher than his and was on my own. The house was a furnace when we got back in. We didn’t know if it was the shrooms or if the air conditioning was broken (turned out to be the AC). Bottom line, it was hot as hell, almost intolerable. Since we just moved in, we had no cable and now no cool air. We then went to our own universes’.                  <br>
<br>
12:00 a.m. As I was lying on the couch trying not to melt, I once again could feel myself rising to another level. This level was very cool, yet extremely emotional. My iPod docking station was playing some Guster and I was deeply involved with it. I could feel the sound waves rush out and hit me as every note was played. I had all these ideas that seemed so great and historic and I was going to write them down but when I got up to get a pen and paper, I had no idea what I was up for. This getting up and wondering what I’m doing happened numerous times during my trip so I just dealt with them as they came. I then knew what I wanted. I wanted to see a visualizer.<br>
<br>
After taking about ten minutes to turn on my 360, I finally hooked up my iPod and tuned on the visualizer with Pink Floyd playing. This was very insane. I was lost in circles and tubes. The first song that played was “Have a Cigar” and I really wanted a cigar. The lyrics in each song I heard had a huge impact on my mind. I was seriously engaged with my thoughts and emotions as they were put on a roller coaster full of loops and twists. I remember thinking about my cat I once had and how much I wished I wasn’t so young and he wasn’t so old when he died. It almost made me cry. Then I would think about my most remunerable moments when I played sports and those made me very happy. It was just an onslaught of feelings and emotions that kept hitting me violently. After what seemed to be hours, I got up and went to my room. <br>
<br>
12:45 a.m. I crashed on my bed and was put into a vast world of closed eye visuals. I saw cowboys and Indians fighting, cats and dogs were chasing each other, fire and rain trying to empower one another. I saw things that were opposites of each other fighting. This made me think a lot. I remember thinking that life was short and that we need to make the best out of it and just standing around and watching things happens is not enough, or at least for me it isn’t. I then saw stars, galaxies, nebulas and solar systems that made me think how huge the universe is and how happy I was to be taking an astronomy course. I saw so many visuals but can only remember a few. I began to come down.<br>
<br>
1:15 a.m. I came down hard and fast. This was, to my knowledge, one of the most enjoyable parts of the experience according to other people. For me, it was coming back down to Earth and gathering my thoughts I had before I ate those shrooms. Shortly after collecting myself, I felt very normal, but with a strange euphoric feeling. It was very satisfying. Trevor seemed to be on the same page and I took quite a liking to his explanation of his trip. I felt a closeness between him and I, and I believe our friendship was made a little stronger after that night. I knew though, that I had been on a voyage that took me far from this normal life and took me to a world that only I know exists. I look forward to exploring these strange new worlds in the near future and hope each one opens my eyes just as well as the world I had just left.<br>
<br>
I hope reading this experience report helped you in your efforts to understand these crazy mushrooms. If I could change anything about my trip, it would not be the setting, but myself. I was very tired before I ate the shrooms and that caused me to feel couched logged. I am glad I did shrooms.<!--   End Body   -->

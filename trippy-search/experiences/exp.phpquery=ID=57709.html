It was a particularly...auspicious night. My girlfriend and I of 2 and a half years notoriety had broken up perhaps 2 weeks before I inhaled my fathers medicine cabinet. A frequent and experienced drug user, i have (since this night) read both PiHKAL and TiHKAL, and explored the more intelligent side of drug abuse.<br>
<br>
I began the night reading The Way of the Shaman, and my mind, already twisted with grief, turned to the idea of the OSC, of altered states of consciousness.<br>
<br>
Having engaged in spiritual exploration via 5 MeO DMT, Shrooms, LSD, Salvia, etc ad nauseum, i was familiar with this state, and seemingly comfortable in my drug awareness, though I had not yet experienced my 4+.<br>
<br>
So, whilst my parents were away at a play (i was at this time living in the back guest house at my folks house), i stumbled into my parents bathroom. Staring at my haggard reflection, something slipped upstairs, and i flung open the cabinet door. My father, who is already chronically depressed and recently gotten over a severe car wreck, had a veritable cornucopia of pharmaceutical candies. <br>
<br>
I started on 4 Clonazepam and Diazepam, knowing one of the two (diazepam?)  to be a drug Snipers took in the field to steady their aim, so i figured it would do something. 45 minutes later i was still at baseline, and depression was setting in, so back up to the cabinet of dreams to see what else could be found...<br>
<br>
...4 pills each of Clonazepam and Ambien and two hours later i'm lying on my bed with Butcher blasting in my headphones 'writing' in my journal. Looking back at what I penned that night scares the living shit (can i say that?) out of me. A mirror image of the darkside of myself, something i never want to see again. I don't truly recall much else except chewing approx. 14 benadryl tabs in the midst of my angst filled night...<br>
<br>
Feels as though some part of me simply did not want to make it through that night.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, i'm not a suicidal person - I have studied martial arts for 16 years, read more books and attended more Ashraams and meditation centers I care to mention, yet all the same these drugs pulled this side from me, something perhaps hidden for too long.<br>
<br>
The following morning, still tripping, i called my father to ask him why time was subjective only to me...when he got home to take me to the hospital, I was talking to a woman in a red shirt (this is all I remember of her) next to my pool pump. My father, understandably distressed, took me to the ER, where it was discovered that I had an allergic reaction to Diphenhydramine, the active ingredient in Benadryll.<br>
<br>
A horribly life changing experience, I would hope this to serve as a warning: The world of drugs is a wonderful one, with worlds of potential not perceived by the masses, just be sure to read your warning labels.<!--   End Body   -->

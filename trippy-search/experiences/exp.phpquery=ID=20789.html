Last night was strange.<BR>
<BR>
I found what I thought to be datura plants growing wild on the hill I was on.<BR>
<BR>
I noticed that the plants were dried up and some of the seedpods had already cracked open. I ate a few just to see if they would kick in later. I put a bunch of other seeds in a container and brought them home for later testing.<BR>
<BR>
Then one night I decided to eat 1/2 to 2 teaspoons of seeds. I hadnt collected enough seeds for a second dose so I just chewed up a little at a time and chased it with water. The seeds were bitter but not even close to as bad as eating a canister of nutmeg with orange juice.<BR>
<BR>
Before dosing I read about the recomended dosages and the dangers involved just to make sure I wasnnt making the biggest mistake of my life. I knew what I was getting into and that I would probably get caught but I didnt care. So I finished off the seeds which came out to about three teaspoons and called some people cuz I was getting picked up just to cruise around.<BR>
<BR>
They came and got me and I told them what I had done and asked them not to throw me out of the car if I started buggin out. About three hours after taking the stuff it realy hit me. I dont remember much of the night but this is what people have told me and the little I do remember of the event.<BR>
<BR>
About four hours after I dosed up they dropped me off at my house. I had been talking to the seatbelt next to me asking it if it wanted to sit on my lap then buckling it in an attempt to invoke humor.<BR>
<BR>
I walked up to my house and fell on my ass right outside on the porch. When I got inside my mom interogated me like she always does and there was no denying that I was extremely messed up. I then attempted to make eggs and managed to dump the butter out of the container and put my socks in its place (I found out about this one the next day from my mom). I thought that I would go to my room and just sit out the rest of the trip like I always do. This is a somewhat difficult task when your self control is nonexistant. So I get out of bed and take a shower which woke everyone in the house up becouse of my singing and stumbling from time to time. I got out of the shower and started talking to somebody. I then recognized him as one of my friends which was strange becouse I felt like I had never met the person I was talking to. What amused me even more was that I then recognized the person I was talking to in the mirror to be me. Then I realized that the image in the mirror would copy my movements. At this realization I was in shock that the drug was effecting me this much. I left the bathroom and stumbled outside onto my snowcovered deck. The dog that lives there came inside but I didnt realize it. Its not even my dog. <BR>
<BR>
My house is small so I ran into practicaly every surface on the way to my room. My parents were very disturbed my lack of consideration. My dad had to wake up at three in the morning to get to work on time so he wasnt happy. He came into my room to talk to me and I said I would talk to him as soon as I was done talking to my brother. When I turned around he was gone and so was everyone else that was in my room. Daturas effect on me was interesting becouse it was very similar to other drugs I had taken all at once. The walls twitched and moved, I saw cockaroach antenas popping up from behind everything, saw flies and other flying insects everywhere, and I talked to many people that werent there. All of these effects I have felt as a result of taking dramamine. Also when it first kicked in in the begining I felt the heavy body feeling and the what I call I feel so full effect that I get from dxm.<BR>
<BR>
I thought I went to sleep but my mom told me that I was awake talking to myself all night. I only remember one incident when I woke up or thought I did and I was in the middle of saying something. My mom asked me if I was hungry and I told her that I had food in my room. She asked me where and I told her it was the pile of dirty clothes in my laundry container. I guess I went on like this all night. The entire experience basicaly consisted of me having delusions and halucinations to support them. I woke up at like four in the morning thinking that I had to go to school. My mom told me that it was Saturday and informed me of the time. She said that I was acting as if I acctualy thought that I was sober. I also felt like I had so much energy in my legs that if I didnt release it I was going to freak out. I would lay on my bed and kick my legs and thrash around wildly for long intervals of time. I had realy vivid and some lucid dreams during the night. When I woke up in the morning I didnt even think much of it. I took a shower and when I saw spider webs and spiders crawing through them in the corners of the shower. I remembered that I was still trashed from the night before but also wondered whether the spiders were real or not. I decided that they were hallucinations but couldnt help having a fit when one jumped on me. I was starting to catch on that the people I was talking to werent real becouse they would always disappear. They kept tricking me though and I always caught myself talking to hallucinations. I got to a point when I would just look away then look back and they would be gone when they tried to talk to me. Even when real people tried to talk to me I would try to make them dissapear.<BR>
<BR>
I still feel a little screwy two days later. I see the occasional twitch in the wall or see some flies in the room that I just know arent real.<BR>
<BR>
To sum up the experience its not something I plan on repeating any time soon. If the setting had been right like an afternoon out in the country away from everyone then the experience would much more enjoyable. A drug is only as good as the setting so choose it wisely. Another thing is that I could not discern what was real and what wasnt. Someone could have easily been mistaken for something that I felt threatened by and I could have realy hurt someone. I put myself and others in danger by using this plant so recklessly. Im lucky though it could have ended up much worse. <BR>
<BR>
Be carefull<BR>

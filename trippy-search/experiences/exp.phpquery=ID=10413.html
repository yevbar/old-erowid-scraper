Dosage<BR>
Liberty Caps (dried) - 1.4 grammes - oral.<BR>
Unknown species of mushroom (dried) - 1.7 grammes - oral.<BR>
Hashish - ~3 grammes - Smoked in water pipe.<BR>
Salvia Divinorum 5X extract - 1/4 gramme - Smoked in water pipe.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Set and Mindset:<BR>
Both participants were elated having just moved into a new apartment. Most rooms had little furniture and all breakables and electrical equipment had been moved to the corners for safety. (We knew that Salvia can cause people to stand up and wander around so sought to prevent anyone falling face-first into a television set). We decided to take the mushrooms together but again for safety decided to take turns with the Salvia to prevent mishaps. Always better to be safe than sorry.<BR>
<BR>
This has been a strange day.<BR>
At around 12:00 My friend Tane and I chewed and swallowed 1.4 grammes of Liberty Caps each which we had bought along with a 1/2 gramme vial of 5x Salvia Divinorum extract from a local smart shop. We waited for what we think was an hour but felt no effects beyond a mild giggly euphoria. Tane took a large hit of hash from the bong and that seemed to trigger the mushrooms for him. Tane slipped into the trip and seemed to be enjoying himself immensely. <BR>
<BR>
For me, the trip was about to get a lot more peculiar.<BR>
The world began to seem brighter and colours became much more pronounced, as if someone had turned the contrast on my eyes to maximum. Apart from this common effect, I experienced no other visuals and so decided to consume the other mushrooms. Three days ago I took 15 grammes of Cubensis mushrooms which had produced extreme euphoria and strong visuals and yesterday I took another 15 grammes along with 3 grammes of Morning Glory seeds which produced a soporific and introspective trip with only very mild visual effects. I deduced from this that my lack of visual effects was due to a tolerance to the mushroom. <BR>
<BR>
After another half an hour I felt soporific and was unaware just how much my perception of reality had been altered. I wandered through to the living room and accepted all the strange colours as being perfectly normal. I eventually completely forgot I had taken any substances as I slipped deeper and deeper into a dream-like state all the time accepting that all of it was completely normal.<BR>
<BR>
Then I had a revelation...<BR>
<BR>
I suddenly realised that this reality was not the one I usually inhabited and I had no idea how the hell I had got here. I was experiencing no other visuals apart from vibrant colours but my mind was definately working in mysterious ways. I looked at everyday objects and although they looked normal they were somehow different and alien. This feeling that everything was different was extremely intense and I truly believed I had somehow changed to a different reality. I sat for what seemed like hours just marvelling at this new place and what I had done. At one point the thought crossed my mind that I could not trust my senses to tell me where my physical body really was; Was I lying in bed dreaming all of this? Or even worse was I lying in the middle of a  road somewhere? I no longer trusted anything I saw, heard or felt. I tried to explain all of this to Tane but eventually decided he probably wasn't there anyway and I was wasting my (imaginary?) breath. Gradually the effects subsided and I returned to a relatively normal state.<BR>
<BR>
For the next few hours I smoked marijuana and tried to make sense of what had happened. I thought that nothing could match this experience for sheer unsettling weirdness but there was much, much more to come.<BR>
<BR>
I emptied out the vial of Salvia and divided the crushed extract into two 1/4 gramme doses with the aid of a set of scales. I emptied the material into the water pipe and Tane took a lungfull, held it and laid back. After several minutes he said he felt nothing at all so I gingerly poured my dose into the bong expecting nothing but a sore throat from the smoke. How absolutely mind-buggeringly wrong that assumption was still makes me giggle at the naivete of it. I took a large and hard drag of the pipe and held the smoke for approximately 30 seconds then exhaled. I laid down on the ground but felt nothing so after perhaps another 30 seconds I sat up and finished the bong and again laid down. Suddenly I was again not in my normal reality, but if the mushrooms were intense then this was EXTREME. <BR>
<BR>
First my vision altered so that everything became geometric shapes of flat colour. A plate I was looking at became a perfect blue circle against the pale blue floor and all sense of perspective became meaningless. It was as if someone had taken a photograph, slapped bright paint over everything to remove all shading, lighting and perspective then glued it directly to my eyeballs.  I was completely unable to comprehend what I was seeing and I think I let out a low moan and gasped 'Oh fuck'. Only a few seconds had passed since lying down for the second time but already things had changed far beyond my ability to comprehend them. The world disappeared and became pure flat whiteness and a giant wheel appeared before me. The wheel was orientated so that it's edge was facing me and it rotated vertically. Along the edge were large boxes. Some were filled with things which I can now no longer remember and others were empty. I knew that at one time I had a physical form but wherever it was it certainly wasn't here. I remembered that Tane was somewhere near me and I attempted to raise a 'hand' in the hope he would see me and realise I had lost the plot. <BR>
<BR>
One of the boxes now contained my hand and I saw it in its box go round and around the wheel along with all the other stuff. By now I was in a panic but quite unable to do anything about it. I shouted out for help and then saw that my voice was now in one of the boxes (I have no idea how to explain how I could see my voice but I could). I heard my shout for help repeated as it went round and around the wheel in its box. I was deathly afraid that if I tried to move or speak in this place then each part would end up in these boxes and I would be left in oblivion so I stopped trying to speak or move. The volume of the shout would increase and decrease as it got further and closer on its journey around the wheel and every time it was at its furthest away point I hoped and wished with all my soul that it was close enough to Tane for him to hear it and that he could somehow rescue me from wherever the hell I was. I was sure that everything that was me was being disassembled and if I didn't do something about this very quickly I would spend eternity trapped in all these boxes spinning endlessly. <BR>
<BR>
Very suddenly the vision stopped and I sat up however I was still far from normality. I was still experiencing the flat, bright colours, geometrical alteration of shapes and complete lack of depth-cues and perspective. I searched desperately amongst these meaningless shapes for something that could concievably be Tane. I saw some of the shapes move and assumed that was him. I held out my arms to either side of the slowly moving pink shape I assumed was his face as if making a boundary to keep the face shape in my attention. I was worried that if I looked away for even a split second I would never find it again and would be lost in this realm of insanity forever. I said something along the lines of  'If that's you then for God's sake do NOT fucking move.' I asked him if the two flat blocks of colour at either side of my vision were my arms and the strange pink shape above the black and white rectangles was his face. He replied that I was correct and asked me what happened. I could only stare at him as my vision slowly returned to a more comprehensible state. I moved to the other side of the room and sat next to a radiator to smoke a cigarette and try and get warm.<BR>
<BR>
It was now about 3 - 5 minutes since I had smoked the Salvia and I thought I had returned to normality. As I sat and smoked, an extremely strong feeling of pulling, melting and twisting overcame my body. I laid back with a groan and felt myself melt and become part of the radiator and floor. This feeling lasted for about a minute and with it returned the transformation of everything into 2 dimensions except this time the shapes bled into each other. I was not panicky this time and I knew the sensation, however extreme, was chemically induced and would pass swiftly. Pass it did and I was soon back to the real world albeit drowsy and very confused. <BR>
<BR>
My eyes and mind had been opened wider than I had ever thought possible but it was too much, too fast. It was as if I had taken the mushrooms and salvia for granted and tried to use them as toys, but they had taken me by the scruff of the neck in turn and shown me that all the concepts of reality I take for granted are flimsy things and should they wish it they could toy with me and fracture my mind on a whim. I have a new-found respect for the Sacred Mushrooms and Divine Mint and have been made shockingly aware that the thin tissue of reality is just a matter of perception and that perception is a very, very, subjective thing.<!--   End Body   -->

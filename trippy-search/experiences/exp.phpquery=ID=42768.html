Well it's been a while since I have had a good amount of mushrooms so I thought I would get some with some money I recently earned.  My friend had some chocolates that had probably 3 grams a piece for 20$.  I got one hoping I would do it that night but I ended up waiting til the next day.  After a day of smoking dank and doing yardwork with mom I decided I would eat mine around sunset.  <BR>
<BR>
A couple of hours before I was going to take mine mom said 'if you could get another I would eat one with you'.  I jumped at the idea.  We have only tripped together 3 times but it has always been fun.  We ended up eating them at about 8:30 and started feeling the effects at about the 20 min. mark, which is fast for me as it usually takes me a little longer to get into my trips (possibly because of body weight).  After we ate them mom went to take a shower and I thought I would go drum for a minute.  Before I got set up to drum I was already getting that familiar feeling in my head and all my motions, walking, drumming, dancing all seemed to just flow.  I always feel this release of physical tensions that I really didn't know I had.  I drummed to some Hendrix and a Perfect Circle and nailed every part.  <BR>
<BR>
After playing several songs I thought I would check to see if mom was out of the shower and if she was feeling as good as I was.  She said she was just now starting to feel it at about the 45 min. mark.  We just sat in the den and began to listen to some Tiesto until the Daily Show on comedy central came on at 10.  So at 10 we are an hour and a half into it and the visuals I was getting were VERY acid like, very smooth.  Most of the time mushrooms make my visual perception 'choppy' like there is a strobe light going or they just make everything sparkle and look magical.  This particualar strain however made colors change and crawl around.  While watching The Daily Show all the stuff in the background I never paid attention to before was crawling and flashing.  I was seeing faces and eyes in the background and in shadows and out of the corners of my eyes.  It was around this time that mom sneezed and exclaimed 'wow that was the weirdest sneeze!'  Seconds after sneezing she got up to run across the room to throw up.  She said she hadn't felt like throwing up at all but it hit her right after she sneezed.  I thought it was odd that it didn't happen until over an hour and a half into it.  She said she wasn't having a bad trip or caught up in any funky thought loops, it just came out of nowhere.  <BR>
<BR>
After the vomiting and watching The Daily Show, we decided to go outside and chill in a swing in the backyard.  She commented on the way to the swing that she wasn't tripping like she was the last time she did mushrooms but she definitely was tripping.  We sat in the swing for what felt like 10-20 min and then came back in because it was a little chilly.  After getting back inside I decided to pack a small bowl to ease my uneasy stomach.  While preparing that mom went to throw up again.  This time not nearly as much but still vomit none the less.  After throwing up she decided to hit the pipe once or twice to try and ease her nausea.  After another hour or so of talking and listening to shpongle mom decided that she just wanted to lie down in her bed because she was pretty tired and pretty cold.  So I packed another bowl and we went upstairs to her room.  After we started talking the subject of her boyfriend that passed away about a year ago came up, as I figured it would.  She just wants to move on but everything she does reminds her of him.  We talked about that for a bit and feel like it really helped.  I had hoped that the experience would loosen her up enough to talk about it from a different perspective, and it did.  <BR>
<BR>
After we smoked the bowl we just sat and shared what we were seeing in her ceiling.  This was probably my favorite part of the whole experience.  Her ceiling has random splotches of paint that were crawling and breathing while the ceiling rippled like I was under water and the ceiling was the surface!  After an hour or two she finally crashed and I came downstairs to listen to some music and start to write up this report.  I just had to share this amazing night.  I feel like the luckiest person in the world because of my close relationship with my mom that has only gotten closer after these recent trips.<!--   End Body   -->

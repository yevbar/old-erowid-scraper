Since there isn't much information out there about DXM and Wellbutrin, I had no choice but to test it out myself. So one evening I took 150mg of DXM (10 x 15mg gelcaps), puncturing the capsules before I downed them. About 30-45 minutes after this I thought I felt noticably less inhibited, slowed, with a bit of ataxia, almost like being drunk but clearer in a way. My over-affectionate cat trotted into the room and began to throw herself at me. I found this significantly less annoying than usual. I felt very relaxed but that was the extent of it. Two hours later the experience hadn't changed and seeing as it was late and there was nothing to do I went to sleep.<br>
<br>
About an hour after falling asleep I woke up feeling very uneasy. There was a feeling of dread, but it wasn't a panic attack. I noticed that I was extremely dizzy at this point, although moving still felt good. A warm feeling pulsed in my body periodically, concentrated mostly in the back of my head and somewhat in the bottom of my legs. This was not a pleasant feeling at all, my head almost felt like it was on fire. I was sweating a lot also, and shaking. This really worried me, but I tried to lay back and calm myself down, thinking that this was a low dose and it would be over in a few hours. This helped some, along with having some water, and I was able to get a VERY broken sleep, with symptoms gradually declining. I woke up about seven hours after taking the DXM, still dizzy, with dialated pupils and a headache. I don't think I'll be taking any more DXM, at least not while taking bupropion.<!--   End Body   -->

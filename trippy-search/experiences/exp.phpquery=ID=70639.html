Okay here is my account of my experience with Ayahuasca.  I got all my instructions online.<br>
<br>
I chose the Ayahusaca analog choice 3 from the webpage.  Mostly because it seemed like the most intense of all journeys & I wanted it to be very intense.  Let me just tell you I got what I asked for and then some.<br>
<br>
I started out preparing the DMT at my girlfriend Lorraine's house.  I cooked the DMT for about 2 hours.  I combine it with some ascorbic acid.  I also divided the Syrian Rue into capsules.  I had a bunch of the capsules much more than I would need for one dose.  I ended up taking six capsules which was WAY too much esp. considering the Syrian Rue was x10 strength.   I had 1/2 ounce of DMT [Diplopterys cabrerana (chaliponga)]& 1 ounce of the MAO inhibitor (Syrian Rue).  <br>
<br>
Like they suggest doing I fasted for 24 hours.  When I took the Syrian Rue I had basically nothing in my stomach.  I did drink a little hot chocolate which I ended up throwing up later.  They were not kidding when they say you're probably going to throw-up.  I don't think I have ever thrown up as much as I did on AYA.  Around 6 PM I took six Syrian Rue pills.  Then I went to this graveyard called the Evergreen Cemetery.  I waited until ten past 7 before I took the MAO.  I was already beginning to feel light headed from the Syrian Rue alone.  I thought I better drink this stuff fast.  So I did.  I drank it & about 10 min later I began throwing up.  The puking & dry heaving lasted the entire trip.  <br>
<br>
I had a lot of visuals.  I felt very ill so the less I moved the better it was.  I had a real body high too.  I felt very drunk.  It was like being very ill on drinking way too much.  I know I over did it on everything.  For some reason I didn't believe the directions & thought I knew better by taking way too much into my body.  My stomach certainly didn't like it.  I was lying on the black earth puking my guts out with visuals EVERYWHERE.  It was like some of the visions I had on mushrooms or acid but much more intense.  All the trees & leaves kept changing into Faeries.  I saw a mother plant instructing her close by baby.  Like a mother playing with her child.  I was getting cold laying there on the ground but through shaking & imagining fire rushing through my body I was able to keep myself somewhat warm.  I kept thinking about the Tibetans & how they can learn to even melt snow & stay warm.  It was difficult.  I kept thinking about moving to my warm van but somehow I could not get up off the ground or will myself to walk.  Just imagine being totally wasted on a bottle of Vodka or something & not being able to walk & having the spins really bad.  That is what it was like.  I know I over did it with how much I took into my body.  I did about 5 times the amount I should have.<br>
<br>
The visuals were great though & the only thing that would make me wants to do it again.  If you have seen the Green Man then you might know about what I was seeing in the leaves.  They all kept changing into faces.  Also branches became arms.  I felt like I was seeing nature the way it was for the plants.  I felt very connected with the earth energy.  I felt as if I was being watched by the trees & plants around me & they were all smiling at me.  After lying on the dirt for what seemed like hours I finally managed to get up.  I was very shaky on my feet & it took all my effort not to fall down.  I walked very slowly back to my van.  It felt like it took an eternity to get there.  On the way I had some AMAZING visuals.  Solid things had sparks of energy coming out of them.  Especially cars..  Cars had these sparks is the best way I can describe it coming out of them.  I walked also around a spiral staircase & there was energy coming out of the circle.<br>
<br>
When I finally made it back to my van I couldn't even imagine doing something like zipping up the sleeping bag I just lay under & covered up the best I could.  I was shivering but somehow this seemed like part of the trip.  I was meant to be cold.  Everything really seemed like it was meant to be the way it was.  I spent the rest of the night thinking about my life.  It was pretty dark stuff I was looking at.  I was thinking about my girlfriend from High School a lot & about my mother.  It is hard to talk about all my realizations, they just kind of got stuck in my head.  I ended up staying awake all night & not feeling any tiredness.  I went to lunch the next day where I normally go for free meals.  I was very annoyed by everyone around me & everything was much amplified.  It was like being totally hung-over & drained completely.  I couldn't eat that much without feeling sick.  I ended up going back to my van to rest.  I took some of my psyche meds & fell asleep.  Lorraine ended up showing up at my van when it got dark out.  I guess she wanted to see how I was doing.  I ended up going back to her house & passing out again.  I was so drained.<br>
<br>
All & all it was interesting but very hard to deal with at times.  The body high & the visuals were amazing but all the puking was very distressing.  I would maybe do it again sometime if I took much less of the ingredients.  I think I just over did it.  If you try AYA I would suggest you read all the info first & actually follow their advice unlike I did.<!--   End Body   -->

After researching alot on the effects achieved when on LSD I finally came up with the balls to try it, as I was always worried about becoming a headcase. Myself and 3 of my closest mates decided to try it at the schoolies festival. Which is the giant week long party that occurs every year in every state as year 12’s complete their final exams. My self and my best friends had rented a house for the week and planned to drink ourselves into submission as well as do MDMA and meth (that we had used throughout out our high school lives). But wanting to do a hallosigenic we reserved a day and night to forfill our curiosity. I had bought the blotters from a dealer from school who told me to be careful as they were pretty potent. We stored them in an air tight jar in the kitchen and decided to take them on the 4th day of the festival. <br>
<br>
The day soon arrived and we woke up amped for the experience to begin. We all took a tab each at about 4pm just after lunch. J and myself decided to sit outside and smoke a few cones before the acid kicked in. After the first hit from the bong I called it quits and went back in side. It had only been about 30 minutes since we dropped the LSD, I began to feel a little strange. I began to see trails from my mates walking round the room. I told them that I was beginning to feel it, they were asking me what it was like as it had not kick in for them yet. We all sat down on the porch and waited for the effects to really begin. About 5 minutes after I first started seeing trails from people I noticed the trails for everything as I turned my head. The way I can describe it is that it was like a photo being taken with a camera with a slow shutter speed, as you move the camera the light blurrs and you get a photo that looks kinda like what I was seeing.<br>
<br>
About 1 hour after we dropped the acid I wanted to go for a walk. J was up for it but the other two just wanted to sit there. So me and J left not knowing where we were going, we just decided to keep walking. We were walking for what seemed like 15 minutes when an old friend from primary school recognized me. She ran up and gave me a big hug and started talking about something. I remember looking into her sunglasses and seeing my self in the lenses and think that this is what she is looking at. She kinda realized that I wasn’t listening to a word that she was saying and my mind was drifting she asked me what I was on.<br>
<br>
This question confused me as I was stuck with the image of in primary school. I said something like you’re too young to be talking bout drugs. She laughed and put her number in my phone and asked me to call her tomorrow. We departed and J and I continued on our journey to the unknown destination. We kept walking and we were starting to peek. We passed a large gum tree that was growing through the pavement. J and I sat down and stared at this for what only seemed like a minute. I remember looking at the trunk that had cracked the pavement and thinking that the tree was trying to grow but the pavement was holding it back. I was saying to myself be free, be free.<br>
<br>
Until I looked over at J who was lying on his stomach looking at a trail of ants walk along the path. I joined him and asked him what he was doing, before I could finish what I was saying though he cut me off saying shhhh, you’ll scare them away. I have no idea how long we were there for but when we got up we noticed it was really dark and apart from the sound of distant music it was pretty quiet as well.<br>
<br>
We walked and walked through the dark streets not caring where we were or where we were going. We came to an oval where we lay down about 4 hours after dropping. I remember wanting to be surrounded in nature. I was rolling around on the grass, the feeling of the grass was strange and I suddenly felt like I was crushing the grass and holding it back from living like the concrete was to the tree, so I tried to think my weight away so I would no longer be crushing the grass.<br>
<br>
I was suddenly floating off the ground. It was the most amazing experience of my life I was actually floating. I do not know how long I was in this levitating state for but I only came out of it when a group of kids our age came walking across the oval. I heard a whooshing sound that sounded like they were doing nitrous. I call out to them and they came over. It was amazing I had never met these 3 guys before but we got along so well they were just on their way to a party and asked us if we wanted to come.<br>
<br>
They kept talking about something I kinda drifted away which was when I spotted the penguin in their hand (my name for a whipped cream dispenser). They must have seen me looking at it cause they soon asked me if I wanted to hit it. This question puzzled me as I thought did I want to hit it, but they started preparing it for me anyway. I sucked in the sweet air and it reminded me of year 10 when I first tried it. I could feel it build up in me and as I exhaled it, time and matter really started to distort. I fell onto my back and my mind was taken away. I felt no body I was only a pair of eyes being propelled up into the sky. I was speeding along at unimaginable speeds and traveled past stars galaxies and colourful clouds.<br>
<br>
I don’t now how long I was out of it for but as I returned it was like someone had hit the rewind button and everything ran backwards until I was back lying on my back. I opened my eyes to these strange people looking over me. One said “where do you think he is right now” that was when I sat up and could not say a word. I looked back up at the sky and say the band of stars that made up the rim of the Milky Way. The stars looked so ‘alive’ they just seemed so bright and as I looked at them I became aware of the fact that I was looking out of our world and into another. I was looking into the infinity, looking into space. This blew my mind and every time I look at the stars now I still think of that experience. <br>
<br>
The guys must have left because when I came back to the acid reality I was alone. J had left me as well, but I felt good about being alone as I believed that the reason the acid was fading was because all of the living things around me were drawing it out of me, in order to balance knowledge out again. The acid state of mind is an unnatural state to be in so to restore me to normal my surroundings will suck the experience out of me. I came to the conclusion that the bigger the living thing the more of the experience it can take from me and as I was only surrounded by small blades of grass and no people so it will take a while to return me to normal. This I a pretty fuck up view of an acid trip but at the time it seemed plausible.<br>
<br>
I started walking until I came to a lake, on the banks of the lake I found a wooden boat and thought it would be a good idea to spend the rest of the trip in the middle of the lake looking up at the stars. So I jumped in the boat and drifted around. Not long after I got in the boat it began to get really windy and it soon started to rain. The boat was being blown around and I thought I was going to die, I was playing my life through my mind and I heard the song thirty three by the smashing pumpkins. The next thing I knew I was in the water and sinking. I was in a peaceful state and wasn’t scared of dieing; I accepted my fate and believed I was going to a better place. I truly believed that I was going to discover the meaning of it all. THEN I WAS DEAD. I traveled through space with images of random times in my life being played like a slideshow. And then black. <br>
<br>
The next thing I remember is hearing birds; I was in a dreamy state and believed that I was in a new life. I sat up only to see that I was in a sand pit in a park somewhere. It was one of the strangest moments of my life I was convinced that I had died that night. I looked around to see the lake but saw nothing but grass, trees and a play ground in the park. Dazed and confused I made my way to the road where kids were walking around everyone giving me a strange look as they passed me. I looked at my singlet and saw that it was covered in vomit. I had not noticed it before and I took it off and through it on the ground. Luckily it was schoolies and there were people walking around in board shorts and bikinis so I didn't stand out. I was walking down the road back to our house replaying the events of the night back through my head. I couldn’t come to terms with the fact that I had died. I couldn’t wait to tell my friends about the experience I had. <br>
<br>
I made my way back to the house, and as soon as I walked through the door I knew something was wrong. I walked into the bathroom and saw the mirror was smashed and there was blood on the floor. I walked through the house and realized that it had been trashed. There was glass everywhere, and there was blood on the walls of the bathroom. I called P who was on of my friends who stayed at home, he picked up the phone and told me that he was at the hospital, that D had flipped out last night and went through the house smashing all the windows in the house as he saw evil in his reflection. I grabbed a shirt, jumped on my bike and rode to the hospital to see P and D sitting in the lobby talking to a doctor. I asked what happened and the doctor said that D had a bad trip. I looked at D and he was pale and shaking, he had a bandage around his hand where he smashed the mirror. P said that our parents were on their way coming to pick us up. <br>
<br>
This all happened 2 months ago and D is almost back to normal. I haven’t been allowed to see P yet cause his parents have kept him home, but I have spoken to him on the phone a couple of times, he won't talk about his trip, I guess it was really bad. I’ve only told my girlfriend about what happened to me that night how I died in a lake. She made me promise that I wouldn’t do LSD again, but I don’t think I would anyway because of what happened to D.<!--   End Body   -->

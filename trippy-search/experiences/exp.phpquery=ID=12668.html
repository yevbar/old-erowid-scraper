The night had started off rather blasé, myself waking up at 6pm and my companions not waking up till 5:30. We decided it was too late to drive to Tampa for the weekend, so we all decided to stay in the dorm and get some work done. Later on that evening, my friend who we will call Adam (a very experienced user of many wonderful hallucinogenic substances) called me to enquire about the chances he might sample some of the fascinating material I had acquired. My voicemail, 'I was just thinking, would you be willing to watch me dance with the fox tonight?' As befits my generous nature, I told him that it would be my pleasure to help him have a successful and positive trip for his first time. (Most of my practical experience with that substance acquired the night previous, when we all decided to take between 10-17mg of 5-meo-Dipt). <BR>
<BR>
I find 5-meo-Dipt to be wonderfully subtle and gentle, with the potential to make some really good things happen. It is a very intellectual drug, letting one examine an idea or a question or a thought about life from a thousand lenses of various magnification at the same time. I find Foxy is less for introspection then for confirmation. The ideas one has a thousand times a day can be examined out of the context of ones everyday mindset. The things I was vague with an opinion about can be made crystal and profound in the light of the fox. Quite nice. So we're chilling in the dorm room at about 8:30, some friends wanted to come in and play some videogames. They proceed to do so, and Adam arrives at about 8:30. After some sitting on the bed and floor watching our friends playing games, I decided it was time for Adam to dance. We retired to the dorm bathroom  where I prepared Adam a moderate (8-10mg) dose of this interesting tryptamine. Some very unpleasant faces were made when holding the prepared solution of Dipt and water, I told him it would taste bad and he said it was something he was prepared to deal with. <BR>
<BR>
More sitting on the bed when another friend of mine who we will call Clint showed up. He and I had purchased some MDMA tablets the night before, as it had been more then two months since we last rolled, we both decided it was time to do so again. We stayed in the room for a half hour or so when my cell phone rang. It was the one we will call Keith, he had just rolled up his masterful blunt and was waiting for Adam, Clint and Myself to extract ourselves from the now crowded room to spend some quality time in his car. Adam was enjoying himself very much after smoking a good amount of cannabis, experiencing what I myself experienced just the night before. After a half hour or so of smoking, Clint and I decided to eat the MDMA after we returned from the local fast food place. When we got back, Adam was feeling tired and decided to go home and to sleep. His story of a good time with foxy ends there but mine goes on. <BR>
<BR>
We got back at about midnight and decided to eat the small pink tablets stamped with a picture of Aladdin’s lamp. I had just had a big meal so I wasn’t expecting something to happen for at least another hour or so Keith and I and some other friends decided it was time to visit the car again. We left Clint to his own devises being looked after by one of our “relatively” substance-free friends (he was just a little drunk). Down in the car, the cannabis seemed to jump start the MDMA a little. We were sitting in the car listening to music, and it started to do that nice thing it does when it becomes your whole world and you live only as an aspect of it being swallowed by the sound - fun! That lasted for another half hour or so, and it was then that we started wondering what Clint was up to. <BR>
<BR>
Clint wanted to go for a walk. Since it was late and since no one else was on a hallucinogenic amphetamine at the time, I felt it was my duty to go with him. We take the standard walk around campus, ending up at the tree-with-a-wall-in-it. At the same time rowdy drunkards came to the fountain behind us and threw several girls in. It was very funny, but the MDMA was coming on faster so we had to walk. We walked to the music building, and to my vast surprise, my name has finally been added to the list, which meant I was free to use the practice rooms whenever I chose to. We got into the room where my favorite piano is and I sit down and start to play for me own enjoyment as well as that of my companion. I definitely play the piano best when no substances have been ingested, but playing while on MDMA gave the keys beneath my fingers a whole other dimension, I suppose I was able to feel the music as I played, although it was not as specific as that, just a vague feeling of being connected to the keyboard.<BR>
<BR>
I had finished playing when Keith called me reminding me it was time for another visit to his car. Clint and I came back to my room and as Keith was still busy with preparations for the impending trip to his car, so we went into my neighbor’s room. When we went in I was feeling in a really happy mood, I even ran over and hugged my startled neighbor sitting at her computer waiting for a movie to start. It was soon decided that attention could no longer be paid to this film. Good timing, as Keith opens the door and lets us know its time. <BR>
<BR>
At this point, the MDMA is strong, but not very strong, so I decided we should take a small amount of 5-meo-Dipt, having read some interesting things about this combination. I thought it would allow me to examine all the openness and clarity of the roll, and indeed it did, to some extent. We got to the car and start listening to music while blazing, good fun. Now the way that the foxy worked on the MDMA was very interesting, the best example would be a simple thought I had during the experience. The emotional part of my mind which was totally in the arms of the MDMA said “I wish this would last forever”. Which was quickly answered by the rational side of my mind, “No you don’t, if it did, you would no longer have fun, this would become normal, you don’t ever want this to be come normal, do you?” The fox snapped me out of total revelry and allowed me to observe the situation with the filters of my intelligent and analytical mind no longer in outer space, the foxy kept me in orbit, but still in touch with the ground. <BR>
<BR>
Once we get out of the car and everyone is where they want to be, we went back up to my room to relax or play videogames or wait to see if something interesting still happens. Hilarity ensues. I end up in my room with my roommate out cold and me up writing this report at about 7:30, waaaay after the sun has come up. I felt no stomach discomfort on 5-meo-Dipt as affects some people, and felt it did add a subtly analytical flavor to the open caress of energy that flown through the body while on MDMA. I find this to be a good combination, but only recommend it to someone who has at least some experience, as it could quite possibly become very intense very fast. Nothing overwhelming though, provided one does not end up taking too much Dipt. But if you can be safe with the r-chems then I assume you can handle this nice little combo. Save this one for when you deem the time is right, it is not something to do every weekend. <BR>

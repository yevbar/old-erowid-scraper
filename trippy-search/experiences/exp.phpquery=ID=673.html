In my early teens I was very interested in the cause and effect of hallucinations, both drug and non-drug induced. Reading reports of hostages and terrorists suffering hallucinations due to lack of sleep led me to my own experiments with sleep deprivation. I shall skip my first experiments and detail the final experiment which had the most profound effects.<BR>
<BR>
When I was about 18 I talked some friends of various ages (19-35) into participating in a sleep deprivation experiment with me. Most lasted less than 36 hours. I was determined to last longer than my previous 3 days and with the help of 'wake-ups,' I managed to last 9 days.<BR>
<BR>
After two days exhaustion began to set in, my thoughts became scattered, and I was visibly fatigued. Dizzyness came and went. Though I felt miserable, I was determined to continue. <BR>
<BR>
Caffeine pills followed on day 3, giving great boosts of energy that would last about an hour or so, but were followed by an even more intense exhaustion. On day 5 I gave up the pills as I decided they were making it harder to cope. Thoughts had now become highly confused and though I was awake and for all intents and purposes alert, I had difficulty reacting to stimuli and holding a decent conversation, giving half answers or just not making much sense. As well, my body was heavy and I staggered as I walked. By this time my body had begun to be effected. My face was pale and my skin was becoming very itchy and problematic, my stomach hurt, my appetite was non-existent.<BR>
<BR>
By day 6, exhaustion was interspersed with natural bouts of lucidity that would last up to 4 hours, during which I was wide awake, clear headed, vocal, nimble, and could not have slept if I had wanted to, though I ached. Just as suddenly fatigue would set in during which I experienced audio hallucinations and some minor visual distortions similar to hypnogogic hallucinations. Emotionally, though I tried to stay affable around my friends, I was moody and disagreeable. In the following days my hallucinations became more severe, culminating in a full-blown vision of a large goggle-eyed cheshire cat laughing at me from atop a kitchen cupboard. After this incident I laid down on my bed and became overwhelmed by sound and vision. Next thing I knew I awoke 2 days later. Since this experiment I have found it impossible to remain awake for more than 20 hours. I can only assume that I set off some kind of saftey mechanism in my brain, some kind of trigger of sleep.<!--   End Body   -->

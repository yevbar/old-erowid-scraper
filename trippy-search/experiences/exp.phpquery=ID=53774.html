Background:<BR>
I am a 22 year-old male working in India at a technical support call center.  I am originally from the USA and am working for an American company out here.  Recently on a trip back to the US to see my family, I ordered 100mg of 2C-I, as well as some other research chemicals.<BR>
<BR>
It was not until the night before I was leaving to return to India that I decided to try the 2C-I.  I had not tried the other chemicals yet either because frankly I was a bit nervous about it.<BR>
<BR>
As for my drug background, I smoke marijuana daily, and I take cocaine occasionally.  At this time, I had just returned from a vacation in the Caribbean where I did quite a bit of coke for about a week straight.  It was a day or 2 later so I was not feeling any effects of the coke.<BR>
<BR>
I have taken E twice and both times it had no effect on me while my friends were tripping their heads off.  I have also tried acid 3 times and it did not affect me.  I am not sure if these drugs just do not affect me or if I just did not take enough.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, the experience with 2C-I was like the ecstasy experience I never had...<BR>
<BR>
Preparation:<BR>
I had 100mg of this stuff and this is a very small amount of off-white colored crystals.  The crystals are very sparkly and also very sticky.  It is difficult to work with and I had no accurate way to measure it, so I measured out 200ml of water and dissolved the entire 100mg of powder.  I shook it up for a long time.  It did not dissolve easily at all.  I let it sit for the day while I went out to dinner with my family.<BR>
<BR>
The Experience:<BR>
I had a couple of glasses of wine with dinner so I decided to wait a bit before taking the 2C-I.  I was already a little nervous because I was leaving for India the next day and would not be back for another 6 months.  I still had a little bit of packing to do and I was also a bit stressed because I had not received my visa yet.  I was supposed to receive it the same morning I was to leave so there was always the chance I could miss my flight.  Anyway, what I'm trying to say is these were not the ideal circumstances to take this chemical, but I did not want to take it with me to India, so I had to try it at least once before I left.<BR>
<BR>
I measured out about 10ml, or 5mg, of the solution and drank it.  I rinsed it and made sure to get any residue from the shot glass I was using.  It was about 12:30AM at this point and my family was asleep.  I was still packing and I tossed on Napoleon Dynamite, which is a really trippy movie anyway.<BR>
<BR>
I read online that it may take awhile to kick in, so I waited almost an hour.  I did not feel much so I took about another 10mg (20ml).  After about 10 more minutes, I started to get that funny feeling like 'oh shit, something's happening'.  I tried to relax and sat down to watch the movie for a bit.  I drank a few glasses of water, something I normally do when I start to feel nervous during a trip.<BR>
<BR>
After another 1/2 hour or so (about 1.5 hours from the first dose), I really started to feel the effects of this powerful drug.  I was nervous because it was impossible to ignore the effects.  It was winter time and my room was a bit cold.  My body became hypersensitive to this and I bundled up in sweatshirt and pants, etc.  My skin was very sensitive to the touch and it felt good to rub my hands together and on my arms and legs.<BR>
<BR>
I started feeling very happy and also a little psychotic at the same time.  It was a crazy, giddy sort of happiness.  When I checked myself out in the mirror my pupils were huge.  I did not really have any open eye visuals, certainly nothing that would qualify as a hallucination.  To me, it seemed like what ecstasy was supposed to be like.  I had a lot of energy and felt like dancing to loud music (which I could unfortunately not do because everyone in the house was sleeping).<BR>
<BR>
It was also easy to get lost in thought.  I found myself thinking about past experiences in my life and just feeling compassion for everyone I ever knew.  I thought about how much I loved my family and got really emotional.  But then I quickly snapped out of it and got into a crazy, energetic mood again.  I had to play my guitar for a bit, and then something a little embarrassing happened.  I just could not resist hunting some porn and pleasuring myself.  I wish I could have shared the experience with a female.  The sexual energy was so intense, I could vividly fantasize about what I wanted.<BR>
<BR>
This is when I discovered the closed-eye visuals.  When I closed my eyes, it was like a random, bizzare-o dream world.  I honestly cannot describe it, but it made perfect sense in my mind.  I remember seeing these flowers that had women's heads in the middle, surrounded by the petals, like in a cartoon.  They were smiling at me and sending me telepathic messages.  This was around 3-4 hours into the experience and I really was feeling the full effects.  I laid in my bed with heavy blankets but I could not fall asleep.  When I closed my eyes, I went back to my fantasy world.  It actually felt like I was leaving my body.<BR>
<BR>
I basically went into this world and talked to the flower ladies.  We didn't say much, just sat and smiled at each other and felt wonderful.  I would take off on a whim of a thought and come back here and there but I distinctly remember these flower ladies.<BR>
<BR>
At some point I finally did fall asleep but it was not for a good 6 hours after I took the first dose, and I was still tripping.  The next morning I felt very aloof.  My body felt a little out of synch with my brain.  I just kind of felt drained by the whole experience, but it was very lovely and interesting.<BR>
<BR>
Summary:<BR>
2c-I is a very powerful chemical.  I have a naturally high tolerance to most drugs I have tried and this had a very strong effect on me.  It can make me really think objectively about my life and my goals and analyze myself.  I have studied out of body experiences (astral projection) and have even successfully had them, but this chemical went beyond just looking at myself sleeping.  When I closed my eyes, I really felt like I was in another world.<BR>
<BR>
The sexual energy and body high of this drug is really nice too.  Next time I go back to the US, I hope I can get a female friend of mine to trip on this with me.  It feels to me like how people normally describe ecstasy. I never lost control of my thoughts completely but I could see with a higher dosage how it would be easy to let the body high take me over.  <BR>
<BR>
The other intimidating thing about 2C-I is the duration of the trip.  I tripped for at least a good 5 hours.  So when I get that 'oh shit' feeling, I know it's going to be with me for awhile.  By the time it wore off, I sort of missed the feeling though.<BR>
<BR>
I enjoyed my trip immensely.<!--   End Body   -->

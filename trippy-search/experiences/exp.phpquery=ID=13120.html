My experience of experimenting with mind-altering substances has been fairly good, except for the following trip I’m about to explain.<BR>
<BR>
It all started on a fairly warm March day. It was Friday and I had been suspended that day for leaving school earlier that week. I enjoyed my day home from school mostly by playing video games on my computer, until my friends were out of school. I had made plans to party with some of them that night, and so I called them around 2:30pm.<BR>
<BR>
After a short conversation, I left my house and headed out towards their house. I had a small bag of pot, maybe a 15 sac at the most. I stopped into the woods shortly to smoke a bowl to myself, before arriving at my friend’s house. When I got to my friend’s house, we went to her upstairs were she lives alone to chill with 2 other friends who were already up there. My friend Jason had an 8th and so we mixed are weed together and rolled 2 cannon sized joints, which we smoked. After that I was pretty stoned, and Jason was even more stoned. Then my other friend Shannon said that she would be right back because she has to run an errand. Jason and me went outside and walked around until she got back.<BR>
<BR>
When she got back she had with her 7 blotter stamps of acid. We went back inside and she took 2 hits of acid, and handed me and Jason each 2 hits. I was already stoned by now, but I figured what the hell, and I took both hits. After about an hour my high from the weed was coming down, and I was not feeling the acid at all. Shannon was in the other room listening to music, and Jason and me were just chilling in the kitchen waiting for the acid to kick in. At about 5:30 (an hour and 10 minutes after I took the acid) I began to feel the effects rapidly kick in. <BR>
<BR>
I began to see the room sway very quickly, and when I looked at Jason he just diminished into nothing. I could still hear him talking but I visually could not see him. I began to panic and so I stood up, and he re-appeared. Only this time he was very blocky looking, almost as if he was a sprite in a badly rendered video game. By now he was also tripping off the acid, and was repeating his name over and over.<BR>
<BR>
At about 6:15 I was seeing very intense visuals. The room had departed itself from the rest of the house, and was now an inner chamber where only the sinners who abuse drugs go. I suddenly had a strong feeling to leave the room or I would die like the rest of the sinners. I got up and could not even walk straight. I managed to make it to the next room where Shannon was laying on the bed, and looking at a poster. She began talking to me, but her words meant nothing to me. They were all distorted, and because of the fact, that I could not understand what she was saying, I felt as if she was going to try and trick me into doing something, where I would get hurt.<BR>
<BR>
I had very intense feelings to leave the house. My mind was telling me that the people in that house were going to die, and only I could help them. I began to fall into a dreamy state where I envisioned my friends in that house decapitated and dead. When I would go back into the house to make sure they are all right, things would look normal, but not feel normal. I heard voices telling me to help them or they would die. I rushed into the house and told them to get out of the house as fast as possible. They told me I was fucking crazy and to shut the hell up. I explained my visions of what I saw and heard, and they told me I was just tripping too hard. Hearing this put me into a very depressed state. I was depressed because I could not view things in the psychological way that I was just doing before they told me I was just tripping.<BR>
<BR>
Since my parents were gone until later that night, I decided to go home for a little bit and mellow out. I left at about 7:00pm, and took a walk home that was un-forgettable. The 15-minute walk seemed as if it took 2 hours, and everything was just in a hazy dazed state. When I got home, I went straight to my room and sat down to relax. I couldn’t relax though. I felt guilty, as if I failed my friends in helping them. Then the worst part of my trip began. As my guilt and fear got bigger, I decided I might have to kill myself, to release the guilt. Suddenly a large and unexplainable amount of fear came over me. It was the kind of fear as if, you know someone is about to do something very harmful and hateful to you and there is nothing you can do to stop them.<BR>
<BR>
I began to panic, and ran for my bed, were I went under the covers and tried to sleep. I could not sleep though, I felt as if somebody was watching me, and when I looked out from my covers I saw a large shadow on the wall.<BR>
<BR>
My fear diminished and I began to feel excited and confident, that everything is fine. The shadow began to take form into a real mass, not just a shadow. Yet it had shadow traits, it still looked like a shadow but it was 3 dimensional, and had eyes and talked. It was a very fearful thing to look at, and my fear quickly overcame me again. The shadow figure told me his name was Omeg and he was here to punish me for not helping my friends. I was so scared I began to cry and pray that my trip would just end. I told the shadow figure that I was just tripping on acid and it was just a visual. This reassured me for a little bit of time, but fear returned when the visual shadow figure would not go away. He told me a visual is not able to do what is happening to my mind now, and he reminded me of the fact that my friends were all dead.<BR>
<BR>
In a rush of fear I sprung up, put my shoes on and left the house. I had no idea what time it was, but it was dark. I went back to my friend’s house I was previously at, and chilled there for a while. The next few hours I experienced very vivid color patterns and visuals streaming through my head at one time. I feared with every new color scheme that entered my mind, that Omeg the shadow man would return. At about 5:30am I came down off of the acid, and remained in a dazed state for the next few days, thinking of the last trip.<BR>
<BR>
I have never done acid since, in fear that Omeg would return. Where I possibly could have imaged Omeg in my mind is still a mystery, but I have learned that mind and mind setting is always important before taking acid. When I took the acid on the trip I just explained, I did not think about what effects were gonna effect me at all. Now I know better.<!--   End Body   -->

I have forever been a supporter of the 'overhydration method', since it has worked for me on multiple occasions over the last 10 years or so, however, the method failed to do the job this time. While some 'experts' may say I missed a step or two in the method, not all of the steps have been neccesary in the past, my mistake was relying on an old method  that has barely been changed or modified in any way, while drug testing chemistry HAS improved. The steps I took:<BR>
<BR>
High fibre diet<BR>
Full hydration for several days BEFORE the test<BR>
Overhydration the day of the test (test was taken appx. 4 in the afternoon)<BR>
Electrolyte consumption, using 'Pedialite' <BR>
Sodium replacement with sports drinks<BR>
Small doses of creatine<BR>
Multi-vitamin regiment<BR>
<BR>
I still pissed hot for THC.<BR>
<BR>
After being informed of the failure, outrage and anger at the possibility of failing a drug test did nothing to help my case, nor did demanding a re-test. I was informed by the company that I would not be granted another screening, that they would only re-test the same sample. I was also informed by the company that this did not destroy my chances of working for them again in the future, I'd just have to pass another drug test after 6 months. <BR>
<BR>
Even after I informed them that the urine sample was technically NULL-AND-VOID (because I'd automatically flushed after filling the cup) but was allowed to be used anyway (the head nurse happened to walk in when I informed the tech that I'd flushed, and she ok'ed it, saying that as long as the temp. was correct it would be 'ok'), did nothing for my cause. In the end, I even went as far as to offer to pay for the re-test myself, at a different collection clinic of course, didn't matter.<BR>
<BR>
Overconfidence cost me a VERY well paying job, now I am still stuck with 2 part time jobs getting paid shit due to my lackadaisical attitude towards drug screenings.<!--   End Body   -->

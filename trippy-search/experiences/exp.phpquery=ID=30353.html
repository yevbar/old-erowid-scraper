DPT has was an incredible trip for me, truly life changing and fulfulling. It's been called Dr. Pepper, due to its strikingly similar appearence to coke and the fact that one of the best methods of ingesting is insufflation. However, I have to describe its selflessness a polar opposite from cocaine's 'ego inflation'. <BR>
<BR>
I snorted 50 mg and sat back to let the drug take hold of me. Luckily a friend was with me to provide emotional (and ambiental) reassurance that everything is ok (it always is), having read some quite terrifying reports on this substance. Immediately after insufflation I felt quite unsteady, almost like riding in the back of a truck on a bumpy road. My body was quite accelerated and my mind had no idea what was going on in the present or what was about to occur.<BR>
   <BR>
About 20 minutes after I dosed, I laid down on my bed and gazed at the ceiling. At first nothing, and then the typical crazy visuals that tryptamines provide. But I kept looking deeper and deeper into them and images, visages began to appear. These danced swiftly along the ceiling as colors began to emerge from what was once a plain white space. The full spectrum of light began to ebb and flow. Honestly, I was a bit frightened, having never had such 'true' hallucination. My heart rate shot up and I began to worry about my physical safety. Due to the reassuring lyrics from Phish's 'Bug', 'It doesn't matter' I was able to step outside that box and calm down. This was the moment of my DPT death.<BR>
<BR>
For the next hour I felt completely void of emotion, perception  as my mind was totally dissasociated from my body and my soul escaped from my mind. I walked around outside, feeling nothing (which yeah is a feeling in itself). My friend handed me a dandelion and I've never been so removed from the beauty of this world. She asked if I was ok, and I couldn't respond, not being able to conceive of the such an ego we normally possess. <BR>
   <BR>
We walked back in and I writhed around on the floor like a cat, amazed at the sound a vaccuum cleaner was making in the hallway. My worldly perception was trailing back, as this was the moment of my conception. The sperm and the egg together once again.<BR>
   <BR>
I put on Jethro Tull's Thick as a Brick. There's no doubt in my mind that this was one of the most amazing listening experiences of my life. It was like I was in the womb and hearing music for the first time. The unique instrumentation of the music appeared in front of me Simply amazing. The thought still gives me chills. Slowly during the album thoughts of the self began to reemerge. My friend felt my hand and told me it was cold, and I was able to conceive of me having a hand, but not the sensation of cold just yet. I responded to her comment with a 'No.'<BR>
   <BR>
About an hour and a half as I was returning to existence I felt complete happiness from the sheer beauty and love life has to offer. I told my friend that I was so glad she was alive and that we knew each other. I felt like my psyche had just been purified, my emotions consummated. This euphoria lasted all night and into the next day. I believe it has never left me. I look back on the experience as one of the greatest moments of my life thus far. I caught a glimpse at the realm of the true perfection that this world exists in. I am left with a profound understanding of what it means to be alive.<!--   End Body   -->

While not my first experience with codeine, this was certainly the most interesting. I took four Tylenol-3 tablets, each with 300mg acetaminophen, 30mg codeine, and 15mg caffeine. The tablets were leftovers from getting my wisdom teeth out. Well, here I am in first year University, faced with eleven days between final exams, so I figured why not experiment with my leftover pharmaceuticals.<br>
<br>
The night before this experience I had consumed two tablets and felt minor effects, but they may have been modified because I spent a few hours roaming around outside in the cold. Because of this I didn't really get a feeling of warmth, as Ontario in December is not warm. I was walking around with a roommate and exploring and attempted to saw down a tree with a switchblade. That was unsuccessful but the entire night felt very giddy and I was very content. I remember being tired and thinking I could lay down anywhere to sleep. I went to bed around 6:30am.<br>
<br>
The following night I took four tablets, as I said, and experienced dramatic effects. I had been puttering around in my room doing various cleaning. I'd had quite the stacks of papers and notes and random bits scattered around and felt the need to get that part of my life in order, so I set to work doing that and took the tablets during that time. Not long after I began to feel warm and drowsy and not quite myself, and I looked at the clock to see it was about 12:40am. Now, having had my sleeping pattern lately as going to bed at 6am, waking up at 4-6pm, I welcomed this opportunity to correct it and went to bed.<br>
<br>
I remember feeling extremely content bundled up under the covers, very warm and happy. Before I get onto specifics I would like to note that I did experience a few adverse effects, namely dry mouth (had a glass of water nearby, though), and slight momentary nausea if I was shifting in bed to get more comfortable.<br>
<br>
Things started with me experiencing very vivid memories, or at least it seems like they were memories. It felt like I was accessing information that normally would be filtered out or left behind in my brain, so the memories were very complete and true to life. Makes me think that our brain records a complete record of all events we ever go through but that we simply cannot access most of the information, usually. I seem to recall the memories being a sort of live action memory, and then they would eventually spin off into huge, meandering new scenarios of events. Now, this is not unusual for me as my dreams most usually take the form of dreaming up situations and scenarios and strange worlds. But the intensity and complexity of these experiences were amazing, truly engaging and I was very much kept interested.<br>
<br>
I did get unsettled now and again, at one point I heard some noise or another in my building, a pipe of flowing water or the like, and it startled me. The wind whooshing through the window screen and hitting the side of the building also produced a shrieking like sounds that made my mind race momentarily, but it was only for a split second that I felt scared or alarmed. It did not build into an unpleasant tide, but merely alarm and fear at the precise instant. I remember slipping in and out of sleep and the experiences washing over me regardless of waking.<br>
<br>
Interesting also is that I was unable to sleep for a sustained time until 5:30am, perhaps because of the 60mg of caffeine, but I suspect not, as a strong cup of coffee usually only seems to effect me for about an hour. Despite taking the tablets at about 12:15am, I remember looking at the clock at 5:30am, and did not fall asleep immediately after that, either.<br>
<br>
I was surprised by the power of the experience - I think that maybe the dose of two tablets the night before may have served to 'warm up' for this experience with four tablets, and left me more susceptible to its effects, but I could be mistaken. Having taken two and only feeling 'whooshy,' taking four seemed to introduce exponential effects. Very interesting, would do again. I have six more here and am debating how to split up the doses.<!--   End Body   -->

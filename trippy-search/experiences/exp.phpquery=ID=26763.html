I had taken Benadryl before. The first time I ever took them, I took 5. I felt a slight head change and enjoyed the feeling. Each time I took Benadryl, I increased the amount I took. The second time, I took 8, the third, 12, and the last time I took them, I took 15 and tripped out.<br>
<br>
Heres the story:<br>
<br>
One morning, after talking to my boyfriend, I wanted to get high and I didn't care how. I didn't have anything around the house, nor any money. Right next door to me is a general store. So, I walked over there and glanced through the medicine. I spotted a box of Benadryl Allergy. As I reached the steps to my house and stepped in the door, I noticed that my parents were gone. I decided now would be the best time to take them. Walking back to my room, pulling the box out of my pocket, I look over them and wonder how many to take. I figured since I took 12 the last time, I should up my dosage. I count out 15 and break them out of the protective seal. I grabbed my glass of water and took all 15 at once.<br>
<br>
After I took them, I checked the time and it was around 11:14am. I went and layed on my bed waiting for them to kick in. Well, as I lay there, I started to feel extremely tired. I glanced over at the clock once more and noticed that a good 20 minutes had went by and I didn't feel anything. I decided I would go to sleep since I felt so tired. I turned over and closed my eyes. I slept for what felt like hours on top of hours, but when I had woke up, I looked over and noticed I was only asleep for exactly 7 mintues. I looked around and noticed I had a head change and couldn't stop twitching. I sat up and I felt like I had bugs crawling all over me, so I jumped up and started smacking myself all over my body.<br>
<br>
After I had realized there was nothing on me, I sat back down and I started having tremors. My left arm would jerk, and feel like it was falling asleep and I had to constantly move it. I layed down on the bed and tried to go back to sleep, but I had failed. I was tripping out bad. I felt itchy all over my body and when I would goto scratch, my whole body would jump and jerk before it would allow me to scratch. I gave up on trying to go to sleep and I stood up walking into the kitchen. I noticed I was stumbling as I walked and my vision was extremely blurry and I couldn't even read the cereal I had grabbed from the cabinet. I stood there for a minute trying to make it out and started to feel like I wanted to just jump out of my skin. I couldn't stand still. I had to walk around and swing my arms around or else it felt like they went to sleep. <br>
<br>
By now it was about quarter til' noon and the effects were strong. I was worried my parents would come home and see me acting like a complete fool swinging my arms around and shaking my legs as I walked. I kept walking around the house for a good hour and a half. The effects slowly started wearing off and my body was twitching and jerking as bad as it was. I started walking to my room and all of a sudden, my arm had a spasm and slung out, hitting the wall, and me having no control. I screamed in pain because our walls have them pointy things on them(not sure what it's called). I looked at my hand and noticed it was bleeding, but didn't care and continued walking to my room.<br>
<br>
When I got into my room, I shut the door and fell face first onto my bed. I wanted to goto sleep so the drugs effects would go away. I turned over laying on my back and closed my eyes. My legs started to feel like they were going to sleep before I was and it would make me jerk my legs. I tried to ignore the feeling and successfully fell asleep. After I woke up, I looked at the clock and it was 2 in the morning and I was up all night. That was the first time the effects from the drug had been like that. I didn't like my body twitching and jerking and me not being able to control it. But over all, I loved it.<!--   End Body   -->

I had recently placed an order online thinking I was ordering DPT. Well I at times happen to be a careless person and I neglected to note the additional 'iso' in the name here. Instead of purchasing DPT I ended up buying DiPT. And yet, I got a most excellent experience. <br>
<br>
I (again, thinking it was DPT) put what I eyeball to be 25mg of it in a lightbulb vaporizer. My crystals melt to oil, which vaporizes into my lungs. <br>
<br>
I find everything has a beautifully deep tonal quality. Every song sounds new. Its like my entire music library is anew. When I listen to a song and I hear multiple people singing at once, its almost as if all those are separated. Yet I hear them all at once. Vision seems clear, there is a certain clarity to everything. I feel shaky. But its not a bad thing. If there is a rhythm to be found my body will locate it. I joined with the music. I let the music take me. I lay back, listen. I can create my own powerful symphony. It was the bell in a cathedral that eventually spread outward and blanketed the whole earth with its melodious sound. All from inside. <br>
<br>
Vaporization is a fine way to enjoy this harmonious compound, I do declare. I've never felt this connected to a drug. It's so perfect. It just dives me right into the music. Imagine having a layer of your life removed so you can see underneath it. A whole new world is under here. While the audio effects are very cool, the psychological and body effects need to be mentioned.<br>
<br>
Firstly, I did notice nausea via this administration. It seems to subside after a while. But honestly early on I wanted to just lay there. I took some TUMS. Those help. I got kinda gassy for some reason. Second, The stuff stanks. It really does. It doesn't make me throw up, but it ain't far off. <br>
<br>
As far as mental effects. Its actually got some potential here. I haven't seen much smoked so far, but I have had some CEV's and if I just zone out some line based visuals. Also, vision tends to get wavy and distorted.<!--   End Body   -->

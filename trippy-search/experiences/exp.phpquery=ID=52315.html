I am a 15 year old 65kg male.<BR>
<BR>
Prior to this experiment I had tried both substances. I acquired the Methylphenidate (Ritalin, or R's as they are known here) from a friend with ADHD. The coffee came from the kitchen.<BR>
<BR>
I prepared by crushing the contents of two capsules of the aforementioned substance into a fine powder, and, after locking my bedroom door to assure myself of complete safety from discovery, made one line of it, and snorted it in one go. I would say it stung a bit, but it was absolutely nothing in comparison to some other rather peculiar antihistamines I have snorted.* <BR>
<BR>
(*It is the most painful thing I have ever done. I would rather have my limbs hacked off with a blunt machete.)<BR>
<BR>
My mindset was slightly depressed, hopeful that this would aid my mood (for however long), for I had used it for that purpose before successfully (although at smaller doses). Very little fear, because of my familiarity, and quite tired (insomnia).<BR>
<BR>
I had drunk the coffee 30 minutes previous and snorted the 'R's' at 5:30. I had a slight headache from some Promethazine I had taken the day before to fall asleep (130mg oral), but I don't feel that it had any (save the disappearance of the headache) impact on the experience.<BR>
<BR>
At first, after snorting, I had the usual placebo feeling of elation about the coming experience, and also a slight feeling of dread, strange as it is to say, for I was wondering if perhaps this dose was to large for insufflations. My nasal passage and upper throat felt as though they were inflamed (not painfully) or enlarged, so I was a little worried that I would asphyxiate or have to tell my parents. It never became painful or to bothersome, and it subsided very quickly after I ate dinner (I ate before the appetite depressing effects came about, so no nausea). By the way this is not usual.<BR>
<BR>
At approximately 5:55pm, I could distinctly feel the effects of the drug. For me, it is a pleasant feeling of concentration and sociability, combined with a great euphoria. Wonderfully pleasing, especially compared to my otherwise rather dull life.<BR>
<BR>
Probably the most pleasing aspect of the entire experience was the fantastic leaps and bounds I made in bonding with my fellow siblings. Normally, in a tired and grumpy state, I find annoyance in my brother and sister very quickly, but now I could tolerate the most pestering occurrences without even considering retaliation in any form. I conversed extensively with my little sister on the relevance of Christianity (she is 8) and then watched a Led Zeppelin DVD with my little brother, discussing every movement of Jimmy Page's holy hands, and every gaily effeminate movement of Robert Plant, for hours.<BR>
<BR>
At approximately 9:30 everyone was in bed. I went into my room, where I 'pulled a Descartes' so to say, or wrote down what I knew, 'I am thinking therefore I exist', and drew very enlightening (although very materialistic) conclusions from this knowledge. I was awake until 4 the next morning, and experienced something I call 'concentrating my self to sleep'. Incredible, but it had never occurred before.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, highly pleasant, with no come down or anything, due to the fact I slept that part off. Normally the experience is accompanied by an afterglow of a few hours, and then a crash, which feels as though you are very tired but calm (it is pleasant for me).<BR>
<BR>
I enjoyed every part of this experiment, and will do again, although being very wary of addiction. I do this about once or twice a month now, and I have no trouble with physical addiction, as my friend will give it to me no more than this (a good pal).<!--   End Body   -->

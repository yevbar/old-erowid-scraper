The following story happened yesterday and I still feel the after effects as I write this. I'm a 17 year old girl who drinks occasionally and I used to smoke mersh every few days during the summer before school. Our school does 'random' drug testing so I decided to stay clean for the sake of graduating.<br>
<br>
Well, last night I went over to an old guy friend's house with one of my girl friends. This guy's friend was sitting on the bed smoking a joint and he offered us a hit and my girl friend declined, but I thought 'What the hell? I'm graduating in 3 months, my boyfriend of 2 years just broke up with me, and I'm really stressed out.' My friend said it wasn't a good idea but she let me make one of the biggest mistakes of my life. The guy had told me it was chronic; I've never smoked chronic but my friends have so I didn't think it would be much different. <br>
<br>
Right after I took the first hit, I coughed for about 5 minutes straight. It was a nasty cough too, and it hurt my chest. I was offered another hit but declined because I was coughing, or else I would've gone for it. Everything was going fine afterwards and I figured it would hit me later, and I would feel as if I was smoking mersh and drinking vodka. Well, probably about 15 minutes later, it hit me. It totally caught me off guard; everything I saw slowed down but time sped up. What felt like 5 minutes was really just a minute. I started getting antsy and I would pick at my sweatshirt and twitch constantly. I tried to be casual about it and I told them it was strong and asked what was in it. The guy told me it was laced with PCP. Right then and there, I flipped out and got 10 times more anxious than I was before. They told me it was going to be fine and it would wear off in 30 minutes. One of the guys gave me food to help me come down off of it but it was only getting worse. <br>
<br>
I took the hit at about 11 PM and I had to be home by 12. So we left around 11:30 and I had to be walked to the car. It was cold outside but I couldn't feel the temperature. It felt like room temperature. I was doing okay in the car, still seeing things slowly but I was thinking it was wearing off. I was VERY wrong.<br>
<br>
Being in a car only made it worse and I couldn't feel anything when my friend was driving. So I told her to hold my hand so I know I'm still alive. Never taking hard drugs before, I really thought I was going to die. Sometimes I'd get really antsy then other times I would just have a blank stare at the road. All of the moving must have had a weird effect on me, because I started shaking violently, and I felt myself slipping away from reality. I thought I was having a seizure so my friend pulled over and it didn't take me too long to calm down. From there on I closed my eyes and my friend had to squeeze my hand because I couldn't feel myself anymore. When I got home she walked me to my room because I was very dizzy and it was hard looking at things without getting freaked out.<br>
<br>
As I was laying down in my bed, I tried to sleep but couldn't. I was really nervous and then that's when things got weird. I was once again slipping away from reality but I didn't feel any part of my body whatsoever. I was having some weird out of body experience and I felt like I was floating above myself, watching myself lay there motionless. This went on for quite a while; I would slip back and forth into reality and I noticed it was wearing off. Each episode of unconsciousness became shorter so I tried to enjoy it but I was still very anxious. I was still tweaking, unable to get any sleep. It finally ended just like it started at about 2:30 AM. It happened very suddenly and I felt like I fell out of the sky or something. I couldn't get over how disturbing of an experience that was.<br>
<br>
Today has been weird; I am still twitching and I sometimes will feel my muscles tense up randomly. My vision is a little off, close to tunnel vision. I also have been yelling at my mom every time I talk to her and sometimes I will get randomly confused. <br>
That is definately one experience I will never EVER relive again.<!--   End Body   -->

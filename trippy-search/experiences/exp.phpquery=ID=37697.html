It's a Saturday night and all of my friends are either out of town or busy. I come home from work a little after 8 pm, and decide to take some of the amphetamine I bought recently, while on vacation. I open up a 30 mg extended-release Adderall and place a very small dose (probably about 5 mg) on a moistened fingertip. I chew the sweet-and-sour crystals, and pack a bowl of good homegrown to pass the time until the amphetamine hits. I'm talking on the phone when I notice my thoughts becoming much clearer, and I begin to chatter a bit. I get off the phone and smoke four more bowls over the course of the next hour, the last one laced with a small amount of hash.<br>
<br>
After smoking the fifth bowl, I decide to play my classical guitar. I absent-mindedly fingerpick the stings, playing a mildly difficult piece I've been trying to learn for the past few weeks. Everything comes out exactly right, without any sort of effort. I think this a bit odd and continue to play. I realize the proportions of the room are grossly exaggerated; it feels like I'm about 20 feet away from my computer desk when I'm really only about 2 feet away.<br>
<br>
I decide to go for a walk. I pick a CD, put on my boots, and head out the door. I walk for awhile, my thoughts spinning in a million different directions at once. My brain will latch onto a word in the lyrics of the music I'm listening to and issue a stream of thought related to it. My mouth is incredibly dry, so I go into a gas station I walk past to buy a bottle of water. The girl behind the counter says 'hi' to me, I respond with an absent stare and a distant 'hello.' I lower my head and she again says 'hi,' and when I look up at her she is giving me a strange stare. She gives me my change and I quickly exit, giggling.<br>
<br>
At some point, it began to rain, and light was refracted through the drops on my glasses. I saw this as an interesting patterning of light, unlike anything I've seen on any psychedelic. If I stared long enough at the light, I noticed it was comprised of smaller, kaleidoscope-like patterns. After noticing these patterns, I began to see shifting bands of light and darkness on the pavement all around me, reminding me of the visuals I got the first few times I took mushrooms, but sped up.<br>
<br>
I'm also feeling incredidbly speedy, moreso than I think I should from such a small dose. My jaw is clenching and unclenching and I'm playing with everything in my pockets and drumming on my stomach as I walk around. The muscles in my legs are very tight, as they often are while I'm speeding.<br>
<br>
There is an intense introspective push, very cannibas-like, but much stonger than I've ever experienced from marijuana. A lot has been going on in my life lately; I had come to an important juncture a few days previously. I had the opportunity to move to Oregon, but decided to stick it out in the place I live. I mulled over this decision, pondering it from many different angles, and came to the conclusion that it was the right one. There were a few other flashes of insight into other things, as well.<br>
<br>
I walked around until almost 3 am, and came home, took a wonderful shower, and smoked some more. I felt the amphetamine effects weakening and the desire to sleep overcame me about 5 hours after I took the Adderall. I don't know why this combination was so psychedelic, but I am going to explore it further.<!--   End Body   -->

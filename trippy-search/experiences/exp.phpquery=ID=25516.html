I've been gettin really bored lately since i can't find any of the common drugs around my area.  I realized, hey my parents have all kinds of drugs around here.  I looked through the cabinent and found some zoloft.  It had warning labels for drowziness and that you shouldn't drive while using so I thought hey its gotta do somim.  I took it alone.  I was watchin up in smoke in my basement and took the 3 pills at about 6 o'clock.  I decided on 3 because the perscription was for 1 a day so I didn't want to go too far.  Now I havn't really done much besides weed and a few other perscription drugs so I my comparisons may be a bit off.<br>
<br>
At about 7 o'clock I started feelin really tired and started yawning alot, it was odd because every time I yawned I felt like I had to cry then my jaw would tremble like I was really cold.  This was all that happened till about 10:00 when I started feelin kinda dizzy.  Nottin much else happened for a bit so I decided to just go to bed early at 11:00.  When I laid down in bed I found that I was wide awake all of a sudden, but I was still yawning like crazy with that odd urge to cry.  I tried reading but I couldn't focus on the page.  I just sorta laid there for bout an hour thinkin bout stuff.<br>
<br>
At bout midnight I was startin to get restless.  I would just convulse for no reason and I had to keep rolling around.  Then at about 12:30 I started feelin really odd.  I was gettin really bored but I didn't want to do anything.  I did have the urge to talk to someone though but no one was up.  As I laid in bed and stared at my ceiling I noticed that there where all these black lines forming on it.  It as really weird and I couldn't stare at it or it hurt my eyes.  I turned my light on then started gettin really mad at it for some reason so I turned it off.  Then I noticed an out of place shadow on my ceiling and I got really mad at that too, I almost yelled at it then I remembered everyone is asleep lol.<br>
<br>
All this stuff went on till about 3:00 when I decided it was time to try and get some sleep.  It was an odd sleep.  I would sleep for bout an hour then wake up and fall asleep again.  When I got up the next mornin I figured it was over, then that yawning stuff started.  I got up bout 9:00 and I was just really relaxed.  I didn't seem to be bugged by anything all day.  I played warcraft(a computer game) for a bit and noticed I didn't get mad at it when I lost like I usually do.  I had trouble focusing though so I just sat on the couch and chilled all day.  That night I was wide awake again and I had to force myself to get some sleep.  Well its now the third day and I guess its waring off now although I still feel pretty relaxed.  This is somim that I'll probly try again, although I'll do with a freind since I got that really bad urge to talk to someone.<!--   End Body   -->

<!--  First of all I would like to say that my experiences with all pyschedelics have been nothing short of magical and that I support what Erowid and organizations like it are doing for them. Promoting public awareness of these compounds is exactly what is needed to turn some heads in Congress and other governments.<BR>
<BR>
Anyways to my tale of misfortune...<BR>
<BR>
  -->

This happened to a close friend of mine (seriously, it wasn't me), I’ll call him F. You also must understand that finding mushrooms in our area is about as difficult as performing open heart surgery on yourself. <BR>
<BR>
After F's second experience with mushrooms (the two were spaced roughly 3 months apart) F decided that he desired to explore the effects of mushrooms much more frequently then the availability in our small community would allow. Being an educated individual, he researched mushroom cultivation thoroughly and decided on using the PF-Tek method of cultivation. After ordering the proper materials required for the project he set out to grow his own personal crop.<BR>
<BR>
You must also understand that F does not live alone, still in school he lives in a common household with several other individuals. There is S who was informed of the plan from the start because S is F's roommate. The other occupants B and M, were not informed of F's activities.<BR>
<BR>
Well, time passed slowly and F's project yielded its first flush, a healthy one, approximately 30g dried. A few days after his first 5g dose (plus three test doses of 1/2g, 1g and 1 1/2g to insure safety and strength) he was left with 22g of suprisingly potent mushrooms.<BR>
<BR>
F being a generous caring fellow offered these dried mushrooms to B and M. B and M did not appreciate the idea of mushrooms being cultivated in their household and threatened F that, if all 22g plus the terrarium were not gone in 24 hrs. they would call the police and have him charged.<BR>
<BR>
So all of F's work and money was wasted as he burnt the 22gs in the fireplace along with all six of his substrate cakes.<BR>
<BR>
<!--  Now you are wondering, what can I (the potential cultivator) learn from this. First, make sure that this is worth the risk to you. Where we live, the penalty is three years maximum for cultivation of mushrooms, [parole after 6 months], in other areas I'm sure there are more severe penalties. Second, ensure that all of the members of the household you live in are ok with your plans and their consequences, because negligence is not an excuse in the eyes of the law, they are just as guilty as you. Third, be prepared for the worst that can possibly happen, because it will, I gar-un-tee it! Other then that, cultivation can be a rewarding activity that produces considerable results for a relatively cheap investment.  -->

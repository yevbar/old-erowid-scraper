The first time I tried DXM, I was at work. I had been partying all night, and I needed something to pick me up, and caffeine wasn't doing the trick. I had heard through friends that Robitussin could make you trip, and I was really curious. So during my break I grabbed a bottle of Robitussin DM Max Strength. <BR>
<BR>
Following the initial experience, I wasn't too impressed. I hadn't taken more than half, and the taste was quite nauseating. But for some reason I was on the quest to do more. I began taking it on weekends, when there was nothing to do, and on days I had off, for fun. I grew to like the Robo Trip. Until my friends found out. <BR>
<BR>
I was under constant scrutiny, because they were sure I was reaching addiction. For a period of 3 months, DXM was all I did, despite what anyone said. But I had an awful experience that prompted me to stop, cold turkey.<BR>
<BR>
I was at a friends house one night, and we were lounging around, the guy I have liked forever was there, and we got on the subject of the Robo Trip. It got me thinking about the bottle that was in my purse, and I excused myself, went to the bathroom and drank the whole bottle. When I returned, T asked me what I did. My best friend looked at me, and said 'she just drank a bottle'. T was amazed that I carried it around with me, so he went to the bathroom, and grabbed another bottle, and coaxed me to drink it.<BR>
<BR>
In an hour, he decided to take us out, and I was tripping pretty hard. His car was stuck in snow, and I had to help push it out. I started to go catatonic. They were so worried about me, and I desperately wished to tell them I was okay, I had auditory hallucinations as well as visual, swirling in my head, and I wasn't really in a talking mood.<BR>
<BR>
I came to realize so many things that night, I cried myself to sleep. The worst thing of all was the depression seeping in, uninvited. I was upset for days afterwards. <BR>
<BR>
T convinced me not to do it anymore, because he did not like the person I had become because of it, and truthfully, neither did I. <BR>
<BR>
So kids, if you're looking for a way to get your kicks, stay with the tried and true standard--Marijuana.<!--   End Body   -->

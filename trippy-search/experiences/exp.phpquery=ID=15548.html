I had heard alot about morning glory seeds, but what convinced me to give them a try were Mckenna's interesting accounts of their effects (toltec patterns and whatnot). Well, I wasn't quite sold, since I knew that un-treated seeds were difficult to obtain, and my only previous experience had been with some psilocybin, but that's beside the point; I was intrigued. I obtained them (the seeds) in powdered form from my friend Andrew, he said there were about 300 seeds in the bag. <BR>
<BR>
I went home with the seeds that night (after a party at Andrew's, where I had consumed some Kava tea), and decided to take them at about 10:00. To get the stuff down (it's quite vile), first I put all the powder in a glass of water, and drank all the liquids after stirring it (which, might I add, took all of my willpower), I then mixed the remaining seed pulp with some vanilla Ice-cream, which I ate, laboriously, over the course of 1 hour. I lay down in my bed, and started reading, I read for about a half hour, and nothing was happening, but then I realized that I was sweating quite profusely, and I felt a bit nauseous; nontheless, I was tired, and I decided to go to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
That proved to be for the most part a futile effort, I woke up several times that night in cold sweats, mostly to rid myself of some of the most terrible intestinal difficulties I had ever had. But in between, when I tried to sleep, I got the most horrible visions I've ever had. They're very hard to explain, but it was sort of like my entire life's events were placed upon an amusement park/floating island, not floating in water though, floating in some bubbling inferno akin to the divine comedy. And these weren't all my life's events, these were terrible childhood memories placed along a path on the island from my birth up to the present. I vaguely remember a spiral staircase of some kind. I would open my eyes every once in awhile to be greeted by what looked like small fire demons dancing across my ceiling. My physical sensations weren't doing much to help the experience either; cold sweats, nausea, diarrhea, and a generally overwhelming feeling that I was going to give birth to the antichrist. About 3-4 hours after it all began, I passed out. I awoke the next morning to a 'what the fuck happened?' sort of feeling, and three days of diarrhea.<BR>
<BR>
Andrew would later tell me that those were seeds from second generation plants that were not in fact the heavenly blue variety, If that's of any importance. And I think I can confidently say I'll never try that again. I suspect that my negative experience could be attributed to the presence of the hyoscyamine in the seedcoats? A word of advice to others: If you are considering trying morning glory seeds, I will not discourage you, but PLEASE go through with the proper LSA extraction procedures (for your own sake).<BR>
<BR>
If there's one thing that I learned from all of this, it's this: Don't fuck with things that you haven't researched adequately, because you don't know what'll happen to you. <BR>
<BR>
May life bring you good experiences and personal insight, peace out.<!--   End Body   -->

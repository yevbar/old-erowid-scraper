<!--   Start Body   -->


It all started out with me being bored at night, and since I've been to psychiatrists through the ages and been prescribed pills of all sorts I decided to take a few down.  I took a few EFFEXOR, a few CYMBALTA, and a few PAXIL, all pretty much within the recomended dose range so no big deal.  But I had about 10-15 wellbutrin XR's and I decided to just eat them all, I had read that the experience wasn't fun, and I obviously should have way more research.<br>
<br>
The whole thing was a blur and it lasted over 24 hours, and I'm still having some long term effects after (2) days which worries me greatly.  What the hell brain damage did I do here?  How is this possible with a drug people take 300+ mg (safely) of everyday for years?  Well it was an experience not pleasurable and not difficult.  Just an experience-- This experience could have something positive come out of it, or it might have killed braincells like a lawnmower.    <br>
<br>
At a point in the session my knees started hurting and I actually couldn't stand.  And when I did stand I couldn't keep erect and had to fumble for the closest thing near me.  I thought balance had to do with your inner-ear?  How did wellbutrin do this?  I completely had no balance and was completely unable to walk without a ludicrous hand broom as a cane.  Other things totally gone out the window were Hand-Eye coordination.  When I took a drink of something, the glass would always touch the base of my chin or my nose.  I couldn't pinpoint where anything was- only while focusing directly at it could I pull of that monumental task.  So grabbing doorknobs and glasses I'd just be trying to pull at air for a few seconds until 3 seconds later I'd remember what I was trying to accomplish.   <br>
<br>
Then there was just the pure stupidity and Supreme memory loss this drug made me feel.  I couldn't for the life of me follow any conversations, and when I did catch the end of a sentence I couldn't remember what the beggining was about-- then the whole topic at all--- even if I brought it up.  It went something like this: there was the main point, then me going into a tangent and losing the main point forever, then going into another tangent, then losing that tangent forever.  I had to ask my Parents (who eventually took me to the emergency room) what I was saying and what we were talking about many times.  I also couldn't talk for a reason.  My voice was a whisper.  <br>
<br>
I was seeing more double vision than on any other drug I have ever been on.  It hurt to focus on one subject at hand.  And I would close my eyes for a bit and feel like I was in another reality- then open them and not realize what reality I was looking at.  Like Depersonalization from reality.  I want a lighter for my ciggarette.  I look for a lighter.  I instantly forget what I'm doing so I stumble around for whole minutes, finding strange other distractions that lead to other distractions etc.  Then I Finally have the breakthough that I was searching for 'The lighter'!  Ah ha, and it could take literally 30 minutes of more of this 'fun' to do and complete simple tasks like this because of the Intense memory retardation.  Which is absolutely Majestic.  Scary shit really... I hope this doesn't permanently effect my memory or cognitve skills.  <br>
<br>
I can't believe the power of this drug-- and by power I mean, 'brain Melting power'    I can see this experience being in the same category as Huffing Gas, or Huffing Glue.  Mostly Pointless, and absolutely dangerous.  I went to the hospital at hour +12, but there was not much they could do, as the activated charcoal phase had long come and gone.  And I absolutely did not want to get chained to the bed to await involuntary commitment to a psychiatric hospital.  But the staff seemed indifferent to my overdose.. Checked my vitals and let me go.  But I have been chained to the bed before at the same hospital... for just --talking-- about doing drugs with a counciler.  I was not high at the time, and away I went to the institution.  <br>
<br>
My hand eye coordination is coming back-- albeilt slowly.  I have some hand tremors still... (they were awful) and my walking skills are improving.  I hope that nothing is permanent and this can all just be a memory and an absolute warning to be more careful with drugs.<!--   End Body   -->

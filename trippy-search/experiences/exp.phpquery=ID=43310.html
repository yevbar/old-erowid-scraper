Before I go on to share my experiences with skelaxin I must made clear and reassure the reader that normally I am very responsible with all chemical's and the “studies” I conducted in retrospect were extremely irresponsible. I have learned from the entire experience and though I regret making the decisions I did I am glad that they took place so I could share my experience with the world. Though the events that occurred started because of a sense of invulnerability due to the end of an amazing mushroom trip I don’t in anyway use that as a excuse and accept full responsibly for the choices I made.<br>
<br>
Ok, with that out of the way I can begin to share my findings. Though it is impossible to describe the feelings and emotions experienced I’ll do my best. This story involves 5 people. Myself and my  4 friends which I will call Davey and Mike, my girlfriend at the time who I’ll call Katie, and a old friend of mine from elementary school named Nate.<br>
<br>
In February 2004, Nate came back into town from school in New York. He had brought me back some pills from school as a [very] late birthday present. I was given 14 Skelaxin. I had never heard of it before and my search on the internet had turned up very little on the drug. My preference when it comes to chemicals is mushrooms and marijuana but I’ll try almost anything once. I was hesitant to take the pills at first so I put them in my little leather pouch  with my bowl and weed.<br>
<br>
One night in late February (I believe it was the 21st) Mike and I decided to trip at Davey's house because the setting was extremely pleasant and relaxed. I won’t go into details of the mushroom trip but to summarize we ate the mushrooms at 12:20pm, began tripping at around 1:35am, and began to come down around 5am. For a brief period during the trip I made an unsuccessful attempt to locate my small leather pouch. Strangely I could not remember where I had put it, it was almost as if I had preexisting knowledge of what would have happened to me if I had found it whilst tripping. Finally at roughly 5:15am I was “sober” enough to find my pouch and we smoked a bowl to relax and reflect on ours trips. For Davey it was his first time. He had not said a single word the entire trip but while sharing stories told us of his journey thru his mind. <br>
<br>
As I listened to his story I played with a few of the Skelaxin in my hand. Mike turned to me and said “We should take those.” I agreed and for whatever reason (which to this day I do not know why) I began to grind 6 of the Skelaxin up. I then distributed the ground up pills into 3 shot glasses. I then poured the last mountain dew we had evenly into the 3 glasses. Again I have absolutely no idea why I did that though I realized what a bad idea it was after the last Skelaxin shot was poured. We each took our respective Skelaxin shot’s. It was obvious that I had made a mistake in pouring the Mountain Dew over the Skelaxin because after the shot was taken there was a very large amount of untouched powder at the bottom. We poured in more Dew and took another shot but it failed to clear the shot glass completely. <br>
<br>
It was then that Davey suggested that we should scrape the Skelaxin out of the shot glasses and smoke it. Though normally I would instantly object to such a ridiculous idea but the strong feeling of immortality I received from the trip got the better of me and I agreed. Over the course of 15 minutes we smoked 2 bowls of weed with Skelaxin sprinkled on top. It was very difficult to determine which feelings where the mushrooms and which were from the Skelaxin. The burnt Skelaxin had a very distinct taste, almost like raspberries. The remaining Skelaxin we had scrapped we poured into one last shot glass and Davey downed it. I began to feel very high, my lungs began to feel as if I had filled them with delicious chocolate pudding. Within 5 minutes I heard a loud exhalation from the direction that Davey was in. I looked over in time to see him slump to his side.<br>
<br>
I instantly thought that something was wrong with him so I calmly (though at a brisk pace) walked over to him to see if he was ok. His pulse was fine and his breathing was regular. I then let out a deep sigh of relief, he was after all just sleeping (on his side at that) and I knew he’d be ok.<br>
<br>
My focus then changed and I began to notice how very high I had become, and quite sick too. I told Mike I wanted to get some fresh air and he decided to join me. The time was now 7:15am; at little over an hour and twenty minutes had pasted since I had smoked the Skelaxin. I got no farther then the driveway when I felt intense nausea. I then threw up... all over Mike’s new Scion. The vomiting was unlike any kind of vomiting I had ever experienced before. There was no heaving what-so-ever the puke just seemed to flow out of my mouth. After I had thrown up and washed out my mouth with a Pepsi I had in the car I drove the short distance home. <FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</FONT><br>
<br>
The next morning I woke up and felt fine. I meditated for an hour and some odd minutes and reflected on my trip. I had decided that I wanted to smoke the Skelaxin on a bowl one more time so I could get a much clearer idea of exactly what effects they had. <br>
<br>
It was 9:00pm when Katie called me. She said she missed me and wanted me to meet her roommate who was like a brother to her and she wanted him to see I was a good guy who would treat her right. I brought my leather pouch to their apartment. Mike came along too.<br>
<br>
When I arrived I met her 3 roommates which had met in treatment for meth. It was like the 3 tweaker stooges' snorted crushed up adderoal off of the TV set. I respectfully declined the invitation to partake in the railing of the Adderal, I after all did not care for amphetamines at all. I I smoked a few bowls of straight weed for an hour or so and hung out and talked with them. Around the 5th bowl it was 11:30pm. I was taking out my film canister with weed in it when 2 Skelaxin fell out. “What is that?” One of them asked. I told them and shared the knowledge I had of the drug in addition to my experience on it. They said they were down for  trying it so I ground up a pinch on the bowl. The taste was even more clearer this time. It was a very berry taste, almost like the smell of raspberry bubble tape. I felt the effects of the Skelaxin for 2 hours. The effects were as follows; My lungs felt like they had pudding in them. Sounds became very sharp and well defined. It was different from marijuana’s enhancement of music, the only analogy I can think of is it was as if sounds normally sounded like sitting in a car with the speakers blown then replacing Mark Levinson speakers. Complex shifting patterns of color masked my vision in a quasi-colidscopieal arrangement of color and shapes. The nausea was still there but was neutralized for the most part by the weed I had smoked. After 2 hours the effects seemed to have disappeared. I spent some time with Katie alone, then we left.<br>
<br>
3 days later we smoked it again in Mike’s scion in my driveway. I experienced the same effects as before. However this time we had crushed up an entire pink pill and smoked it with a dime of weed. The colidiscopieal patterns intensified and I was locked in a trance like state of completely tranquillity. <br>
<br>
My mind was a fresh blank page and remained that way for the next 2 days. I had extreme difficulty doing even the simplest of math problems in my head. Mike said that he had experienced the same thing.<br>
<br>
On March 11th around 10pm we decided to smoke the rest of the Skelaxin. We smoked a full pill in 10 minutes on bowl after bowl on some weed. We then freebased the last pill on tinfoil. As the times before I had the same effects however I had a new feeling. It was as if I had shocked the intelligence straight out of my head. I began to feel sick and immediately threw up into the sink. Mike’s face got very pale and he began to flush in certain spots of his face. I starred at him in disbelief as hives began to form all over his face. Upon realizing this he started to panic. He walked into the living room and layed down on the floor. He breathing became very shallow and I stayed with him for 30 minutes until I had to take a piss. I walked to the bathroom, urinated, and went back to the room. When I returned he was wild eyed, very pale with red cheeks and forehead.<br>
<br>
“Why did you leave me for so long?” he said.<br>
<br>
“Dude I only went to the bathroom I’ve been here the entire time.” I replied.<br>
<br>
“You...” is all that he could respond with before his head went back down and he passed out. I stayed with him until ~5:30am when he, now feeling slightly better, woke up and drove home.<br>
<br>
Though the effects were quite enjoyable overall I feel as if I’ve done irreversible damage to my body.<!--   End Body   -->

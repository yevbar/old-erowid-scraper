I had been having these attacks that I presumed were anxiety attacks or at least anxiety related...shortness of breath, headaches, jitters, muscle cramping/spasms, heart racing/heartbeat irregular, thinking I was going to die, etc.  My beloved old hippie friend at work unloaded about thirty Xanax tablets on me in return for a full prescription of Vicodin, which I was bored with. <BR>
<BR>
I was at work.  At two 'o clock a.m., I took one tablet with a sip of water after feeling a panic attack start to come over me.  At two thirty I noticed that I felt a lot calmer, my muscle cramping subsided and my heartbeat slowed to normal.  I stopped shaking my legs and fidgeting. At three o'clock a.m I was totally relaxed, but noticed that I didn't have any desire to communicate with anyone...felt kind of anti-social but in a good way.  I usually am very chatty at work, but I just wanted to curl into my little ergonomic swivel chair and do my job.  <SHOCKING!> Felt peaceful, even a little happy, but very quiet. <BR>
<BR>
By six 'o clock a.m. all I wanted to do was go home and call my lover.  So I did. And after several weeks of not being able to talk to him, I was GUSHING.  The words came, the emotions came, it all came out and it wouldn't stop.  I attributed this to the Xanax because there was no other reason for me to be so suddenly divulgent and warm and communicative. I figured that the drug must have told the anxiety part of my brain to shut the f*ck up and told the love and relationships part of it to get busy. In any case, I am going to continue experimenting with Xanax and try to record all the different effects it has on me.<BR>
<BR>
Xanax seems to be a nice, friendly sort of pill.<!--   End Body   -->

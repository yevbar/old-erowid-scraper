There was a recent spate of reports in the media about the next possible  drug craze - Stilton cheese.  Apparently 20 grams of it before bed causes  phantasmagorical dreams.  The media has obviously failed in its attempts to  kick start the next drug controversy, but I decided to experiment with  Stilton now before the Moral Majority and the granola eating fascists join  forces to prevent people from altering their consciousness -and- clogging  their arteries.  When someone invents a psychedelic that makes everything  taste like cheeseburgers, the Drug War will be officially lost...<br>
<br>
I searched on erowid.org for any existing trip reports involving Stilton  (or any cheese for that matter - see http://www.britishcheese.com/news.cfm?page_id=240) but curiously, there are none.  Is cheese just too prosaic and not hard core enough for druggies, compared to exotic chemicals from exotic plants from the exotic Amazon,  served up by wizened shamans from their pot of boiling leaves and lizards?    Or man made chemicals with long inscrutable names that only biochem geeks  understand?  I can only imagine a conversation at the next party - 'The  Pink Dolphin Yage?  that's so 2007.  Last week, I tried some iso-reversed  methodoxy-psilocybin - it's sort of like ibogaine - I got from a friend of  a friend of a friend of Shulgin.'  'Uh huh.' 'It's -'  'What's your latest  drug, Doug?' 'Stilton' 'What the heck is Stilton???'  'Um...cheese. I, ah,  got it at Safeway....'<br>
<br>
Given Americans' general predilections towards escapism and getting fat, perhaps it is best that the psychoactive properties of cheese be known to  only the cognoscenti <br>
<br>
T-3hrs: I go down to the local supermarket to pick up some Stilton.  There's not a wide range available - Sainsbury's only offers 3 kinds (the  Basic, the more fancy Creamy Stilton, and the British Blue Stilton)  Uncertain what to buy, I buy all 3 (23g, 18g and 30g respectively).  I  debate whether I should also pick up a bottle of wine to support my sort of  pedestrian cover story (a 'party') if stopped and questioned as to why I'm  buying so much cheese.  But the focus these days is on meth addicts with  the constant sniffles, so I think The Man is too distracted nowadays.  In  any case, I will not use my Frequent Shopper card - god knows what sort of  data mining algorithms they are running. <br>
<br>
As these are all Sainsbury branded cheeses, I realize I will have to check  out Tesco and Waitrose branded cheeses as well on the off chance there  might some significant differences in effect.  And then there's specialty  cheese shops and gourmet mail order...  My mind reels at the breadth of  this experiment; I will have to keep a close eye on my cholesterol if I am  going to be thorough. <br>
<br>
T-2.5hrs: Now home, I decide to try the Creamy Stilton first.  It's only  18g - the recommended dose is 20g - but I am unsure of Stilton's safety  profile (or how I may react as well).  Stepping up to the 23g after this  seems like the reasonable, responsible thing to do rather than being bold  and doing the 30g immediately (there are old psychonauts, there are  bold...).  I make a note to myself that I should get a doctor's appointment  for a EKG and whatever else is needed to check out my arteries next week. <br>
<br>
Following instructions, I unwrap the cheese to 'let it breathe' to catalyze  [scientific gourmet gobblygook].  Apparently it will taste better because  refrigeration is bad for cheese and especially supermarket refrigerators. <br>
<br>
T+0: The zero hour...  It's a good cheese, very reminiscent of blue cheese,  but not as strong.  It's a bit crumbly, with a good mouth feel, and hints  of buttermilk and maybe a bit of lemon.  Definitely a better olfactory  experience than snorting caustic chemicals.<br>
<br>
T+10min: It's good cheese, I like it, but ...  almost 20 grams IS a lot.  My taste buds are bitching.  It's not ayahuasca, or the distilled  psychedelic motor oil that I made from San Pedro, but I think being  overwhelmed like this will prevent Stilton from being the next easy/fun  drug craze (fortunately).  I resolve to press on in the name of science. <br>
<br>
T+15min:  All done - the rind was much more bitter and I wasn't sure if I  should, but what the hell.  As it turns out, you're not supposed to eat the  rind - it may have anti-molding agents and whatever dirt the factory worker  had on his hands in it.  Being a dumb American, ignorant in the ways of  cheese, how I am supposed to know?  All the cheese I remember of in America  was packaged in shrink wrap plastic and obviously colored with artificial  colors.  I still haven't quite grokked the importance of cheese in UK  culture, but think I am beginning to.  I mean, if the stuff is  consciousness-altering... well, decent cheese at least.  Perhaps this  explains why cheese in America is crap (according to various Brits) - the  American government would never approve of a decent cheese if it could be  abused by thrill seekers.<br>
<br>
T+?hrs: I don't know what time I woke up, I was bleary - it had been a bad  trip (dream).  I blame eating the rind.  DO NOT EAT THE RIND.  From what I  remember, I was in a room, sitting in a chair.  The only other thing in  this blueish white room (much like the color of the cheese) was a picture.    I forget what the picture was of, but as I was sitting there, dread  (evinced by a definite upset stomach) filled me, then an old lady came out  of the picture, like in 'The Ring'.  I realized then it was a dream, and I  was on the verge of waking up, but certainly not soon enough.  I was  paralyzed and tried to scream, but couldn't get out any sound, despite my  open mouth.  The old lady turned into ectoplasm and then started to flow  into my throat chakra.  I woke up at that point with the distinct  conception or idea of physically pulling this ectoplasm out of my throat  area.  The anima can be a real bitch...<br>
<br>
T+?hrs: I wake up again, albeit briefly.  All I remembered in the morning was that the dream involved cows.<br>
<br>
T+9hrs: I wake up for good this time, on the tail end of the 3rd dream.  This dream as well was sort of disturbing - I don't remember much, but the  climax consisted of a giant cloud of smog coming from China, blowing over  the radioactive Middle East, and hitting England resulting in a downpour of  marble.  The marble of course was blue veined...<br>
<br>
Overall, this experiment was sort of depressing - interesting, but not the  Beatles-delic sort of experience I was hoping for.  Is Stilton cheese one  of my allies?  This was only the first test, and it was a low dose - I just  need to find the right combinations of variables (brand, variant, dosage,  maybe some wine added in as well...).  Maybe it's not even Stilton I need  to try - a whole new world of drug experimentation has opened up for me!<!--   End Body   -->

So let me begin with a very quick overview for those who would prefer the shorthand version. Around 2pm, ingested 8 mg mixed in with water at the beach and felt only slightly altered and had a wonderful time. After coming down and returning home, ingested another 15 mg and had a very mushroom-like experience without the frequently associated nausea and had a wonderful time again, with no fear or bad trip.<br>
<br>
So now the full version.<br>
<br>
I live near the beach in San Diego with my best friend from high school, we will call him A. Our other best friend from high school, we will call him J, was visiting from the other side of the country, and informed me that he was bringing 4-Aco-DMT with him. Having never heard of it at the time, I browsed through the vaults here and confirmed that it was something I was very interested in trying. My previous experiences with psychedelics included a very overwhelming acid trip several years earlier, a pleasant but nausea inducing mushroom trip a couple months earlier, and several experiences with salvia. I am also a daily cannabis user. J arrived and we caught up and talked of old times, and after a long day went to bed. We woke up the next morning and prepared to go to the beach. J had 100mg in a capsule, but we lacked a mg scale, so we simply used division techniques to isolate approximately 18mg. We mixed this into 6 ounces of water in a water bottle and proceeded to the beach. The group was myself, A, J, and another friend B who drove. Just before leaving, we smoked a few bowls of cannabis between myself, A, and J. Upon arriving at the beach, myself and J each drank half of the water bottle, with J consuming slightly more.<br>
<br>
A few notes on setting and preparations. The setting was a relatively uncrowded beach on a fair weather day. I was well fed and hydrated, as was J. We had A, who had only smoked cannabis as our 'babysitter' just in case, and B as a sober driver as backup. Both J and I were excited, with no particular bad events in our recent histories. We were both well informed on what we were getting into.<br>
<br>
T+0- Drink the 4-Aco-DMT infused water and it tastes like a chemically unbalanced water. Nothing awful, just a little strange tasting. The immediate effects are nothing but excitement.<br>
<br>
T+0:20- Myself, A, and J have decided to go for a walk up the beach. During this walk I begin to feel slightly altered. Colors become a little brighter and my thought process becomes a little more random, but not enough so to effect my conversation abilities. No visual distortions besides the overall saturation.<br>
<br>
T+0:45- The effects have now plateaued at a very pleasant body high, overall saturation, and mild euphoria. We are still walking and both myself and J are very intrigued by patterns in the sand. A is confused as to what is so interesting, indicating that this may have been visual distortions, but may have also just been us finding simple watermarks in the sand to be amazing. We begin walking back.<br>
<br>
T+1:15- We have walked back to where B has been reading on the beach and where we started. Both myself and J are still at the plateaued state, with fairly intense color saturation. Myself, A, and J begin throwing around a frisbee and I have an excellent sustained body high. No overwhelming or action-altering effects.<br>
<br>
T+2:00- After a little over an hour of sustained effects, the 4-AcO-DMT is starting to wear off. We begin packing up our stuff to go home. The comedown is slow but consistent. I have completely comedown with little afterglow by T+2:45<br>
<br>
T+3:00- We have packed up and driven home. Upon arriving back at my apartment, we unpack and smoke another couple bowls of cannabis. At this point, I ask J if he is interested in a second trip. He agrees, and we measure out of what we have left. J takes a dose approximately equal to his original dose- 10mg or so. I am a bit larger than J, and wanted to experience more, so I measured out approximately 15mg. We mixed our doses in our own glasses of water and drank them down. J then goes to shower and I plan on showering after him. <br>
<br>
T+3:30- Second doses taken by myself and J. During the time A finishes showering and J showers, I begin feeling the effects. I am walking around my apartment where I live with A and B.<br>
<br>
T+3:45- The onset is very fast, but not in a frightening way. The comeup is gentle, but consistent. It is considerably stronger than before, as I have nearly doubled my dose. I am noticing strong color saturation and mild visual distortions. Anything that I focus on begins to move, but if I do not focus on anything than the distortions are minimal. I walk into B's room and ask him how he's doing and he turns to me and tells me he's fine. I focus on his face and it begins to morph into a exaggerated, cartoonish style face. I begin laughing hysterically and B does not understand. I try to explain and he gets mildly offended...sorry B.<br>
<br>
T+4:00- J has gotten out of the shower and I go in. At this point the effects have peaked. Showering seemed confusing, and I played with the temperature of the water for a while in an attempt to understand my skin better. The physical effects were an intense body high (partially caused by the cannabis smoked earlier) and an intensification of the feeling of contact on my skin. The mental effects are significant. Visual distortions have become not only on the items I focus on, but the world as a whole. I am unbelievably euphoric, with an overwhelming sense of completion and love in my life even though I was just showering. As I am shampooing my hair, I notice the suds running down my chest and legs. I am fairly hairy (not grossly so, but I have chest, stomach and leg hair) and the water is causing all of my hair to slick downwards. The visual distortions make my legs look cartoonish and it appears as though my leg hair is sliding down my leg like a waterfall. I contemplate whether or not I am a cartoon, but then remember that I am not. Every minute or so I would look at the tiles on the shower wall which are white with small black flecks in them. The black flecks appeared to be moving as if the wall was breathing at the same rhythm as me. I am startled but then feel connected to the building and my apartment as if it understood me.<br>
<br>
T+4:15- I have showered and dried off, and A is messing with me while I am getting dressed. He is dancing around the room trying to convince me that he is flying, but I know he is not. I finish getting dressed and am still at full effects. We leave to get mexican food.<br>
<br>
T+4:30- We are driving to get mexican food and everything seems confusing. Not in a bad way, but rather in an intriguing way. B is driving and playing electro music, which I feel like I was not understanding. I am still amazingly euphoric with a rapid and random though process. It feels as though there is no one else on the road and we are floating to the restaurant.<br>
<br>
T+4:45- I am still at near peak effects and we enter the restaurant. I am amazed at how bright it is. I feel as though I am in a set for a movie. I respond by looking all around me for cameras and actors and am confused when there are none. I order my food and sit down.<br>
<br>
T+5:00- I am eating and the visual distortions are beginning to subside to only things I focused on. The euphoria and body high are beginning to subside as well. My thoughts are still random and sometimes nonsensical.<br>
<br>
T+5:45- We leave the restaurant and I am coming down. The car ride back makes a lot more sense to me, and I am tired but happy.<br>
<br>
T+6:30- We are back at my apartment and I have come down almost entirely. The afterglow is pleasant and I smoke more cannabis with J and A while we discuss what we were each feeling. J felt similar to the first dose through the second dose due to the similarity in size. We continue smoking and proceed with our night. <br>
<br>
Overall, I felt amazing. The trip was extremely fun through both doses. I would highly recommend a similar dose for anyone looking to get into the world of psychedelics as it is very very similar to mushrooms, but it is gentler and does not last nearly as long. Although I did not learn anything profound, I felt a lasting overall connection with the world. It is a sense of completeness.<!--   End Body   -->

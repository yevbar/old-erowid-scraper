A friend came over and brought a nice bong, 2 footer, just long enough to comfortably take hits off my lap, he had some kind bud too. I decided to take a couple hits off the bong. It was being passed around and since it was my first time using a bong I was watching others so I could know what to do. <BR>
<BR>
It went around and finally got to me, I put my mouth along the rim so there was no air coming from the outside, I lit the bong and took the biggest hit in my life, probably to date. I had to clear it twice (lifting the bowl out to get the rest of the smoke). When I stood up to get a drink I noticed my throat was a little irritated but I shook it off. I sat down to watch tv, the effects were pretty cool on screen and I felt nice. <BR>
<BR>
Then it kicked in, I probably felt safe using a bong because I knew the water would filter the smoke but I probably inhaled too fast and my throat got screwed up. It felt like there was acid in my throat and when I swollowed it went down and just built up again so I had to swollow again. It was painful, I realized what novice smokers called 'getting too stoned', I had to walk to get some cigarettes and it was freezing cold. My friend was bent too and he kept messing with me, which I think is the most annoying thing anyone can do to you when you are trying to feel better. I think smokers should try things out and not jump off the cliff, take things at their own pace.<!--   End Body   -->

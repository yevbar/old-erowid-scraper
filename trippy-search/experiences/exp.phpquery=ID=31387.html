I have previously taken about 200mg of Diphenhydramine in the form of Benadryl with much different effects such as a drunken tired feeling, intensified senses and such. I foolishly decided to take 300mg of Benadryl on one boring Saturday night.  <BR>
<BR>
I took the pills at about 9:00pm and then ate dinner and settled down to watch a movie waiting for the pills to kick in.  I'm not sure exactly what time I started to feel the effect, but I guess it took about 45-60 minutes.  I felt pretty much the same as I did the previous time when I took 8 pills instead of 12.  A few minutes later really while watching my movie I noticed a delayed response when I felt like movie my body and being very sluggish like if I were in one of those rides that spins around and pushes you against the wall. <BR>
<BR>
It became increasingly harder to move my hands and such as if my brain wanted to move them and my body didn’t want them to move. I became a little scared by this, but I just blew if off as nothing.  Becoming increasingly tired as well, I tried to relax a bit more.  My right leg started twitching every now and then , but not just a twitch, more like a painful jolting twitch.  It would be impossible to just lay there in my bed if I couldn’t stay still for over 2 minutes at a time so I decided to take a shower just to waste time and do something else, so I drunkenly walked to the bathroom seeing things being different sizes than usual and even moving.  <BR>
<BR>
While taking my shower I felt much more relaxed and not as much worried about my condition so I stood there staring at the wall in front of me.  For some reason while doing this I blurted out a few word which I don’t remember saying to some imaginary being.  I didn’t notice anything unusual about this until a next day.  I finished my shower and wobbled back to my bed and a really felt like sleeping at this time.  <BR>
<BR>
After a few minutes my leg began twitching again and also I noticed I was having trouble breathing.  This really scared me thinking that if I fell asleep I could stop breathing and not know it being sedated by the drug.  So I lay there dazed and trying not to worry hoping I would be getting better.  I soon found out that my leg did not twitch if I tried to sleep on my side and my breathing wasn’t effected anymore so I decided to try and fall asleep.  I dreamt of talking just carrying out conversations with my friends ( I might have been talking in my sleep).  When I woke up I felt much better and not under the drugs influence anymore.  I feel so relieved now that it is over with.<!--   End Body   -->

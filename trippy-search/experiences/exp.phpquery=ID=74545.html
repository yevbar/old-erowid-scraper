Setting: 15 people on a farm. We had a campfire, a barn and music. It was a good friend’s 27th birthday and engagement party so everyone had the night off and most the next day and everyone was in a good relaxed mood. We start off at about 10pm.<br>
<br>
Experience: There were only 3 of us who had taken 2c-e before and 3 who had taken 2c-i before so to most, these were unknown. About 6 or 7 had taken either mushrooms or LSD and I’m almost certain all had done ecstasy.  <br>
<br>
Dose: About 11 people dosed 15-18mg of 2c-i and 13-15mg of 2c-e, the rest about 15mg of just 2c-i in vodka shots and the fun began. <br>
<br>
About 30 minutes into it the mood was definitely one of anticipation; people’s voices had more excitement in them and there was a lot more energy in the air. A few people were feeling the beginning of the effects, possibly sped up due to the drugs being dissolved into liquid, so we were all looking forward to the trip.<br>
<br>
t + 1h: It is definitely happening. As I write this I'll try to explain the overall feeling of the night and try not to get too sidetracked into each person's stories but forgive me if I do. Everyone was feeling different, for the 5 or 6 experienced people, we loved it. However some of the newer people were feeling a bit anxious at this point. One person, B, was starting to lose it and become really worried but at this stage he was a lot of laughs.<br>
<br>
t + 1.5h: The trip is really starting to kick in. There are about 3 groups in different areas of the farm and almost everyone has been laughing constantly for about half an hour. One person decided to make the epic journey back to the house (About a 1 minute walk for a sober person) to go to the toilet but, knowing she can't make it alone; get's 2 others to join in the mission. It's impossible to see anything; the path is pitch black and even with lights we still find it near impossible to see anything. Colours are swirling around, sounds are coming from all around and there is a massive amount of general disorientation. Possibly 10 minutes later we finally make it up the driveway to the house (It felt like hours) and she gets to go toilet. <br>
<br>
As we're walking back down the driveway, we see that everyone else has decided to make the journey and upon meeting us, realises they have no idea why they all came over and after a minute or so of general confusion; the 2 of us with glow sticks as lures, manage to draw everyone along back to the fire and the barn.<br>
<br>
t + 2h: Complete chaos. People are running around all over the place; a few of us run off into the grass to lie down and stare at the stars, others fall off into the wood pile laughing, others are tripping their faces off looking at the fire, others are roaring with laughter in the barn with strange conversations and B is completely off his rocker. Out of everyone, B was the only one to have a bad trip. He is completely new to psychedelics and he spent the whole night trying to find answers, wrapped up in conspiracy theories and after many attempts to try and calm him down, was left to sit in a field and talk to himself, but more on him later. <br>
<br>
The time between 11 and 2 seemed to go on forever; there were so many epic journeys, either to the house for the toilet, or out into the fields and the laughter was unstoppable. Unfortunately a couple of people attempted to drive home and weren't heard of for a while causing one or two people to worry to the point where their trip was ruined and had to wake a sober person to go looking for them. Fortunately it turned out they were safe and had even phoned to tell a couple of people that they were safe but, due to the drugs and lack of communication, it never got to the people who were worried. <br>
<br>
<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated or tripping is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]</FONT><br>
<br>
The combination of the 2 drugs took us completely away from the real world. We were in our own space with all sorts of characters, B the crazy 'out of it' one, there was a silent quiet tripper, a small group of leaders that included the potions master, the birthday boy and a couple other experienced people and then the rest; all with their own part to play in the story. The 2c-e was the one that really helped create that new world, the visuals made everything so surreal and the fact that there were just so many people all with you on the trip really helped create that fantasy. The 2c-i I think relaxed (almost) everyone and just made that transition into that new world seamless. It really felt like a 2 minute walk to the house was a journey, one which definitely couldn't be taken alone, and in many ways really was!<br>
<br>
t + 3h: Still high as kites. At this stage, 2 have driven foolishly off, 1 more plus 1 sober have gone looking, 1 in the fields talking to god and 1 more had to be put to bed as it was too much but the rest of us were still going strong. We would be in the barn, with the music blasting, rocking out to that then start a conversation that would leave us lying on the floor in fits of laughter then we would go out to the campfire and attempt to get it bigger while trying not to catch anything (or anyone) on fire. The odd mission into the fields or to the house was still going on and everyone was still having a fantastic time. At one point a few of us were sitting around the fire talking and one person taps another on the leg and says, in the most casual of tones, 'Hey man, your shoe's on fire.' He looks down and see's a large flame burning his foot and this set us all into a massive fit of laughter! Within the minute another person had caught fire too and, looking back, it was amazing no one was hurt at some stage but we all just laughed for a bit more and got on with it.<br>
<br>
t + 4h: The group has gotten slightly smaller. The strange thing I felt was that it always felt like there was another group of people standing somewhere behind me, talking and having a laugh but now that I think about it there really can't of been. This combo played plenty of tricks, not only visually but also auditorally but you really didn't care enough to investigate, you just assumed there were more people around and did something else. Everything was still far from normal but the physical activity that had dominated the first 4 hours had slowly calmed down so there was a lot of sitting around the fire and talking and laughing.<br>
<br>
t + 5h: It was around now that 3 of us decided to redose the 2c-e and take another 10mg or so. We hung out for a bit at the fire and then did another epic mission back the house for another toilet stop.<br>
<br>
t + 5:30h: B was missing. There was a group of 4 of us who realised that we hadn't heard anything from him for a good 2 hours or so and started to get a bit worried. It was cold and dark and he was really out of touch with reality. We thought about it for a while, trying to think what sober people would do (which was really hard!) and eventually decided not to wake the parents (who owned the farm) and have a bit of a look ourselves. Another epic journey to the house and back in search of a torch ended fruitless however our night vision was getting pretty good so we decided to go for a paddock walk in the last direction we heard him. Within about a minute of walking we heard his voice from the top of a hill. He came down saying he had finally found his watch, asked if we were ok and headed off to the house. It was a massive relief. We found out the next day that he had been sitting atop the hill, hitting his forehead against the electric fence for perhaps as long as an hour (judging by the marks left) in his attempt to find god. <br>
<br>
t + 6h: 2 more were dropped off at the house and one of the redosers was there for a while as the 2 other redosers headed back for the barn. We spent a while lying on the ground looking at the stars (what an amazing experience) and eventually decided to have a bit of pot and lie in the boat in the barn and listen to some Pink Floyd. At some point the other redoser came over too and we all lay in the boat having a nice and profound conversation. The second dose really adds another dimension to the visuals with insane amounts of colour and it just fragments the world all over again. We go back out to the fire, with the silent quiet tripper tripping out by the fire, and go about making it bigger. We mission it out into the darkness again, which is strangely lit up, find more wood and accomplish the mission. One of the redosers needs to go back to the house so we accompany him back in the journey, drip him off and head back to the fire. So it's just me, one redoser and the silent quiet tripper sitting around the fire talking and tripping for the next couple of hours. At one point the other redoser farts and comments that it smells 'like shit' and that sent us into the most insane fit of laughter that I have ever had in my life. For about 5 minutes we laughed uncontrollably and every time it felt like it might be over, we'd be off again! By the end of we were massively sore and completely out of breath and my whole head was tingling in a way I've never felt before; it was amazing!<br>
<br>
t + 8h: The sun starts to rise and we're still by the fire. As the world lights up it dulls the colour of the visuals at tricks us into thinking that we're far more sober than we actually are and we are constantly surprised when we realise how high we are.<br>
<br>
t + 10h: The sun is up but it is cloudy, we are playing with the fire a lot, throwing anything we can find into it just to see what happens which is amazing fun :D. <br>
<br>
t + 12h: People start to get up. B comes past and apologises for his behaviour and we notice the marks on his forehead as he picks up his scattered belongings and heads off home. <br>
<br>
t + 13h: We head over to the house to discover most people are up, many haven't slept, but pretty much sober. <br>
<br>
Overall it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. Thankfully no-one was hurt and nothing was damaged and everyone left with a feeling that we had made something special of the night. 15 people on a farm with a fire, a barn and music who created our own universe for what seemed like an eternity. Most of us laughed more that we've never laughed before in our lives and many had trips and personal experiences that we will never forget. <br>
<br>
2c-i and 2c-e is an amazing combo.  Make sure someone has experience with psychedelics before so at least someone can reassure others when shit starts going wierd. Even newbies to psychedelics can enjoy the hell out of this trip as long as they have someone experienced they really trust to know that they'll be safe.<br>

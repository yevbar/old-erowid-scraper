The beginning of my Sophmore year I pretty much tried almost every drug I could get my hands on.  I was always wanting to try something new and then I heard about tripping on Dramamine and Benedryl Allergy.  My friends told me about their trips so the moment I got home I swiped a packet of some Albertson's brand motion sickness pills from the medicine cabinet.  It was recommended I take at least 8, but I wanted the full experience and took 12.  Had some Dr. Pepper to wash them down and waited for the effects.  At about 4:00 PM I took the pills and at about 4:30 I began to feel the effects.  <BR>
<BR>
I suddenly felt really light and floaty.  Pictures looked different, sounds seemed different, it was all it cracked up to be.  Then things started to go downhill really fast.  At about 4:50 I began to feel EXTREMELY tired and fatigued.  I would try and focus on something and get sort of a head rush everytime something caught my attention or someone talked to me.  Suddenly I began to feel dehydrated and drank a ton of water.  I couldn't hold it in, I ended up pissing every 5-10 minutes.  The same thing kept happening, I drank water, pissed, drank water, etc.  5:30 rolled around and I reached a point where I couldn't stay awake any longer.  I sat up and stumbled over to my bed.  My balance was quite poor and vision was sort of blurred.  I was delerious, sort of like that feeling you get when you wake up after staying up late.  Except it wouldn't go away.  I felt like I was going to jump out of my skin.  Every few seconds I would turn and squirm around in my bed.  It was like a nightmare, I felt terrible and couldn't sleep it off.  Every so often I would get up and have to relieve myself for the 40th time that afternoon.  <BR>
<BR>
Hallucinations started taking place around 5:40.  They consisted mostly of colored blotches, flashing vision, changing colors.  Eventually I managed to doze off and didn't wake until about 2:00pm the next day.  Few after effects, I didn't feel tired but I did have some difficulty breathing.  All effects seemed to dissapear within an hour of waking.  Overall this experience was miserable, I wouldn't recommend this drug to anyone.  The first few minutes were enjoyable but they are not worth what you have to go through afterwards.<!--   End Body   -->

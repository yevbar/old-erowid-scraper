Before I even begin, let me just state that I am a 16 year old student and I have been a habitual marijuana user for over a year. I am a fairly experienced psychonaut as well. I have had experiences with DXM, LSD, salvia, nitrous, PCP and loads of other chemicals whose names I can't recall. In short, I've tried everything I've ever been offered and I have (miraculously) lived through experiences that should've landed me an obituary. With all that said, last night was the most incredible night of my life, and it took nothing but two bowls of bud, great music and the love of my life.<BR>
<BR>
Now, I understand that this report isn't very orthodox, in the way that it's not simply about tripping out and getting a new perspective on shit, this is honestly an evening that changed my life and I doubt I will ever live a day without remembering last night.<BR>
<BR>
For two months before last night, my girlfriend (we'll call her K) had been out of town and I had only talked briefly with her several times while she was gone. So, naturally, when she came home we felt like celebrating. We did so by calling my most reliable dealer and getting two grams of Northern Lights sativa. After driving around for an hour or so, looking for a good park to toke in, we settled on a nice field about 100 yards off of a local highway and parked the car. I packed the first bowl and turned it over to K. She took a nice big hit and held it in for what seemed like an eternity, when she blew it in my direction I was overwhelmed by the all-too-familiar aroma of really, really good weed. We passed the bowl back and forth for a good twenty minutes when I decided to crash in the back seat and let the music flow through me. After about a half hour of stoned nothingness, I leaned over to K and touched her fingertips to mine, we then, almost instinctually began moving our hands as one. We were moving in very fluid, sensual motions with no apparent leader, this went on for a good fifteen minutes when she turned her head to mine and smiled. At this point, despite my intense drymouth, I kissed her. It was a brilliant kiss, magnified a thousand times by the euphoria of the weed, it was warm and soft and with my eyes closed all I could see was a picture of the ocean, all in shades of pink and red. Then, I fell back into the seat and began to doze off, but, minutes before I fell into the Sandman's grasp, the door opened and K climbed in.<BR>
<BR>
We sat there for a time, just holding eachother, listening to Van Morrison play on the radio. Just the sensation of being totally wrapped in another person was so divine, I was, 'happy as a clam.' As the music ebbed and swelled our bodies seemed to move with it, then as the song climaxed, it became apparent to me that we had been slowly removing one another's clothes. As the next song began, I realized that we were not only naked, but making love, and I had not even conciously acknowledged it until this point. Upon figuring out what was going on in the back seat of K's car, I climaxed, and became a potential father. At that precise moment, 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door' by Guns 'n Roses began playing over the radio, and by God, I certainly felt like I was knocking on Heaven's door. She looked at me, and I looked back, and I started crying. <BR>
<BR>
I stepped outside of the car, naked both physically and emotionally. I looked at the stars, and I looked at the car. I looked at my surroundings, and realized that I had just become eligible for fatherhood at the age of 16. When I went back to the car, K was crying. We sat there and said nothing for an hour or so, sobered up, and finally she cleared her throat. Before she could say anything I reassured her that whatever happened, and whatever she chose to do, that I loved her and that I would be there all the way to the end. Now, I've heard people talk about eye-contact, and I've looked people in the eye before. But this time, when our eyes made contact, so did our souls, and it was beautiful. She dryed her eye and smiled.<BR>
<BR>
We got dressed, and told ourselves that everything would be okay, and we decided that in the morning we would visit the planned parenthood center and get a morning after pill. We went back to my house, sat on my floor, and I was bombarded with feelings of fear. But at the same time I was happier than I had ever been, because I recognized what had happened as a sort of test of our friendship, and we passed it with flying colors. And I'll tell you what, I've never, ever felt so high.<!--   End Body   -->

It was a rainy day <br>
I had a headache<br>
<br>
This<br>
I have to say makes for an interesting tale of facets, of euphoria, of wellbeing and of love.<br>
<br>
I had commitments last night, I had promised a friend that I would go to his gallery opening… I had also however just received a curiousity, the methylone.<br>
I was never really one for social event such as gallery openings<br>
For those who don’t know, it generally an ordeal for those who don’t enjoy small talk, wine and large groups of insecure people gathered in one space.<br>
However this night I decided I would try the methylone<br>
I hadn’t eaten anything for a number of hours so had pretty much an empty stomach.<br>
I don’t have scales<br>
So I worked old school<br>
Dividing the yellowy powder with a card,<br>
Tipping it into a glass of water<br>
A little stir<br>
It tastes slightly bitter<br>
But not unpleasant<br>
The time now is about 7.10pm<br>
I am on the phone to my ‘friend’ with whom I will join later<br>
I tell him that I am drinking this stuff<br>
I finish the phone call <br>
I feel clearer<br>
Its now 7.20<br>
my headache has pretty much gone<br>
it normally take me a while to get out the house<br>
but I was on the bus by 7.30<br>
and the bus journey was nice<br>
I felt great<br>
And clear headed<br>
With no feelings of paranoia<br>
I didn’t worry about the other people on the bus <br>
I am listening to music, it sounds good, but it is good. A DJ set from Berlin. It just enhances my good mood.  Im tapping my feet a little but I don’t feel like I want to burst into dance!<br>
I get there and ‘there’ at about 8pm<br>
I felt as free as a bird<br>
I flitted around talking to many people, those I knew, those I didn’t.<br>
I felt as though I was full of positive confidence, the kind which is not full of ego. <br>
Everyone is drinking, I don’t want to drink. I don’t really like it anyway. <br>
I have nice conversations, very caring. Conversations flow easily with everybody, even those that I don’t like. Again there is no paranoia which I might feel on E or mdma. My mind is clear. I am able for the rest of the night to deal with all kinds of social situations which I may have otherwise found challenging.<br>
I clocked my ‘friend’ <br>
Lets call him MP<br>
Of course as many faceted as the world is I could not just go up and speak to him.<br>
Oh no… for tonight, in this setting anyway, we were to play a little game.<br>
For no one was to know that we really knew eachother … yes, its true artists are a bunch of no good scoundrels!<br>
Exchanging glances every so often, I began to feel that enhanced sex drive similar to mdma but with out the confusion.<br>
I floated around looking at the artwork<br>
I didn’t feel the forced need to mingle <br>
It came very naturally <br>
I was very comfortable in the space.<br>
Speaking is easy, with only one notable minor drug sounding,slur!<br>
An hour went by <br>
9pm ish<br>
I felt the need to smoke more than usual, as I don’t smoke cigarettes much anymore<br>
But, as with many drugs…<br>
I enjoyed heart felt conversations with friends.<br>
Eventually after much circulating<br>
We decided it was time to leave… MP and I<br>
We went out separate ways<br>
Meeting at the bus stop<br>
Yes!<br>
Now it was time to go to the circus!<br>
Yes, literally.<br>
We happen to live in a city which once a year, for one month only, experiences its population more than double, and this toy town comes to life with music, cabaret, theatre, dance etc.<br>
Approaching 10pm<br>
We kiss <br>
It feels great<br>
Well it always feels great <br>
But the methylone in my brain and the previous situation of sexual tension makes this kiss explosive.<br>
We go to a bar<br>
I am totally loved up <br>
Again not like mdma really, you see I don’t like mdma too much as it makes me feel a bit confused and paranoid, its like on mdma my feelings are not true. They are just chemical. <br>
With Methylone I felt I could let my guard down completely, and let the drug take its course. I see now why its sometimes called Ease.<br>
I ask MP if he would like to join me ‘down pleasant street’<br>
We order juice and tonic water<br>
I dose his drink with about the same amount as me<br>
It is 10.20pm<br>
I am still flying<br>
I feel fantastic<br>
Again within 10 minutes MP has joined me<br>
And we cant keep our hands of one another<br>
Small rushes of euphoria come in waves, remaining just at the right level to remain tucked within the inner self.<br>
We talk about how we feel <br>
Truly and honestly <br>
And its beautiful<br>
There is no false e-talk here<br>
10.50 we head off to the circus<br>
it is still raining heavily<br>
and when we get there the que is long<br>
we continue kissing under our umbrella<br>
needless to say… we are both very much hedonists!<br>
The que isn’t too bad, I decide to drop a very small about of acid.<br>
Small as I don’t want to override the methylone first time round, small also because we are going to the circus, and really there isn’t need to enhance the experience too much!<br>
The acid came on quickly. Although at this small dose gave me that slight headache and feeling in the top of the mouth sensation. <br>
The performance was great, twas Le Clique in fact<br>
I love that sort of thing anyway, I really enjoy this time of year here, as people like MP and I are always this way, and for this month many others come into town, other performers and new friends. I feel really happy in this new environment<br>
I am even starting to get a little full of myself<br>
I begin playing up to the circus/cabaret vibe, I am also wearing my soviet generals outfit… one of them. This is normal for me though!<br>
We both enjoy the acts<br>
MP I can tell is feeling that ‘increased sex drive’ I mentioned earlier<br>
We go out at half time <br>
And enjoy cigarettes and dirty dancing in the rain.<br>
When we leave the circus it is about 2am<br>
The rain looked beautiful on the ground<br>
We wished we could go home<br>
But in our situation this was no possible <br>
We had to eventually go our separate ways<br>
However horny we were!<br>
A taxi home<br>
A kiss goodnight<br>
<br>
I am home<br>
It is nearly 3am<br>
I go into my room<br>
I think im tripping<br>
As to my surprise I see a shape in my bed<br>
There is someone asleep in there!<br>
I deal with the situation<br>
Its one of the lost boys of never EVER land<br>
I am surprised at my cool ability to deal with the situation<br>
He is promptly evicted <br>
<br>
I decide to have a joint<br>
Unexpected OEVs!<br>
Controlable though, nothing too heavy.<br>
I shut my eyes<br>
In a bid to hope that sleep will come<br>
I hear the sounds of rain outside becoming distorted <br>
Intense CEVs!<br>
Woah<br>
I had no idea! <br>
These CEVs were where I saw the really synergy between the acid and the methylone<br>
They had the slight dark side of acid, with similar colours. However the bliss was there which carried me through nicely into dreams of utopia with MP.<br>
<br>
In all this was a very pleasant experience <br>
Better than I had expected<br>
There is only one thing I worry about <br>
And that is, I would be tempted to use this chemical more often for events such as openings and the like.<br>
<br>
I awoke early<br>
Typically feeling as though I never slept<br>
I feel great though<br>
A little tierd<br>
But full of positive energy <br>
<br>
I hope MP feels this good<!--   End Body   -->

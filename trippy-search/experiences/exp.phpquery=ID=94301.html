Alright, so I need to start off by saying that this wasn't my first time doing 2C-I. I experiment with party and recreational psychedelics every once in a while, and this was just one of those times. I was in a comfortable setting, with someone who I love dearly, but this trip was not a friendly one.<br>
 <br>
We took the 2C-I at around midnight (waaaay too late to journey on a trip). Of course, 2C-I takes hours to kick in sometimes, so we just laid around the house until we began to feel fuzzy. The onset of the body high with a drug like 2C-I is amazing. Flows of good energy pulsing through my body, a content grin glued to my face; it's amazing. We smoked a bowl at 12:45ish, allowing ourselves to relax into the trip. Visuals started around 1:30 for me, and they were amazing. Vivid hallucinations, insane colors melting into one another. It was really out of this world. We listened to music, kind of chatted, but mostly just stayed as still as possible, enjoying the trip. Then it hit me. 'I want to be done now,' I thought to myself at around 2:30. 'This needs to be done.' My fiancé was still loving his trip, giggling and smiling like a toddler. I had to pretend that I was okay. I began hyperventilating slightly, going in and out of attempting to perceive reality, trying to get ahold of something that wasn't drug induced. I suggested we smoke another bowl at around 3, and this is when my fiancé decided that he was ready for his trip to be over with as well. We squirmed and fidgeted, closed our eyes and plugged our ears, held hands and tried to not jump out of the window. 'It's just a trip.' is all I could think to say for comfort, but I myself was drifting into a dark place. For the next 4 hours, it was a tear-filled, angry, sad, desperate, awful trip. I remember pinching myself, punching my arm, hurting myself in anyway just to feel something. We were trapped in the neverending void of ego death. Needless to say, when the trip finally began to subside, we gushed about how we are never doing psychedelics again. It isn't worth the mental anguish and pure terror that was this trip. <br>
<br>
It's been 2 days since the trip itself, and I'm still unable to have a full night's sleep, and everything seems out of place. I highly suggest that if you want to do this drug, be willing and ready for a lonnng, intense trip. Not for the fair of heart is the best way to describe it.<!--   End Body   -->

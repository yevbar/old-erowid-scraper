<FONT COLOR="#FFCC33">[Erowid Note: Depending on the formulation used, the author of this report may have used between 2.25 grams and 3.375 grams of DXM.  Both are considered extremely high doses, see DXM Dose Chart]</FONT> <br>
<br>
It was about 7:00 pm at night I had my alarm set to 6:30 AM, and three bottles of robotussin by the side of my bed. I woke at 6:30 AM and down the nasty taste of robotussin. At about 6:40 AM I had them all downed, Then I smoked about a gram of hydro so I wouldn't feel very nauseous. At 7:00 I was done and very very high.<br>
<br>
At this time I had to get ready for school. I showered and all other things, grabed a bunch of food and left. I had done lots of corisidon and thought this wouldn't be much different or any more powerful, accidentally I had mixed up on dose amount, I was used to taking like 300 ml, 10 corrisidon, but then I learned that, that was not a very safe way to do it. When the bus showed up at 7:20 I was starting to feel it a little. I felt like my soul was being sucked from the top of my head, and things stopped seeming real somewhat. It kicked in very very fast I wasn’t used to that.<br>
<br>
I had my classes planed out so I would be on it at a later time because corrisidon takes three hours to kick in for me. That wouldn’t matter I thought. At about 7:40 I got to my school at this time those feelings I was already having just got more intense and noticable. Time started to go by pretty quickly when I got to school. I stayed at the same level of extremity for all of Spanish, that ended at about 8:30.<br>
<br>
After that I went to my next class English. In the begining I started to feel it alot. Everyone around didn't seem real. My body felt like it had seperated into three parts. I felt very very short. The ground got really close to me. At 9:00 I went to the bathroom. I looked in the mirror and every time I looked in it I cryed really hard every time for some reason. My eyes look very very fucked up red and small but big big pupils.<br>
<br>
All of a sudden at 9:30 I felt five parts in my body just start to like feel painfully tingley and just overwhelming. All of the sudden I felt like 'Oh shit!' I through up across the room. I forget most of this so I'll try to explain it. My friends told me things that I was doing so, I have that piece of info. Aparently I lost all of my color I was grey and really really cold, and puking hard. my teacher when I became somewhat consious again was holding my head into the trash bucket and I was coverd in sweat. I then blacked out again and the next time I woke I was in the nurses office feeling much better from puking but still getting higher, my body was comletly numb, It was 10:15.<br>
<br>
I got driven home. When I was home I balanced myself down to my room. It was 10:40 at this time. When I got into my room my wall was like intimidating me. I was yelling at it and finally it was doing it so bad that I punched a big hole in it. Then I threw like 20 more punches at it and we fought until I had pretty much ruined the wall completly. I was interupted by sounds I heard, something was calling me. 11:00, I turned around and looked at my bed. A stuffed animal on my bed was talking to me but its mouth wasn't moving so I knew it was the stuffed animal. It was telling me that I wasn't going to make it and I was a waste of life anyways.<br>
<br>
At 11:20 I felt a surge of energy and the bear stopped talking. My wall all of a sudden started to cave in and out. I thought damn it I am going to die. I was almost sure I wasn't going to make it, but I didn't care. Nothing seemed to matter at all. When I thought about my girlfriend she seemed very unimportant and like I didn't really know her that well and she just didn't matter. Then I thought fuck it then if I die oh well I don't give a fucking shit. I felt like I was dead already.<br>
<br>
At about 12:00 my whole room started to shake but I couldn't feel it. At this point I just couldn't handle it anymore it was way to intense so I went to sleep. I had trouble having my body being very numb but I managed to fall asleep. I had dreams about me doing DXM and they all seemed more real than reality it was fucked. When I awoke at 11 am the next day I felt appreciative of everything and just great. I wanted to succeed in life. I was really really happy and I sat down and worked hard on school work and things like that. Before I would never do that at home because I couldn't handle it. Everything was just perfect.<br>
<br>
My parents noticed the change and so did the school. Another thing that I feel now that I didn't before is, I feel like everything has a spirit. Dxm pulled me so far away from reality that it must mean that my wall and stuffed animals must have one. I was on a level where I could understand that. I don't think that I will ever do that much again, it is just painful and unpleasant.<!--   End Body   -->

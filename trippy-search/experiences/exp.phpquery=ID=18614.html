I recently decided to refine myself some methcathinone from pseudoephedrine I found around the house.  My friends and I sat down for a smoke and massively covered our bud in khat.  So we smoked, my friend A about .01 g, my friend B about .14g, and myself about .08g with a little bit down the hatch by B.  So A, B, and I went inside and about 10 minutes later B and I began having violent tremors and B went into convulsions and stopped breathing. <br>
<br>
B was also on many resparitol, prozak, and ridalin for normal medications.  B was coached to keep breathing and eventually sent home for fear of not being able to help him.  A at this point claimed the 2 hits he took were the most powerful he'd had in his life.  Methcathinone is definitely an enhancer for cannabis, yet too potent when laced too much.  The cheapest KB I can find is turned into astronaut fuel at low doses.<br>
<br>
At any rate, A and I sat for about 1 hour while I talked with my girlfriend on the phone to try and keep calm.  I kept eating food and this seemed to conquer it.  A went home and for about 1 more hour I had felt the buzz, and it soon subsided and my g/f left me to sleep.<br>
<br>
In total this experience lasted about 3 hours and it was extremely potent at that.  I personally extracted the khat with hydrogen peroxide, heated because it concentrates it and works better near boiling.<br>
<br>
Today another batch was mixed and in the end we're feeling quite awake from about 150 mg, but this is surely a great bud additive. At any rate, use wisely for B and I were nearly at the point of having cardiac arrest, for my g/f informed me she could hear my heart beat rapid and loud the entire time.<br>
<br>
Be careful... But don't get paranoid, it seems a lot stronger than it is.<br>

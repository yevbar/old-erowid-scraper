After a day surfing at the beach, I was driving home with my friend at 4:00pm.  I had a bottle of Damiana that I just bought from a GNC store, hoping for a new experience.  There was 90 gelatin pills of 1000mg each.  I opened up 6 pills and poured the contents into half a cup of water, and drank.  It didn't taste too bad, infact it was very refreshing in a wierd natural type of way.  After about 5-10 minutes I felt a little tired and slight tingles in my finger tips.  Nothing great, and I thought it wasn't going to work.  About 40 min later, I was chillin on my friends bed, just staring into space.  I got very cold, and started to stare VERY HARD at nothing at all.  My mouth hung open, and I could feel my heart beating hard, but not really fast.  I felt tingly and woozy all over.  It was pleasant and different.  This lasted about 45 min, getting more intense the whole time.  <BR>

There was a picture of a beautiful model on his wall.  I started staring at her face and blocked everything else out.  It got very personal, and I felt as though I was having a mental conversation with her.  She talked to me, but I don't know what she said.  Then it kinda turned.  I started feeling very sad, depressed, and over all very bad.  I suddenly felt as if the whole world was resting on my shoulders, and I felt like I really messed up in carrying it.  I started to tear up uncontrollably, and just kinda felt like shit for awhile.  Then it went away about 30min later and I was just totally mellow.  Couldn't really focus too much on anything, nor on what anyone said.  I was still tingly and felt like I was floating for several hours.  It finally ended.  I am not too sure what my opinion is.  I don't know if the sadness was a one time thing or not.  I will try it again though.  VERY DIFFERENT.....<!--   End Body   -->

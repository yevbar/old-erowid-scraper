This is a report of my experience with AMT and its ability to potentiate the effects of alcohol(and the resulting sickness), and how I use this data to form a crude timeline of the possible MAOI effects of AMT.  It would be a ridiculous notion to use one topical case study to make broad generalizations on anything, but I strongly suggest that people experimenting with the drug do pay attention to this warning.<br>
<br>
Last weekend I took AMT twice.  I took 25mgs on Friday night, and 30mgs on Sunday.  Both times I very much enjoyed my trips. The effects were a little different in each experience, but aside from the set and setting being different, I would also imagine that there would be a form of tolerance (at least to some of the effects).<br>
<br>
On the following Tuesday night, just two days later, I had a Band practice at my friends place across campus and I decided to drink a bit.  I am usually very resistant to the effects of alcohol.  Even my closest friends usually can't tell when I'm quite drunk, and getting to that point usually takes quite a bit of drinkin'.  For a gauge, I am usually a little buzzed after a flask of Jose Quervo and a twelve pack of beer rarely has more than a medium effect on my judgement, rational, motor skills, reaction time, or overall cognition.  Also, in the majority of cases, I wake up early feelng fine.<br>
<br>
But on this particular Tuesday night, I drank 8 beers and a shot of whiskey over the course of 5 hours, not so much by my standards, but I ended up quite sorry.  I was very, very ill.  I vomited alot (which I rarely do), and ended up trying to dismiss the spins as I attempted to pass out.  There was one factor of this that definately didn't sit right, I was capable of some deep and coherent intelligent thought, but it was so unpleasant to be awake that I'd sooner be hit in the head with a tire-iron. In this state, I was still able to do internet searches on MAOIs and on AMT.  Despite my level of ethenol intoxication, I was a bit scared. I awoke the next morning very early and very ill.  I vomited some more and over the course of the next day, I slowly emerged from my hangover and the accompanying viscious headache.<br>
<br>
It is very unusual for alcohol to affect me in this way, particularly at this dose.  The only causal variable that I can think of is the AMT.  I'm not sure exactly how long two closely placed dosages would have effect, but I do recall a passage of TIHKAL in which four days of anti-depressant effects were noted after a single administration.  Whether the Tyramine in the beer was reacting with lingering inhibition of monoamine breakdown in my brain is not completely certain.<br>
<br>
However, the next day (Thursday, the day I am writing this) I woke up feeling fine and proceeded to drink a protien shake and large cup of coffee along with my multi-vitamin, 5-HTP, and fish body oil (sounds rather gross I know, but Omega 3s are important).  This is my normal morning routine, but it was the first time this week that I had ingested it in observance of the AMT.  About an hour later, in my Biopsych class, I got excessively jittery and experienced a little generalized anxiety with very minor hand tremors.  This is rare for me and it's nothing that I couldn't deal with, But I feel that it might still stem from a contraindication.  This lasted about 4 hours.<br>
<br>
Now I can't say for sure whether either of these reactions were caused by the MAOi effects of the AMT, but I don't want to find out for sure via the hard way.  If they were indeed caused by this, I was lucky.  From what I've read, strokes, blood clots, and death are very realistic outcomes of conflicting reactions of this sort.  I am writing this so that maybe others might be careful on the days following a trip, when it might not be the first thing on one's mind.  I will still use AMT, it is a wonderful substance, but I am going to instill a week long pot/clonopin-only rule following my experiences.<!--   End Body   -->

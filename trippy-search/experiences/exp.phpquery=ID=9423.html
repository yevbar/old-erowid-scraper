Well the day started out just like any other. I woke up feeling tired from a lack of sleep the night before (I tend to be an insomniac) went to pick up my girlfriend and started off towards school. Little could I know that as I sat spacing out in 2nd period the worst terrorist assault on the U.S. was just beginning. The end of 3rd was when the announcement was made that reports had been recieved of these attacks.<BR>
<BR>
I wasn't about to wait for school to close officially so I tore out of the building, feeling that it was a bit more important to begin accounting for my loved ones, some of whom do work in the city (I live on Long Island in a suburb only about 45 min outside of manhattan). After assuring myself that everyone was well I met up with my friend who had the same thoughts as me about going back to school (namely that we weren't going to) so we offered a bowl of sensi to the hope of finding as many people alive as possible. We then proceeded to smoke another bowl immediatly thereafter offering it to compassion for those suffering.<BR>
<BR>
As I felt the effects of the cannabis start to come on I felt as if I should do something to more greatly explore this concept in my own mind. Now for the last few weeks I had been kicking around the idea of doing some DXM, the reports I read on the internet intrigued me and I felt that it might help offer some insight in a time of confusion. So at around 3:30 I went to my local genovese and purchased a bottle of Vicks 44 which contains only DXM as the active ingredient. I worked out the dose of DXM in the bottle to be around 236mg which I was confident would produce a sufficient response.<BR>
<BR>
After watching the news for most of the day and then preparing myself for about an hour, I began ingestion at around 9:45 pm I knew the taste was going to be bad but it turned out to be a little worse than I expected. The pepsi I was using to chase it wasn't as effective as I had hoped. By the end of consumption I was beginning to feel the effects, I finished consumption at 10:02pm placing the come on time at about T+15 min, I hadn't eaten in a few hours, and it was in liquid form so this is about what I had estimated.<BR>
<BR>
Over the next half hour I had a somewhat unconfortable coming up phase which consisted of at times intense stomach dicomfort. However I was able to get through it without puking any of the Vicks up (I didn't want to lose half my does and spoil the effects) by smoking a bowl of cannabis(no better cure in the world for an upset stomach). Also I was talking to my girlfriend during this time which helped greatly. At around 10:40pm or T+55min the feelings of lightheadedness and an overall drunk feeling began to set in,it was like alcohol at this point but somehow felt different. It was at T+1hr that I noticed the extreme time dilation that would be with me for the rest of the night, the five min in between T+55min and T+1hr could have been a lifetime.<BR>
<BR>
I began experiencing what I have heard others describe as 'moments of eternity' where minutes seem to stretch on for an indeterminably long period of time, indeed those minutes could have been years for all I knew. At this point I decieded that it would be a good idea to get up and move around for a bit to test out my new sense of coordination. To my surprise I was able to move relatively unaffected by the impairment of the DXM, indeed my movements seemed to have a 'fluidness' to them, I felt as if every move I made was simply perfect. This was also the time I began realizing the drug was greatly affecting my visual perception, somewhat like the 'double-vision' one would expect from a high dose of alcohol but with a more profoundly 'altered' look to the world and with substantial tracers wherein several colors were contained. I also began to notice little flitting objects in my peripheral vision (almost like moths or some other flying insect) but of course the instant I would turn my head to inspect them closer they would be gone.<BR>
<BR>
Around 12:05am or T+2:20 I began to meditate on the days events. I tried to send out the most positive vibes I could, and I hope they helped some, I realized that despite all the horror of the days events, that the reaction of the American people and of people all over the world was incredible. People who had nothing to do with each other were going out of their way to help each other. It is this thought that reminds me there is a chance for the human race after all, and that, no matter how much ugliness was in the world, there would also always be beauty. I meditated on this subject for around 51 min though experientially those 51 min were the equivalent of centuries of thought.<BR>
<BR>
At 12:56 am (T+3:11) I began to experience, or perhaps just notice more, CEV's in the form of geometric patterns when I closed my eyes. No true OEV's were experienced at this point other than the general warped look of things. The warped look of the world along with the mental effects of the DXM contributed to a 'dreaming awake' type state that I quickly fell into, realizing the seeming un-reality of the world at about 12:59am (T+3:14) this state was most interesting as it was closely related to lucid dreaming experiences I have had in the past, I actually wondered if I fell asleep at any point but I am   resonably sure I was concious the entire time.<BR>
<BR>
At 1:06am (T+3:21) I became overcome by the desire to sleep so after a quick cigarette I got into bed thinking that the trip aspect of the DXM was all but over and that the body buzz I had now was going to be the end of the experience, I would soon learn just how wrong I was. When I laid down in the darness of my room I became enveloped by an entire world of constantly shifting and changing world of multi colored geometric patterns (note this was with eyes open) They were incredibly beautifle and served to reinforce the realizations of beauty in the world from earlier. <BR>
<BR>
The next day I had a slight 'hangover' from the DXM which was manifested primarily in stomach pain through much of the morning , luckily I was once again able to prevent myself from vomiting. I also had a slightly 'fuzzy' feeling till about 10 the next morning which is when I feel I truly returned to baseline. <BR>
<BR>
To conclude, DXM is an intriguing substance with which I will continue to experiment in the future (though likely not for a little while as I prefer to have distance between my more profound psychedelic experiences). Some thoughts for next time include a higher dose (I'll probably go about 350mg) and most definatly to look for either encapsulated or extracted form because drinking cough syrup is definatly an experience I do not wish to repeat.<!--   End Body   -->

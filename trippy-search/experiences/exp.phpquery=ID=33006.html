I had quite a bizzare experience today from chewing a rather large amount of copenhagen brand tobacco snuff.<BR>
<BR>
First of all, the drugs I have tried in the past include:<BR>
Whippets<BR>
Marijuana<BR>
Alcohol<BR>
Painkillers<BR>
DXM<BR>
Caffeine<BR>
Cocaine<BR>
Heroin<BR>
Morning glory seeds<BR>
And Nutmeg<BR>
<BR>
Im not a big fan of cigarettes (mostly because I have a 5 minute coughing attack when I try to inhale the smoke). Anyway, the other day my friend offered me some tobbacco snuff, I figured 'why the hell not?' so in my ignorance I snorted a small line of it (ouch). My friend then informed me that 'your supposed to put it in your mouth dumbass' I chewed a bit of it and enjoyed the pleasant lightheadedness. My friend gave me the rest of the snuff and I went home. <BR>
<BR>
Later that day I thought to myself: 'Hmmmmm.... I bet if I put a HUGE chunk in my mouth I'll get REALLY buzzed!' (I know I'm stupid) so I stuffed a large quantity between my lips and gums and started sucking, I started swallowing my spit instead of spitting it out assuming that I would absorb more nicotine that way. After a few minutes I started getting that lightheaded feeling but it came on faster and was MUCH more strong it was like that headrush feeling I get when my car goes down a steep hill too fast. It was absolultly unpleasant in every way. I also started getting a horrible throbbing headache and some slight nausea. It was like the feeling I get from holding my breath for a really really long time. I started getting paranoid thoughts like I was going to pass out and choke to death on my own puke. I finally said enough is enough and spit it all out and washed my mouth out. Then I splashed some water on my face and layed down. The feeling faded within a few minutes but I was left with the unpleasant headache for the remainder of the night.<BR>
<BR>
It wasn't THAT bad of an experience but it just goes to show that you must have respect for ALL psychoactives even if you think its just something mild and harmless.<BR>
<BR>
Will I ever do snuff again? Yeah, probably<BR>
Will I ever do THAT much again? Hell no<!--   End Body   -->

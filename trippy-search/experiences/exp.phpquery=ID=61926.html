<!--   Start Body   -->


I'm pretty small for age, short and skinny, but my tolerance for most drugs and alcohol is pretty high. I am a daily marijuana smoker and have taken countless amounts of pills in my life time. My friends mom had a lot of left over prescriptions so she gave em to me to see if I could do anything with them. I don't have a problem testing out new pharms because of the experience and educational knowledge I have already. Of all the pharms I had obtained the Lexapro seemed to be the best test subject, a SSRI and anti-anxiety med. I started the night with a burger from Carl’s Jr and bought a dub sac from my homie. Then we traveled to my brothers house were we began to smoke. I pulled out a bottle of Lexapro and proceeded to hand out a few to everyone. I took a couple my self, then halved one with my friend.<br>
<br>
Sat out in the garage for an hour or so when I began to feel something kick in. I was feelin slightly inebriated and very awake. The marijuana was superseded. I could smoke but it didn’t do anything to me at this point. My jaws began to clinch and I saw small tracers. My anxiety was highly increased. I felt like a tweeker. In my experiences I've concluded that I much prefer downers to uppers, so I hate anything speed/tweek related esp tweekers themselves. It was such a horrible experience, and all I wanted was to sleep but couldn't. I tried, I might have passed out for lil periods of time, maybe a 30 min nap then I'd be awake again trippin. I didn’t want to get off the couch because of nausea.<br>
<br>
Then next day, very sleep deprived, I felt like shit! I didn’t want to do anything and I couldn’t eat til the following day. Even then it was difficult to want to put anything near my mouth. In conclusion, fuck lexapro.<!--   End Body   -->

Drugs were a thing of the past. How and why I got involved again is beyond me. Anyhow lets get straight to the good stuff. Speed keeps you up and going. Who wants to be awake all night? I love my sleep. But when I'd hit up that line or two, I set aside my morals and standards. I didn't care how much I did, how gross the drip tasted, or how much it cost me. All I knew was I liked it. I loved the feeling of perfection. <BR>
<BR>
When I'm spun, I'll talk about EVERYTHING, and I sound so smart. I start up conversations with complete strangers or even enemies of sorts. I'll bring up topics that could be debated for hours and they usually are. Sometimes I'll clean my room or someone else's just to make use of the feeling of invulnerability. It's not an extremely noticeable effect, but you'll know that's what it was when you look back in retrospect. <BR>
<BR>
Small time dealers started to turn me down and say they were 'dry'. I was a little upset at first but I wasn't about to let it stop me. I'd find someone to get me the shit I wanted. Week after week I'd find myself near broke. As if bills weren't already wearing me out, I had to pay for my 'candy'. Buy a gram, snort it up, occasionally smoke it. It was great. <BR>
<BR>
It doesn't sound as good when someone simply tells you about an experience, the feeling has to be witnessed firsthand. Sometimes I ask myself if I have a problem but I brush my doubt away and continue on with my drugscapades. Depression kicks in after a night of tweaking. Hair kept feeling like it was falling in my eyes but I have a shaved head. I was trippin out on the comedown. I hated it. Still do. I'm not a junkie and I don't overindulge. I get amped and come down. I'm never going back for more and more. I never stayed up for weeks at a time. A couple days without sleep was fine with me. I know my limits and I stick to 'em. <BR>
<BR>
Sure crank has its pluses but that doesn't always make up for its minuses. Long term problems aren't worth a short period of fun. If you're bent on trying speed just understand that you may find yourself in a shitty circle of people and sick behavior. <BR>
<BR>
Something else I find revolting about the drug is my lack of interest in seeing sober friends. Now all I have to do is take my own advice. All you can do is trust yourself to do what's right. Stay real and don't be doing anything without good reason.<!--   End Body   -->

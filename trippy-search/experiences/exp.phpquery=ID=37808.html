One night, after suffering a rather bad week due to insomnia and stress, I decided to buy some Weed off my friend P. I phoned P up, <br>
But he couldn't come out, as he had just had a fight with his parents and was now grounded. Feeling rather frantic, and wanting desperately to feel some sort of high, wanting some way to release the stress that had been building up that week I decided to take some ground up coffee beans in my house and smoke them. Since I had run out of papers, I was forced to use thin tracing paper to roll with. After some rather unsuccessful tries at rolling, I had a Caffeine Cigarette, complete with a filter I had taken from one of the Cigarette Butts in my room. I rolled had it up tight, and inserted the filter the way most people insert a roach into a Joint. <br>
<br>
I thought nothing would happen and would most likely just end up with a bad taste in my mouth, But I felt like this was a good way to waste another sleepless night. I felt completely normal for about 5 minutes after I had smoked the Caffeine Cigarette, But all of a sudden I felt as though I had just drank a Two Litre of Coca Cola. I looked in the mirror... and to my surprise, almost to my horror, I realized my pupils were dilated exactly as much as when I had dropped a Cap of E the week before. After that, I started to feel really aggressive and invulnerable. As my energy increased, I wrote another Two verses to some Piano Music I've been writing. I felt awesome, And it was definitely a pleasant surprise for someone who thought they would have to sit around all night watching movies for fun.<!--   End Body   -->

This was my first time trying HBWR seeds.  I've had them around the house for quite a few months, but I hadn't got around to trying them.  I've taken LSD many, many times, although not in the past few years, so I was curious about LSA.  <BR>
<BR>
I put my seeds in a cup of water and microwaved them on high for three and a half minutes.  Then I ate the seeds (which didn't taste too bad, actually) and washed them down with the water.  I felt the effects coming on within 10 minutes.  Within 30 minutes I was vomiting, which lasted for probably 15 or 20 minutes.  It was unpleasant, of course, but not unbearable.  <BR>
<BR>
By the time I was done vomiting, I was noticeably tripping.  My eyes were extremely dilated and I found it very difficult to move.  At first, the sensation was exactly like LSD, but as the experience progressed I decided that it actually reminded me more of MDMA.  I had the same little rushes of pleasure, and a sort of warm, 'everything is OK' glow.  I got only a very few slight visual distortions, but the other aspects of the experience were very enjoyable and I didn't mind the lack of OEVs.  I am planning on trying a higher dose to see if I can get some OEVs with these, but I will not be all that disappointed if it doesn't work because they are a lot of fun even without visuals.<BR>
<BR>
One other thing that reminded me of MDMA is that I had a highly sexual response to LSA, whereas with LSD I was usually unable to perform (I know that this is not true for everyone, but it was for me).  When the kids went to sleep my mate and I spent two and a half hours joined at the hips, so to speak, and it was an intense and wonderful experience for both of us (my girlfriend was sober, but said that the intensity I displayed made the experience special for her, too).  <BR>
<BR>
The very best part to me, though, was that with LSA I was able to fall asleep after about five hours.  The main drawback of LSD for me was always that I couldn't fall asleep for 15-20 hours afterwards.  I slept about 10 hours and felt a little out of it the next day, with a sore throat (probably from the vomiting) and sore muscles, but NOTHING near as bad as with LSD.  Nice...<BR>
<BR>
So I will definitely be trying these again, and I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys LSD, provided that they don't mind a little bit of purging at the beginning of the trip.<!--   End Body   -->
